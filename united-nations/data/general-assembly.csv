2014-10-24,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gashc4110.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Migrants and internally displaced persons (IDPs) needed identification without fear of detention or deportation to fully enjoy their human rights  the Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) heard today as eight United Nations human rights experts presented their reports on issues spanning from the right to food to trafficking. Migrants were the “drivers and enablers” of development  François Crépeau  Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants  told delegates.  Highlighting their contributions to boosting economies  he said their remittances to developing countries accounted for a significant proportion of their gross domestic product and were an important source of foreign currency earnings  among other things.  In destination countries  they increased domestic demand for goods and services  which in turn increased total economic output  thereby creating jobs. States should  therefore  strive for a comprehensive and balanced approach  he urged  recognizing the roles and responsibilities of countries of origin with respect to transit and destination  as well as protecting  respecting and promoting the human rights of all migrants.  “Sustainable development requires the meaningful involvement and active participation of all affected  including migrants  whatever their status.” Migrants were silenced by fears of detection  deportation and losing their employment  he told delegates in the interactive dialogue following his presentation.  Firewalls were immigration enforcement mechanisms that were sensitive to human rights and allowed  for example  migrants to access public services without fear that their information would be transmitted to immigration offices.  “We don’t invite them to speak up”  he said  urging States to include the voice of migrants in building up immigration policies  the post-2015 agenda and data collection efforts. Echoing that sentiment was Chaloka Beyani  Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons.  Displaced persons were often invisible and lived among the urban poor.  “Continued efforts are needed to identify them and their location and to assess their needs ” he added.  Residing in makeshift shelters  they were barely protected from intruders and were exposed to the risk of sexual and gender-based violence while facing challenges posed by unequal access to education  health services and employment. Turning to the inclusion of human rights in internationally agreed upon development goals  including the post-2015 development agenda  Philip Alston  Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights recognition  said human rights language did matter  as it invoked the specific legal obligations that States had agreed upon in the various human rights treaties.  The recognition of the human rights of those living in extreme poverty would not guarantee them food  education or health care  but it would acknowledge their dignity and agency  he said. Francisco Carrion Mena  Chair of the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families  recognized migration as an important economic and social phenomenon  one that involved more than 230 million people worldwide.  As potential victims of exploitation and abuse  he supported a human rights-based approach to migration policies and practices as part of the post-2015 agenda. A consistent human rights-based approach included strengthening the fight against human trafficking  said Maria Grazia Giammarinaro  Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons  especially women and children.  Taking into account the massive dimension of trafficking  it was important to focus on prevention as a strategic approach  she added  as well as on the intersection of gender inequality and trafficking.  It was necessary and possible to address trafficking through the social inclusion of all vulnerable people  including migrants  ethnic or racial minorities  asylum seekers  refugees and others. Also addressing the Committee today were Hilal Elver  Special Rapporteur on the right to food  Rita Izsák  Special Rapporteur on minority issues and Rashida Manjoo  Special Rapporteur on violence against women  its causes and consequences. Participating in today’s interactive dialogue were speakers representing Israel  Qatar  United States  Brazil  Argentina  Mexico  Ecuador  Bangladesh  Cameroon  Australia  Switzerland  Germany  Belarus  Indonesia  Maldives  Iraq  Norway  Austria  Hungary  Syria  Latvia  Russian Federation  Myanmar  Chile  Kenya  Liechtenstein  Azerbaijan  Canada  South Africa  Cuba  Iran  United Kingdom  Ireland  Australia  Lithuania  Germany  Czech Republic  Libya  Japan and Netherlands  as well as the European Union and the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The Third Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. on Monday  27 October  to continue its discussion on the protection and promotion of the human rights. Background The Third Committee met this morning to continue its consideration of the protection and promotion of human rights  with eight experts expected to present reports and engage in interactive dialogues.  For background  see Press Releases GA/SHC/4108 of 22 October and GA/SHC/4109 of 23 October. Interactive Debate FRANÇOIS CRÉPEAU  Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants  recognized migrants as “drivers and enablers” of development  as they boosted household income  resulting in improved health and greater school enrolment.  At the national level  remittances to developing countries accounted for a significant proportion of their gross domestic product and were an important source of foreign currency earnings  supporting national income and allowing countries to pay for critical imports  to gain access to capital markets and to pay lower interest rates on sovereign debt.  Migrants increased domestic demand for goods and services  he added  which in turn increased total economic output  thereby creating jobs in the country of destination.  At regional and global levels  migration addressed global talent and labour shortages. At the national level  he said development plans must acknowledge the positive role migration played and spur policies that went beyond implementing security controls and curbing irregular patterns.  National plans must also recognize the development potential of migration and build coherent labour migration and employment policies that match supply and demand for highly skilled workers  as well as for those considered to be low-skilled.  States should strive for a comprehensive and balanced approach  recognizing the roles and responsibilities of countries of origin  transit and destination in protecting  respecting and promoting the human rights of all migrants.   The post-2015 development agenda must recognize that migration interacted with development in important areas beyond the workplace  including in the communities that migrants left or joined  and in the areas of health  education and cultural life.  “Sustainable development requires the meaningful involvement and active participation of all affected  including migrants  whatever their status ” he said.  It should  therefore  ensure a systematic disaggregation of indicators by nationality and migrant status under relevant goal areas  in order to measure the progress of marginalized migrant groups  including by identifying structural discrimination. In the ensuing interactive dialogue  delegates asked questions about ways to protect a great quantity of migrants  strategies to increase data collection efforts  especially for illegal migrants  and challenges to include related issues in the post-2015 agenda.  Other questions related to durable solutions in strengthening the multilateral system and to the best ways to assess progress made and lessons learned. Mr. CRÉPEAU said the first step to protect the great quantity of migrants was to properly define them and tailor a response based on that information.  If they were refugees  he added  there was a regime to be applied properly.  If they were migrants looking for labour opportunities  the recognition of their presence was extremely important  as they were coming to work for the wealth of the destination country.  States had a difficult task in trying to protect the human rights of people who were not represented.  Yet because they were human beings  he said  their voices must be heard  which could be done through the empowerment of human rights institutions and other tribunals. A useful element put in place by States to protect the human rights of migrants was the idea of firewalls  as human rights were better defended by their holders.  The rights of women were fought for by women  he noted  but the problem with migrants was the fact that they were silenced by fears of detection  deportation and losing their employment.  Firewalls were immigration enforcement mechanisms that were human rights sensitive and allowed  for example  migrants to access public services without fear that their information would be transmitted to immigration offices.  Migrants should be able to call the police without fear of being asked for their immigration documents  he added  saying it applied to labour inspectors as well. On data collection  he emphasized that “we don’t invite them to speak up”  noting that migration policies were traditionally created by non-migrants.  There was need to include the voice of migrants in building up immigrations policies  the post-2015 agenda and data collection efforts.  They should feel free to contribute to data collection without fear of being detected  he said. Participating in the dialogue were representatives of Israel  Qatar  United States  Brazil  Argentina and Mexico  as well as the European Union and the International Organization for Migration (IOM). FRANCISCO CARRION MENA  Chair of the Committee on the protection of the rights of all migrant workers and members of their families  said migration was an important economic and social phenomenon.  It was also a fundamentally human process  with more than 230 million migrants worldwide.  On violence and discrimination  he noted that many were subjected to exploitation and abuse.  In that regard  he supported a human rights-based approach to migration policies and practices as part of the post-2015 development agenda. Also  he called upon States to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Currently  there were 47 States parties to the Convention  which sought minimum standards applicable to migrant workers and members of their families.  On partnership issues  he said  the Committee continued to encourage the input and support of civil society organizations  national human rights institutions  parliamentarians and United Nations programmes  funds and specialized agencies.  In order to strengthen coordination  the Committee continued to engage with States parties and signatories  while occasionally holding meetings to provide updates on its work. On the promotion of the Convention  he emphasized that Committee members had been actively promoting the instrument and the human rights of migrant workers through speaking at the United Nations and other fora.  In all of its work  he underlined  the Committee had  among other things  striven to emphasize the need to give high prominence to the promotion and protection of the human rights of migrant workers.  Concluding  he said  the challenge was the low level of the Convention’s ratification and the lack of political will surrounding the issue of migrants’ rights. In the ensuing dialogue  delegates asked questions and made comments about the promotion and implementation of the Convention and recommendations on cooperation with other treaty bodies. Mr. CARRION MENA said he had been working the IOM  which provided great input and information in the Committee’s efforts.  As there were only 47 States parties to the Convention  he called upon States to ratify it expeditiously.  On the challenges  he said traditional receiving or destination countries viewed migrants as a labour source.  In that regard  he stressed that they were attacking the issue of migration from the wrong angle. Indeed  the issue of migration must be on the global agenda to better protect the rights of all migrant workers and their family members  he continued.  However  that could be achieved only if there were a political will.  In that regard  he appreciated the positive contributions of civil society organizations in reaching out to governments and raising awareness about the need to ratify the Convention.  Today  there were many conflicts around the world that were leading to an increase in the numbers of refugees and migrants.  Concluding  he called for attention to the issue to find a long-term solution for dealing with some of the causes of migration. Also participating in the interactive dialogue were representatives of Mexico  Ecuador  Bangladesh and Cameroon  as well as IOM. MARIA GRAZIA GIAMMARINARO  Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons  especially women and children  outlined areas of cross-cutting concerns that had emerged as major themes of importance to the anti-trafficking movement  including the right of victims to assistance  as well as their right to effective remedies.  Further  a strong response from the criminal justice system was integral to effective responses. Trafficking could be prevented  she added  by addressing the demand and supply chain  and tackling the root causes that make individuals vulnerable to traffickers.  Non-State actors  including victims themselves  could play an important role in preventing and responding to the illicit practice.  She noted that in recent years  there had been a series of reputable reports documenting the systematic trafficking in persons for the removal of organs in different regions of the world. Turning to future priorities  she said that one of the added values of her mandate was to show that a consistent human rights-based approach was strengthening the fight against trafficking.  Taking into account the massive dimension of trafficking  it was important to focus on prevention as a strategic approach.  Further  she would focus on the intersection of gender inequality and trafficking.  It was necessary and possible to address trafficking through the social inclusion of all vulnerable people  including migrants  ethnic or racial minorities  asylum seekers  refugees and others. In the ensuing interactive dialogue  delegates asked questions about effective strategies and measures to ensure that supply chains were free from exploitation and that victims had access to justice and to address the root causes of human trafficking.  Additional questions were posed on potential cooperation with regional mechanisms and national rapporteurs  ways to address the mandate’s gender dimension  post-2015 agenda targets and indicators to identify and prevent trafficking. Ms. GIAMMARINARO noted the need to engage actively with businesses regarding strategies to address the problem of preventing trafficking that was linked to labour.  States had the primary obligation to protect the rights of potential victims  she added  but the protection of persons at risk was a shared responsibility.  She asked governments to share action plans with the private sector  detailing actions it expected from the business world in areas such as the selection of sub-contractors  the monitoring of the implementation of codes of conduct in supply chains and actions to be taken when faced with cases of trafficking and forced labour.  A public-private partnership was “absolutely crucial”  she said  calling on the governments to take similar actions with their own sub-contracting procedures and in public procurements  to prevent forced labour. Victims’ access to justice was an essential measure to empower them and to give them the ability to regain ownership of their lives.  The problem was that real access was limited  she added  calling on States to explore obstacles that were hampering it.  Irregular migration status and limited access to legal representation were among the many challenges migrants faced when attempting to access labour law justice. Turning to the cooperation between her mandate and regional and sub-regional mechanisms  she said she depended on them for access to reliable information  calling for interactive dialogues to find better ways to address problems and challenges.  Too few victims were being identified  she said  urging Member States to revise their own national policies and legislations  in order to identify gaps and reasons why victims were not identified. She said that expert consultations would continue with national rapporteurs or other equivalent mechanisms  such as national human rights institutions.  In indicators to evaluate effectiveness  she noted that the response of governments should be evaluated in terms of criminal justice responses and on the provision of remedies to victims in terms of assistance and compensations  as that would take into account the human rights aspect of the issue. Asking questions were delegations from Australia  Switzerland  United States  Qatar  Germany  Belarus  Israel  Indonesia and Maldives  as well as the European Union Delegation and the IOM. RITA IZSÁK  Special Rapporteur on minority issues  said that disadvantaged minority communities often lived in poverty and were poorly represented in government posts  law enforcement and justice bodies.  Therefore  they were rarely in a position to influence the decisions that affected them.  Violence could occur in any country  but was less likely to happen in ones with a functioning democracy and rule of law.  Other relevant factors included past and unresolved grievances  a history of ethnic or religious tensions and the denial or deprivation of citizenship. To prevent problems and tensions  she added  States must consult with minorities and ensure their participation in decision-making.  Recommending data collection disaggregated by ethnicity  religion and geographical location  she added that it was vital to protect their rights  with a strong framework of legal protection and dedicated institutional attention to minorities  in the form of specialized departments or units. While the primary responsibility for protecting minorities from violence rested with the States  she said the international community must also improve its ability to assist States in efforts to resolve violence.  When such efforts failed  States must effectively intervene to protect minorities.  In conclusion  she informed delegates that the seventh session of the Forum on Minority Issues was scheduled to be held in Geneva in November 2014. In the ensuing dialogue  delegates asked about violent crimes against minorities  cooperation to end discrimination  best practices related to protection  early warning systems and representation and protection of minorities. Ms. IZSÁK  replying to questions about the prevention of violence  stressed it was possible to prevent problems and tensions thanks to early warning systems.  Reminding all Member States that no society woke up one day and started hating each other  she said  past and unresolved grievances  a history of ethnic or religious tensions and a denial or deprivation of citizenship were among the factors breeding hatred.  In that regard  religious and government leaders were influential in shaping public opinion.  In addition  she said  deficits in the rule of law  accountability  justice and trust could be eliminated through good governance.  Also  civil society organizations were the key partners on the ground.  Concluding  she said holding timely discussions of findings and reports were among the challenges.  She also noted that in 2015  she would be visiting Brazil  Russian Federation and Botswana. Also participating in the interactive dialogue were representatives of Iraq  United States  Brazil  Norway  Austria  Hungary  Belarus  Syria  Latvia  Russian Federation  Ecuador  and Myanmar  as well as the European Union. CHALOKA BEYANI  Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs)  presented his annual report  dedicated to durable solutions for internal displacement in urban settings.  In view of rapid urbanization  population growth and human mobility  as well as the increased frequency of natural disasters  achieving solutions for internally displaced persons in urban areas must be a priority.  Such persons typically resided in makeshift shelters  where they were barely protected from intruders and exposed to the risk of sexual and gender-based violence.  They were also at risk of evictions and faced challenges posed by unequal access to education  health services and employment. “Internally displaced persons in urban settings are often invisible and tend to live among the urban poor ” he said.  Continued efforts were needed to identify them and their location and to assess their needs.  His report addressed some of the most critical challenges related to finding solutions so they could enjoy their human rights without discrimination.  That could be attained through secure returns to their place of origin  sustainable local integration where they had taken refuge or integration in another part of the country.  Competent national and local authorities had the primary responsibility of establishing conditions and means for the achievement of durable solutions. His report made a set of recommendations intended for States affected by internal displacement  national and municipal authorities  donors and the international community.  “Much more needs to be done to support durable solutions for IDPs in urban settings in a more comprehensive and coordinated manner ” he said.  It was critical to develop national frameworks  structures and policies on internal displacements  and to ensure that durable solution options were included in national laws and policies.  He urged donor States to allocate sufficient funding to respond effectively and sustainably to internal displacement in urban contexts and to devote part of it to profiling exercises in conflict-affected and natural disaster-affected urban areas. During the interactive dialogue  questions were asked about the risk of sexual and gender-based violence for women and girls in urban settings and armed conflict.  Delegates also wanted to know how best to ensure a participatory approach between local communities and IDPs  and how Member States could be more helpful to the Rapporteur.  Expressing concern about the humanitarian disaster in Syria  they asked how the United Nations could ensure protection of IDPs in Syria and other armed conflicts. Responding  Mr. BEYANI said that more proactive steps were needed in New York to protect the rights of IDPs around the world.  Better capacity-building and intensified coordination between United Nations bodies would be instrumental.  It was very clear that internally displaced women and girls needed an effective system of protection to safeguard them from trafficking “and indeed  slavery”. Calling for a re-examination of the United Nations architecture for protection  he added that peacebuilding measures  conflict resolution and humanitarian work needed to be in better coordination.  IDPs were usually on the periphery of urban areas and it was important to ensure that urban planning by municipal authorities included them and targeted their areas  he said  commending the work of the IOM. Raising the profile of internally displaced persons was a major task  he continued.  “When I look at the budgets of humanitarian agencies  the entry lines for IDPs usually said zero ” he lamented.  States must liaise with agencies to ensure that their resources were deployed to tackle this urgent issue.  Further  governments needed to be in a state of preparedness at all times  because internal displacement may arise from natural disasters  not just from armed conflict. Participating in the interactive dialogue were the delegates of Chile  Austria  United States  Switzerland  Kenya  Liechtenstein  Azerbaijan  Syria  Norway  Iraq  Canada and Brazil  as well as the European Union Delegation and the IOM. HILAL ELVER  Special Rapporteur on the right to food  said that more than 800 million people still went to bed hungry every day  while 2 billion were nutrition deficient  most living in Africa and South Asia in remote villages or urban slums.  While the right to food may once have been controversial  it was now enshrined in international human rights law with States obliged to ensure its progressive realization through the ratification of international treaties and the development of supportive domestic and national legislation.  However  many countries had failed to develop a judicial culture that recognized the practice or necessary legal frameworks required to ensure that right. Women  she added  played a vital role in food security and nutrition.  As farm labourers  vendors  unpaid care workers and mothers  women were responsible for food production and preparation.  The empowerment of women should  therefore  be placed at the centre of the right to food and policy-making.  Providing healthy  adequate and nutritious food to all children was an investment in future generations  but 5.1 million children under age five suffered from acute malnutrition.  In contrast  dietary changes associated with processed food and excessive consumption of sugar  fat and salt were contributing to rising levels of chronic diseases in developed and middle-income countries. Climate change  sustainable resource management and food security were among the most complex  interdependent and urgent global policy challenges.  Climate change had already affected approximately 1 billion of the world’s poor and time was of the essence.  Turning to sustainable development goals and the right to food  she added that the proposed goals should adopt a rights-based approach and include mechanisms for establishing a transparent participatory process involving people directly affected by hunger and extreme poverty. During the interactive dialogue  questions were asked about the risk of sexual and gender-based violence for women and girls in urban settings and armed conflict.  Delegates also wanted to know how best to ensure a participatory approach between local communities and IDPs  and how Member States could be more helpful to the Rapporteur.  Expressing concern about the humanitarian disaster in Syria  they asked how the United Nations could ensure protection of IDPs in Syria and other armed conflicts. Responding  Mr. BEYANI said that more proactive steps were needed in New York to protect the rights of IDPs around the world.  Better capacity-building and intensified coordination between United Nations bodies would be instrumental.  It was very clear that internally displaced women and girls needed an effective system of protection to safeguard them from trafficking “and indeed  slavery”. Calling for a re-examination of the United Nations architecture for protection  he added that peacebuilding measures  conflict resolution and humanitarian work needed to be in better coordination.  IDPs were usually on the periphery of urban areas and it was important to ensure that urban planning by municipal authorities included them and targeted their areas  he said  commending the work of the IOM. Raising the profile of internally displaced persons was a major task  he continued.  “When I look at the budgets of humanitarian agencies  the entry lines for IDPs usually said zero ” he lamented.  States must liaise with agencies to ensure that their resources were deployed to tackle this urgent issue.  Further  governments needed to be in a state of preparedness at all times  because internal displacement may arise from natural disasters  not just from armed conflict. Participating in the interactive dialogue were the delegates of Chile  Austria  United States  Switzerland  Kenya  Liechtenstein  Azerbaijan  Syria  Norway  Iraq  Canada and Brazil  as well as the European Union Delegation and the IOM. In the ensuing dialogue  the Special Rapporteur was asked about her expectations of the Second International Conference on Nutrition  the impact of sanctions on exercising the right to food and how she would promote mainstreaming that right into the post-2015 agenda.  Delegates also asked for examples of lessons learned from countries that had obtained food security and for suggestions on how to share best practices  improve State promotion of the right to food  strengthen private sector commitments to food security  and ensure that gender equality was at the centre of the right to food.  Other questions related to the non-discriminatory access to resources  including scientific research on high-yielding seeds  the use of Millennium Development Goal 8 [a global partnership for development] for the realization of the right to development  and the cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Responding  Ms. ELVER said that voluntary guidelines were followed by many governments  with right-to-food principles included in the constitutions of 28 countries.  However  their inclusion in constitutions and law books was not enough  and their implementation was extremely difficult.  Eradicating hunger was not a progressive realization of the right to food; it was an obligation.  Legal remedies were not enough without political will.  In that context  she stressed the importance of policy coherence  not only in relation to food and agriculture  but also in the areas of trade and the global economy.  She also said that nutrition could not be excluded from the work on the right to food. She said that FAO  WHO and the Committee on World Food Security should come together using a new kind of global governance  which should include civil society and the private sector.  However  such pursuit must take caution about the private sector’s responsibilities  and there must be accountability in order to follow a human-rights-based approach.  Trade issues should be examined  she said  but the right to food was more important than trade.  On gender equality  she said that women were at the centre of right-to-food issues.  As many small farms were run by women  at least practically if not legally  their role should be enhanced by way of legal principles and sometimes social protection. Also participating in the interactive dialogue were representatives of Norway  South Africa  Cuba  Brazil  Switzerland  Qatar and Iran  as well as the European Union Delegation. PHILIP ALSTON  Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights  focused his remarks on social protection floors  the post-2015 agenda and why it was a mistake to shun human rights language in the context of development.  The concept of a social protection floor  which aimed at guaranteeing basic income security and access to essential social services  sought to implement existing international human rights law and was universal rather than selective.  By following the Human Rights Council’s lead in endorsing the social protection floor initiative  the Committee could make a major contribution  he said. On the post-2015 goals  it was an achievement that a range of issues of particular concern were now addressed in the current draft generated by the Open-ended Working Group  he continued.  But there were only two references to human rights in the whole document and neither of those represented an endorsement of the concept in the overall context of development. He then addressed the consequences of systematic avoidance of human rights language in some of the key forums addressing development issues.  The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Report  “a true thought-leader in the field”  went out of its way in 2014 to side line the concept  he suggested.  Human rights language did matter  as it invoked the specific legal obligations that States had agreed upon in the various human rights treaties  among other things.  The recognition of the human rights of those living in extreme poverty would not guarantee them food  education or health care  but it would acknowledge their dignity.  The international community needed to ask itself why the language of human rights was being intentionally avoided in the context of development debates  he said. In the ensuing interactive dialogue  delegates asked questions on what to do about those who might misuse benefits  how social protection could be more effectively integrated in the climate change agenda  what strategies could be used to guarantee effective participation of stakeholders and what potential he saw in the exchange of best practices with countries with a track record of success in implementing social protection policies. Mr. ALSTON said in many areas of human rights  there was a division between the North and the South  with an accusation that the North was trying to impose strategies on the South.  But one concept that had decidedly emerged from the South was the social protection floor initiative.  Various international organizations had been trying to turn it into a more global effort  but the South had taken the initiative  demonstrating that a comprehensive protection of social rights was desirable.  It was designed to make the populace more productive and less dependent on the state. It was designed as a universal programme that covered everyone in the society. A competing approach in many countries was the social safety net  where some groups were singled out  and bureaucrats tried to identify who was in need and for how long.  The first approach was guaranteed and applied to everyone.  The second was a recipe for the bureaucratic regulation of a society  which put power in hands of elites  to whom the poor would always have to explain themselves and apply for benefits.  The guarantees of the social protection floor were minimal  but designed to protect those in extreme poverty who needed the assistance.  And while the possible abuse of benefits was always an issue  it was usually of greater interest to multi-millionaires and populist politicians. On the topic of climate change  he noted that a lot of World Bank literature linked extreme poverty to climate change.  The issues belonged very much together.  Delegates should not accept that they did not need to talk about human rights in the post-2015 agenda.  A reference to social protection was not an acknowledgement that there was a human right to social protection.  Reiterating that it was important to emphasize that social protection floors were not a northern agenda or something being imposed  he called the World Bank the biggest obstacle  as the Bank did not want to recognize universal coverage  but wanted closely monitored technocratic coverage  and was not prepared to move in the direction of empowering individuals. Participating in the dialogue were representatives of South Africa  Maldives  Brazil  and Indonesia  as well as the European Union. RASHIDA MANJOO  Special Rapporteur on violence against women  its causes and consequences  presented her report  providing delegates with an update on a number of issues.  Violence against women was a pervasive human rights violation across the globe  and it had reached epidemic proportions in some societies.  Whether in public or private spheres  it contributed to impeding women’s realization of a broad range of human rights that were essential to the exercise of full  inclusive and participatory citizenship.  In that regard  she emphasized that States had an obligation to respect  protect and fulfil human rights in order to enable the effective exercise of citizenship rights.  Furthermore  elimination of violence against women was critical to women’s ability to participate in all spheres of their communities as full and equal citizens. On the most recent report to the Human Rights Council  she said  continuing challenges were identified  including a shift to gender neutrality; a persisting public-private dichotomy in response to violence against women; a failure of States to act with due diligence in eliminating violence; and a lack of a legally binding instrument to hold all stakeholders accountable.  Also  the normative gap under international human rights law  with regard to violence against women  was a source of grave concern to her mandate.  Regarding other challenges identified in   the report  she proposed that the Secretary-General initiated a study on the impact of the continuing challenges to eliminate violence against women. The twentieth anniversary of the establishment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women provided an opportunity to reflect on global developments in the elimination of violence  and to identify gaps and challenges.  During her tenure as Special Rapporteur  she conducted several official country visits  where she had seen many positive legislative developments in addressing women and girls.  However  there was a long way to go to eliminating the problem  which was a barrier to the effective exercise of all human rights. In the ensuing dialogue  delegates asked questions and made comments about difficulties in eradicating all forms of violence against women  engaging men and boys  protecting citizenship rights in conflict situations  active leadership of international community  investments in the education of women and girls  the post-2015 agenda  cooperation between United Nations entities  normative and practical measures  the role of legislation and community  unreported incidents  and best practices to solve the root causes. Ms. MANJOO said the biggest challenge in addressing violence against women was the lack of legislation and effective implementation of existing measures.  Lack of effective implementation of those measures led women and girls to sometimes decide against using justice systems.  National action plans tended to be symbolic rather than practical  she continued.  Often  those plans did not come with adequate political power  budget allocations and human resources.  Among other challenges were the failure of States to act with due diligence in eliminating violence against women  and the lack of a legally binding instrument to hold all stakeholders accountable. The normative gap under the international human rights law should provide a better link between local and global protocols  she said.  The international community was facing an epidemic of discrimination and violence against women  which was not addressed adequately.  The numbers of women dying in conflict areas and being beaten by their partners were increasing  she underlined.  She said men and boys must be allies of women.  Concluding  she called upon countries to take the kind of approaches needed to eliminate barriers against women. Also participating in the interactive dialogue were representatives of Chile  United States  United Kingdom  Canada  Cameroon  Norway  Switzerland  Ireland  Australia  Slovenia  Lithuania  Germany  Czech Republic  Libya  Argentina  Japan  Netherlands  and Iran  as well as the European Union.   Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-24,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gadis3510.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Last year’s chemical attacks in Syria “shocked an entire world” and were a reminder that the use of weapons of mass destruction remained a serious threat  heard the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) as it began its thematic debate on weapons of mass destruction. The representative of Norway  on behalf of the Nordic countries  said the mission to eliminate Syria’s declared chemical weapons was “new and unchartered” territory for the international community  which  despite the ongoing brutal civil war  had succeeded.  At the same time  she said  reports of recent systematic and repeated use of chlorine gas against civilians in Syria were deeply concerning.  The use of that toxic chemical as a weapon was a clear breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The representative of France said the fact-finding mission’s conclusion that chlorine had been used “systemically and repeatedly” as a chemical weapon in Syria in 2014 were unequivocal.  The country must assure the international community that its chemical programme was completely and irreversibly dismantled by clarifying gaps in its initial declaration and destroying production facilities. The representative of the European Union condemned all use of chemical weapons in Syria as a violation of international law  a war crime and a crime against humanity  stressing that the perpetrators must be held accountable. At the same time  she commended the international community for its effective and prompt response  which had led to the removal and destruction of the declared Syrian chemicals.  That was a significant step towards the complete and irreversible dismantling of the country’s chemical weapons programme  she said. The chemical demilitarization of Syria  said the representative of the Russian Federation  was a major achievement in the field of strengthening the non-proliferation and disarmament regime.  The international community should recall that the whole operation became possible only after achieving a highly complex political agreement between the Russian Federation and the United States  and relevant intergovernmental agreements between the Russian Federation and Syria.  As a result  he said  Syria had taken an historic decision to relinquish its chemical weapons.  He cautioned against trying to “hype this theme” again.  Of course  any evidence of the use of chemical agents against civilians should be analysed by experts as part of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.  However  until the conclusion of such investigations  any judgements passed could only be considered as a politicized and baseless conjecture. Along with the focus on chemical weapons  speakers warned that sight must not be lost of the threat posed by biological weapons  whether in the hands of States or non-State actors. Despite efforts to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention  said the representative of the United States  the agenda had not been matched by the resources or political will needed to deliver results.  The delegate from Japan said the universalization of the Biological Weapons Convention had become more important than ever to enhance international security because advancement in life science could increase biological threats if misused.  Also speaking were the representatives of Indonesia (on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement)  Egypt (on behalf of the Arab Group  Barbados (on behalf of the Caribbean Community  CARICOM)  Suriname (on behalf of the Union of South American States  UNASUR)  India  Republic of Korea  Mexico  Cuba  Qatar and Colombia. A panel discussion on Regional Disarmament and Security heard from representatives of the Regional Disarmament Branch of the United Nations Office of Disarmament Affairs; the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific (UNRCPD)  the United Nations Centre for Peace Disarmament  and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean (UNILIREC)  and the Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa. The First Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. on Monday  27 October to continue its thematic discussions. Background The First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) met today to begin its thematic debate on other weapons of mass destruction.  For more background  see Press Release GA/DIS/3497. Panel  Regional Disarmament and Security XIAOYU WANG  Officer-in-Charge  Regional Disarmament Branch  United Nations Office of Disarmament Affairs  expressed gratitude to States that had made financial and/or in-kind contributions to the Regional Centres in support of their programmes.  Capacity-building was central to promoting and implementing norms and instruments at the regional  subregional and international levels.  The Centres had undertaken more than 90 activities funded from extra-budgetary contributions  focusing on assisting  upon request  Member States in building their national capacities  he said  adding that the Office for Disarmament Affairs had made progress in integrating disarmament and arms control programmes into the United Nations’ overall regional and subregional strategies  where relevant.  He also spoke on behalf of the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific  noting that  since its last report  the Centre had undertaken a number of activities around promoting dialogue and confidence building; capacity-building; and peace and disarmament education.  Elaborating on those initiatives  he said the Centre had organized the twelfth UN-ROK Joint Conference on Disarmament and Non-proliferation Issues in Jeju  Republic of Korea.  With the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association  it had also jointly organized an International Workshop on Information and Cyber Security in Beijing.  In May  the Regional Centre had organized a capacity-building workshop on small arms control in cooperation with the Ministry of Defence and Foreign Affairs of Myanmar  in Nay Pyi Taw. Moreover  as a pilot project  the Centre had worked with Nepal’s Ministry of Education to integrate peace and disarmament education content into existing curriculums and textbooks in Nepalese schools. MARCO KALBUSCH  Director of the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa  said that the Centre’s activities had contributed to the implementation of the United Nations Integrated Strategy for the Sahel  in coordination with other agencies of the United Nations System  the Kinshasa Convention on Small Arms  and the Central African Roadmap on non-proliferation and combatting terrorism.  The Centre  he said  remained active in coordination forums on peace and security issues on the continent.  On small arms and light weapons  the Centre’s activities contributed to the implementation of the 2001 Programme of Action  as well as to the African strategy and action plan for the control of small arms and light weapons and African subregional instruments.  Turning to the Arms Trade Treaty  he noted that the Regional Centre had advocated for the Treaty’s signature and ratification and provided substantive support to regional and non-governmental organizations in their advocacy activities.  On weapons of mass destruction  he said that the Centre had worked in the past year to promote the Biological Weapons Convention in Africa  and supported States in the Convention’s implementation. CAROLYNE MELANIE REGIMBAL  Director of the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace  Disarmament and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean  said that  in addition to the long-standing small arms technical support  the Centre had been providing assistance to requesting States and this year had launched “novel projects” and “practical tools”.  In that context of the new Arms Trade Treaty  it offered an “implementation course” for Latin American States  which included a first ever regional training course in Costa Rica.  The Centre’s course complemented the resources provided by the Office for Disarmament Affairs and had been designed and developed with the support of Mexico  Germany and Spain.  It had also benefitted from the input of numerous international arms trade experts.  On small arms and light weapons  she noted that 2014 marked the completion of the Centre’s three-phased Caribbean stockpile management and small arms destruction assistance package and confirmed that all the objectives set by States were met and  in many cases  were surpassed. VLADIMIR YERMAKOV (Russian Federation) said that yesterday’s English press release had stated that “despite a ceasefire agreement signed between Ukraine and Russia  the United States has supported an unconstitutional coup d’état in Ukraine”.  That  he said  was a gross violation of one of the main points of the statement.  It should have read: “After the Foreign Ministers of Germany  France and Poland signed last February the agreement on the settlement of political situation in Ukraine  these agreements have been totally violated the next day  and the US together with the European Union supported the armed and anti-constitutional coup d’état in Ukraine  and helped the ultra-national forces to come to power in Kiev that literally exploded the country from inside  and our world turned upside down”.  That  he said  was what had been stated in the room by the Russian delegation.  Pitting Russia and Ukraine against each other would not work.  They were two sovereign States.  They were fraternal peoples  whose histories went back and who shared family ties. KAMAPRADIPTA ISNOMO (Indonesia)  speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  said it was important to prevent the emergence of new types of weapons of mass destruction  monitor the situation in that regard and take international action  as required.  The Movement States parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention called on all possessor States parties to ensure the complete destruction of their remaining chemical weapons within the final extended deadline.  The Movement’s States parties to the Biological Weapons Convention urged the resumption of multilateral negotiations to conclude a non-discriminatory legally binding protocol  dealing with all the treaty’s articles  in a balanced and comprehensive manner to sustainably strengthen it.  He called on all Member States to support international efforts and to take and strengthen national measures that would prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction  their delivery means  and materials and technologies related to their manufacture.  Noting the Security Council resolutions on weapons of mass destruction  he underscored the need to ensure that action by the Council did not undermine the Charter  or existing multilateral treaties on the subject or international organizations established in that regard.  He cautioned against the Council’s practice of using its authority to define legislative requirements for Member States in implementing its decisions  and stressed that non-State actors’ acquisition of mass destruction weapons should be addressed in an inclusive manner by the General Assembly  taking into account the views of all Member States.  AMR FATHI ALJOWAILY (Egypt)  speaking on behalf of the Arab Group and associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said the Group’s cardinal position was to realize a world free of weapons of mass destruction  be they nuclear  biological or chemical  with special attention to the target of establishing a zone free of those weapons in the Middle East.  The Arab Group had always supported those multilateral agreements and continued to participate in their work.  The first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament had defined clearly and with consensus the priorities of disarmament of all nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction  and in that respect  priority should be given to nuclear disarmament.  He said the Arab Group was translating that conviction into practical measures by  among others  seeking to rid the Middle East region from all weapons of mass destruction in line with the Plan of Action adopted at the 2010 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference.  There was no doubt that the universalization of the NPT required Israel’s accession as a non-nuclear-weapon State.  While the Arab Group abided by its obligations  Israel continued its position of rejecting adherence to the NPT. The Iraqi delegation had submitted a report to the Secretariat on the activities and efforts of the Arab Group  he said  and it was now incumbent on the remaining parties to resume their responsibility towards establishing a zone in the Middle East.  The Arab Group welcomed all efforts that sought to accelerate efforts in that regard  and had deposited official letters with the Secretary-General reflecting that commitment.  He was convinced that the First Committee would play its role by helping to ensure the majority adoption of “L.2”. JULIETTE BABB-RILEY (Barbados)  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  said the capabilities and tactics of terrorists were becoming ever more sophisticated  posing an ever evolving and asymmetric threat to national and international peace and security.  Terrorists’ acquisition of weapons of mass destruction was a very real possibility and must be met with firm political will  constant vigilance and international collaboration.  Member States must take and strengthen national measures to prevent that occurrence.  In that  cross-sectoral partnerships between Governments  industry and communities were essential. She said the recent use of chemical weapons in Syria represented a timely reminder of the urgent need for the international community to deepen its commitment to eliminate them  as well as all nuclear  radiological and biological weapons and their delivery systems.  CARICOM States continued to commit considerable resources to implement legislation  attendant regulations and administrative controls to prevent the transhipment  transit  import  export  and brokering of dual-use materials and other strategic goods  which could be used to produce weapons of mass destruction.  In particular  they continued to focus on the development of adequate export control infrastructure  control lists governing strategic items  as well as the training of enforcement and operational personnel to detect  identify  and interdict those prohibited commodities and to prosecute violations where appropriate. MAY-ELIN STENER (Norway)  speaking on behalf of the Nordic countries  said last year’s terrible chemical attacks in Syria “shocked an entire world and reminded us that the use of weapons of mass destruction continues to be a serious threat”.  The elimination of Syria’s declared chemical weapons  in line with Security Council resolution 2118 (    ) was not “almost completed”.  It was essential to remove those weapons from Syria to ensure they would not be used again against the civilian population or fall into the hands of militant groups.  The international mission to remove and destroy those weapons was unprecedented.  Despite the ongoing brutal civil war  the international community had succeeded in removing Syria’s declared weapons in a peaceful manner.  “This is the first time a country’s arsenal of weapons of mass destruction has been removed in such a way.” Commending the international cooperation on that mission and the countries and organizations that had assisted it  she said that  in many ways  the operations represented new and unchartered territory for the international community  from which lessons should be learned.  The Nordic countries were deeply concerned that the fact-finding mission of the Organisation on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) had confirmed reports of recent systematic and repeated use of chlorine gas against civilians in Syria.  The use of that toxic chemical as a weapon was a clear breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  All perpetrators must be held accountable  she said  voicing support for the OPCW’s continued mission.  Its latest information was “clear-cut”  and had included reports from witnesses that attacks were invariably linked to the use of helicopters; only the Syrian regime possessed the capability to use helicopters in that way.  More broadly  she said that destruction of chemical weapons in possessor States was a “vital task  and is far from completed”.  In that connection  the Nordic countries urged the Russian Federation  the United States and Libya to expedite destruction of their arsenals  and urged all countries not party to the Convention to accede and become members of the “OPCW”.  Fostering international cooperation in the peaceful uses of chemistry and the prevention of terrorism were also important goals.  Turning to the Biological Weapons Convention  she said biotechnology was a rapidly evolving science  and ambitious and forward-looking initiatives were required to strengthen the Convention.  Ongoing efforts to reinforce it should include strengthening the Secretary-General’s investigative mechanism for alleged use of biological weapons.  NICOLE HEW A KEE (Suriname)  speaking on behalf of the Union of South American States (UNASUR)  strongly condemned the existence of chemical and biological weapons  and reiterated that their use was both a war crime and a crime against humanity.  She reaffirmed the Union’s commitment to the prohibition of the development  production  acquisition  transfer  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons  and to their total elimination  as agreed in the Chemical Weapons Convention.  She expressed concern about the possibility that chlorine gas was used on civilians in Syria  and condemned the attack against the Convention’s fact finding mission there.  She welcomed Syria’s accession to the Convention and acknowledged its progress on eliminating its chemical weapons programme. She called on States that had not yet acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention to do so promptly  and to eliminate those stockpiles  asking that any States’ parties’ possessors of those weapons destroy their arsenals within the agreed timeframe.  Regarding biological weapons  she reaffirmed the Union’s readiness to advance the implementation of the Biological Weapons Convention  and shared the idea that effective international action against biological threats needed to be universal  legally binding and non-discriminatory. CLARA GANSLANDT  representative of the European Union delegation  condemned all use of chemical weapons in Syria as a violation of international law  a war crime and a crime against humanity  stressing that the perpetrators must be held accountable.  The effective and prompt response by the international community leading to the removal and destruction of the declared Syrian chemicals was a significant step towards the needed complete and irreversible dismantling of the country’s chemical weapons programme.  Noting the Union’s contribution of 17 million euros to that effort  she said that the strict application of the Chemical Weapons Convention must be guaranteed.  She further called on States parties to the Biological Weapons Convention to meet the requirements set by successive review conferences. She said that international cooperation was also vital to prevent non-State actors from acquiring weapons of mass destruction.  The Union had adopted projects in support of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004)  including assistance to third countries in their compliance efforts  and would support the adoption of the biennial First Committee resolution “Preventing the acquisition by terrorists of radioactive sources”.  Expressing concern at tests of short- and medium-range missiles recently conducted by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran “outside” all transparency and pre-notification schemes and in violation of Council resolutions  and about the Syrian Government’s use of hundreds of ballistic missiles  called for universal adherence to the Hague Code of Conduct and noted the importance of export controls to prevent proliferation. VENKATESH VARMA (India)  associating with Non-Aligned Movement  said his delegation attached high importance to the Chemical and Biological Weapons Conventions as examples of non-discriminatory disarmament treaties aimed at the total elimination of specific types of weapons of mass destruction.  He reaffirmed that disarmament was a primary goal of the Chemical Weapons Convention and should remain the priority until the complete destruction of all stocks.  India had completed the destruction of its chemical weapon stockpiles in 2009 within that Convention’s stipulated timeframe.  The use of chemical weapons anywhere and by anyone must be condemned and the international norm against the use of chemical weapons must not be breached. India  he said  had contributed to international efforts in line with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) for the destruction of Syria’s declared chemical weapon stockpiles.  Further  India remained committed to improving the effectiveness of the Biological Weapons Convention.  It was critical for the success of that treaty that its obligations were fully and effectively implemented.  India attached high importance to the full and effective implementation of its article X.  India had filed a report in relation to Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) as well as submitted periodic updates.  His country was also committed to maintaining the highest international standards with reference to the control of chemical  biological and toxin items.  In that regard  it had made considerable progress in its engagement with the Australia Group and other export control regimes with a view to seeking full membership. YOUNG-JIP AHN (Republic of Korea) said that in order to prevent the use of chemical weapons  universal adherence to the Convention must be achieved.  The Biological Weapons Convention was the first to ban a whole type of weapons of mass destruction; however the regime faced unique challenges with advances in biotechnology and life science and the widespread availability of that technology.  In light of increasing potential threats  that Convention needed to be reinforced if it was to adequately address those challenges while still guaranteeing the peaceful use of biotechnology.  Efforts to strengthen that Convention’s regime should start with an effective implementation of the Convention  including by enacting and enforcing appropriate national legislative measures.  Universality of the Convention was another pillar for a stronger regime.  In that regard  he welcomed Myanmar’s recent progress in the ratification of the Convention. CLAUDIA YURIRIA GARCÍA GUIZA (Mexico) said that a system for international peace and security should not be maintained on the basis of weapons of mass destruction  but rather on the basis of social development  international justice and the implementation of the rule of law.  She said that major progress had been made in global disarmament and non-proliferation  but more was needed to rid the world of those weapons.  She praised the “OPCW” for the critical role it played in Syria  particularly those in the field carrying out the programme.  Those weapons’ complete destruction before the deadline was an historic event in efforts to build a world free of weapons of mass destruction. The speaker commended the Biological Weapons Convention as a fundamental pillar for the international disarmament regime  noting that the current situation in West Africa due to Ebola was a warning to the international community about questions concerning global public health.  On that issue  she said it was crucial for the Biological Weapons Convention develop synergies with the World Health Organization (WHO)  the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health to complement its efforts. ROBERT A. WOOD (United States) noted that last year  the Security Council had welcomed the decision of the OPCW that legally mandate the complete elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons programme.  Those decisions were “an historic and unprecedented achievement”.  However  serious concerns remained  including Syria’s use of chemical weapons in direct contravention of its obligation under Security Council resolution 2118 (2013)  the Chemical Weapons Convention and the decisions of the OPCW Executive Council.  On 10 September  the latter body’s fact-finding mission had confirmed the use of chemical weapons in Syria.  The mission’s second report contains a “compelling set of conclusions and evidentiary findings implicating the Syrian Government in deadly chemical weapons attacks” during April and May.  The mission expressed a high degree of confidence that chlorine gas was used as a weapon  “systematically and repeatedly” in northern Syria.  The mission emphasized that “`in describing the incidents involving the release of toxic chemicals  witnesses invariably connected the devices to helicopters flying overhead’.”  It was well known that “only the Syrian military possesses the capability to use helicopters in such attacks”.  He said that the use of chlorine was a clear breach of both the Convention and resolution 2118 (2013) and it raised serious concerns about Syria’s willingness to comply with its treaty obligations not to possess chemical weapons. The United States was also concerned about “gaps  discrepancies and inconsistencies” in Syria’s declaration  which gave rise to important questions and concerns about his accuracy and completely.  Syria must provide the international community with “credible evidence to support its assurances that it has fully abandoned its chemical weapons programme”.  Complete and accurate declarations must be provided  and destruction of Syria’s remaining chemical weapons production facilities must be completed “The Syrian CW file remains open and will not be closed until all of these issues are addressed”.  At the same time  he said  sight must not be lost of the threat posed by biological weapons  whether in the hands of States or non-State actors.  The Biological Weapons Convention embodied “an aspiration as profound as that of the CWC:  to completely exclude the possibility of biological agents and toxins being used as weapons”.  The United States strongly supported the Biological Weapons Convention  and despite efforts to strengthen it  the agenda had not been matched by the resources or political will needed to deliver results.  Even absent agreement on how to go about it all  there is agreement on the need to find ways to strengthen confidence that the parties to the Biological Weapons Convention were living up to their obligations. VLADIMIR ERMAKOV (Russian Federation) called on all partners in the Chemical Weapons Convention to fully fulfil its provisions and create national legislation and organizations to do so.  He also called on all States that had not signed that Convention to do so forthwith.  A major achievement in the field of strengthening the non-proliferation and disarmament regime was the chemical demilitarization of Syria.  The international community should not forget that the whole operation became possible only after achieving a highly complex political agreement between the Russian Federation and the United States  and relevant intergovernmental agreements between the Russian Federation and Syria.  As a result  Syria was in a highly complex international political condition and had taken an historic decision to relinquish its chemical weapons. In short order and in full compliance with its commitments  Syria had abandoned its chemical arsenal  he said.  Official resolutions from the United Nations and the OPCW repeatedly stressed the high level of cooperation from the Syrian Government.  As a result  the elimination of the emergency dimension of the so-called Syrian chemical dossier had been achieved.  Now it should be considered under regular procedure under the OPCW.  In that sense  he cautioned against trying to “hype this theme” again.  Of course  any evidence of the use of chemical agents against civilians should be analysed by experts as part of the OPCW.  However  until the conclusion of such investigations  any judgements passed could only be considered as a politicized and baseless conjecture. Turning to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention  he said it was “no secret” to anyone that many achievements in the field of biotechnology had potential for dual use.  The main weak point for that treaty was the lack of a way to control and monitor the compliance of commitments.  It was clear that the Convention had not grown any stronger.  All knew that  by itself  it did not contain a direct ban on the use of biological weapons  and in that regard  drew on the authority of the Geneva Protocol; that should be further strengthened by universalizing it and by the lifting by States of their earlier reservations for allowing for retaliatory use of chemical and biological weapons.  He commended Portugal for lifting its national reservations on the Geneva Protocol  and called on all States concerned to follow that example. IVIAN DEL SOL DOMINGUEZ (Cuba)  associating with Non-Aligned Movement  reiterated its appeal for general and complete disarmament.  She condemned the use of chemical weapons  irrespective of who used them or where they were used  and reiterated the need for all States to comply with their obligations of non-proliferation of all mass destruction weapons.  On chemical weapons  she said it was urgent to adopt a plan of action towards the implementation of article XI of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  She also urged the international community to assist Syria in the implementation for the Convention and praised the destruction of its chemical weapons arsenal  which was implemented in a tight timeframe and under challenging conditions.  The total destruction of chemical weapons should remain a principle objective of that Convention  she said  adding that the objectives could be better achieved through the negotiation of multilateral agreements. On the Biological Weapons Convention  she said her delegation supported all efforts towards its universality  and emphasized that more needed to be on implementation of its article X. TOSHIO SANO (Japan) said it was essential to strengthen efforts to universalize the Chemical Weapons Convention and also to provide incentives  including expertise and technical assistance  to encourage States to join it.  His country participated in and supported the OPCW’s mock industry inspection in Myanmar in August  sharing its experiences as a State party  which received industry inspections daily.  It was important to destroy the Syrian chemical weapons materials and their production facilities as soon as possible.  Japan had contributed about $18 million to the United Nations and the OPCW for that effort.  The second report of the fact-finding mission concluded that activities contravening the Convention had been carried out repeatedly and systematically in Syria.  His delegation could not overlook such a serious issue. On the destruction of abandoned chemical weapons in China  he said Japan invested enormous human and financial resources in that unprecedented and extremely challenging undertaking  which could only be carried out through close cooperation and coordination with China.  Regarding the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention  he said its universalization had become more important than ever to enhance international security because advancement in life science not only brought enormous benefits but also could increase biological threats if misused.  In that connection  he welcomed Myanmar’s recent announcement of its intention to ratify the Convention. Ms. ABDULRAHMAN AL-THANI (Qatar)  associating with the Arab Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  said the issue of disarmament and non-proliferation was of great importance to the international community.  The previous decade had shown the dangers of weapons of mass destruction; the world could better learn from the experiences of the two World Wars  which resulted in millions victims.  To avoid those dangers  the international community had deployed tremendous efforts to “raise” international instruments.  The region to which her country belonged was full of political struggle  and the threat of weapons of mass destruction had motivated Qatar’s participation in any effort to remove the use or the threat of use of those weapons from the region and to strengthen international peace and security in the area.  The answer was not an arms race  but rather strong economies that could provide prosperity and a dignified life for the people. JEAN-HUGHES SIMON-MICHEL (France)  associating with the European Union  said the conclusions of the fact-finding mission that chlorine had been used “systemically and repeatedly” as a chemical weapon in Syria in 2014 were unequivocal.  It would be unacceptable for the perpetrators of those crimes to benefit from impunity  he said  adding that Syria must assure the international community that its chemical programme was completely and irreversibly dismantled by clarifying gaps in its initial declaration and destroying without delay its chemical weapons production facilities.  In this context  France supported the OPCW and called on States that had not yet done so to join the Convention. Within the framework of the Biological Weapons Convention  France had proposed setting up a peer-review mechanism.  That proposal aimed to increased trust and transparency between States parties  as well as the sharing of best practices regarding the treaty’s implementation.  On the issue of delivery systems of weapons of mass destruction  he said that missiles were an issue of concern that must be urgently addressed.  That said  the international community must step up its efforts to increase the effectiveness of multilateral agreements  particularly The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation and the Missile Technology Control Regime.  In that regard  France supported efforts towards the universalization of the Code. MIGUEL CAMILO RUIZ (Colombia) said that the weapons of mass destruction were not designed for self-defence  which was the reason why his country was a party to both the Chemical and Biological Weapons Conventions.  He praised the support of the European Union to establish a national authority in charge of ensuring their effective implementation.  He also acknowledged the support of the Regional Centre for Peace  Disarmament and Development in Latin America as well as that of the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs.  He called on States that had not yet joined the Convention on Chemical Weapons to do so as soon as possible.  He reiterated his country's support for the OPCW as well as for Security Council resolution 1540 (2004)  which completed the existing regime. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-23,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gadis3509.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Transferred and traded around the globe  “excessive accumulation and unregulated proliferation” of illicit small arms and light weapons led to devastating consequences  say speakers in the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) as thematic debate on conventional weapons continued. While the world was focussed primarily on weapons of mass destruction  the effect of conventional weapons was more insidious  causing more mass casualties and untold suffering around the world  said the representative of Kenya. Armed violence  he added  was a major impediment to surmounting the challenges of building a peaceful society capable of meeting development goals. The representative of Eritrea said that the excessive accumulation and unregulated proliferation of small arms and light weapons continued to perpetuate conflicts in many parts of Africa  rendering insecurity “intractable”.  The social  economic and political impacts of small arms and light weapons on African citizens  said the speaker  were “disproportionate  pervasive and long-lasting”  and responsible for death  displacement and abuse against women and children.  The representative of Botswana noted that terrorists and non-State actors were using those weapons to commit atrocities.  Referencing Security Council resolution 2178 (2014)  he said the destruction of surplus and forfeited weapons was a starting point for reducing stockpiles available for illicit circulation. Echoing those sentiments  the representative of Guatemala said that small arms and light weapons had devastated her region  which continued to suffer from violence and crime due  in part  to such arms.  The high costs associated with development made small arms and light weapons a multifaceted issue. With that  she said her country supported any efforts towards finding solutions to the connection between armed violence and development.  For Iran  the excessive production of arms by major producers was a matter of serious concern  and without addressing that issue  global efforts would hardly reach expectations.  A clear example was the “irresponsible” export of arms to the Middle East region  with flows of sophisticated weapons into that volatile region continuing unabated. Highlighting the threat of man-portable air defence systems was the representative of Israel who said that heightened concern in recent years was a reminder that those weapons must not be allowed to reach the hands of terrorists or non-State actors.  That issue warranted closer and more immediate examination. Cambodia’s land had been riddled with mines from decades of war that claimed lives and maimed victims  posing obstacles for cultivating farming and development  said its delegate.  To confront that issue at the global level  it had shared its experiences in mine clearance with other affected countries. Similarly  the representative of Thailand said his country was committed to the goal of a zero-victim and mine-free country  and had adopted a holistic and integrated approach to victim assistance.  Strong local community networks were central to empowering persons with disabilities through rehabilitation  he added. Drawing attention to the link between arms transfers and gender-based violence  the representative of Ireland said women were a powerful force for change in matters of disarmament and arms control.  Ireland supported an increase in the number of women in policymaking  planning and implementation processes related to disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control. During the meeting  draft resolutions were introduced on the Arms Trade Treaty  measures to promote trust on conventional weapons  and the Mine-Ban Convention. Also speaking were the representatives of Mexico  Jamaica  Singapore  Georgia  Bulgaria  Sweden  United Kingdom  Chile  Turkey  Argentina  the Russian Federation  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Ecuador  Algeria  Czech Republic  Mozambique  and Chad. The First Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. on 24 October to continue its thematic debate segment. Background The First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) met today to continue its thematic debate on conventional weapons. For more background  see Press Release GA/DIS/3497. Statements YANERIT MORGAN (Mexico) welcomed the coming entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty  which she said was “a historic step forward” as the first global effort to regulate the trade in conventional arms and establish a legal framework in their trade.  Given the interest of her Government in implementing it as soon as possible  Mexico would host the First Conference of States Parties in 2015.  Towards that end  her country would conduct the preparatory process  in a transparent and inclusive manner  and as Conference President  it would promote inclusive decisions for the Treaty’s effective and timely implementation. She said that international humanitarian law was the foundation for the protection of life  dignity and the integrity of civilians in armed conflict.  In that vein  she joined calls to prevent and eliminate the use of indiscriminate weapons  particularly in densely populated areas.  Turning to anti-personnel landmines  she said the Mine Ban Convention had not only managed to stigmatize those weapons  but had contributed to the destruction of more than 1 million of them.  That work had not been easy  she said  acknowledging the crucial role of Governments  United Nations specialized agencies and programmes  and civil society  Mexico was committed to the “great humanitarian mission” established by that Convention to move towards the total elimination of anti-personnel landmines  which would strengthen international humanitarian law and the human rights regime. Shorna Kay Richards (Jamaica)  associating with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  said the Arms Trade Treaty  which was borne of the concerted action of like-minded States and civil society  was of “singular importance”.  The Treaty had the potential to become a welcome “Christmas gift”  but only if efforts were made to implement it fully and ensure its universalization.  That required international cooperation in capacity‑building as well as the establishment of a secretariat.  Jamaica was in the process of implementing the Treaty in cooperation with countries and organizations.  On small arms and light weapons  she reiterated her country’s commitment to further engagement on various aspects concerning on the full and effective implementation of the Programme of Action on those weapons  and she commended the Organization of American States and the United Nations for their tremendous work in Jamaica. Foo Khee Loon (Singapore)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  expressed deep concern about the humanitarian  socioeconomic and security impact arising from the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.  Weapons’ illicit diversion contributed to armed conflict  displacements  organized crime and terrorism.  Moreover  they undermined peace  safety  security  stability and sustainable social and economic development.  In that regard  Singapore supported international efforts to combat the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons  including through the Programme of Action and the International Tracing Instrument.  The country had put in place strict legislation and penalties to regulate the manufacture  possession and transfer of firearms and hoped that all nations would make the necessary efforts to implement the existing mechanisms. Kaha Imnadze (Georgia)  expressed his country’s readiness to cooperate with other countries in full implementation of existing mechanisms and participation in all consultative processes.  Elaborating a structural framework and establishing a secretariat as a plenipotentiary body  among other things  were critical to the success of the Arms Trade Treaty.  The complementary nature of instruments established for peace and stability in the region meant that undermining a single one undermined them all.  A recent draft treaty between the Russian Federation and the “Republic of Abkhazia” represented a serious threat to the process of the de-escalation of Georgia-Russia relations. He urged the Russian Federation to refrain from signing the so-called treaty to avoid undermining the security and stability of the region and beyond. STEPHAN TAFROV (Bulgaria)  associating with the European Union  said that the Arms Trade Treaty was a major achievement for the international community  and noted that his country had been one of the 53 countries to have ratified it.  The instrument filled a “serious gap” in international law and  now  its universalization was crucial.  On small arms and light weapons  the Programme of Action framework was an appropriate forum through which to address new developments that could help curb the illicit trade in those weapons.  In that respect  Bulgaria looked forward to the 2015 meeting of governmental experts to consider the implications of recent developments in small arms and light weapons-related technologies  as tasked by the Outcome Document of the Fifth Biennial Meeting in June.  He was deeply concerned at the alleged use of anti-personnel mines by certain State parties to the Mine-Ban Convention and the alleged “landing” of such weapons on the territory of a State party by another. Ulf Lindell (Sweden)  associating with the European Union  said the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty was a landmark step towards establishing robust international standards.  The next step was its full implementation  he said  adding that the Treaty had a provision for addressing gender-based violence  on which countries needed to work.  An open and inclusive process whereby State parties and signatories played a significant role was essential for moving forward.  Sweden assured implementation assistance to State parties requesting such help.  On the Programme of Action  his country offered to share its experience.  In closing  he said  human beings should not delegate life-and-death decisions on the battlefield to machines.  In that context  he was referring to lethal autonomous weapons systems. ZEBIB GEBREKIDAN (Eritrea)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that the excessive accumulation and unregulated proliferation of small arms and light weapons continued to perpetuate conflicts in many parts of Africa  rendering insecurity intractable.  Their social  economic and political impact on African citizens was disproportionate  pervasive and long-lasting  and they were responsible for death  displacement  sexual violence and abuse against women and children.  As a country that had emerged from decades of war  Eritrea was deeply concerned about the negative consequences and proliferation of those weapons.  That said  she hailed the achievements made since the creation of the Regional Centre on Small Arms in the Great Lakes region  the Horn of Africa and bordering States  and global support for that mechanism could enhance world peace and security. Catherine POLLARD (United Kingdom)  associating with the European Union  said that as a proud leading advocate of the Arms Trade Treaty  his country had signed  ratified and was already implementing its provisions.  Priorities on that front were now two-fold.  First and foremost  his delegation would continue to promote the Treaty’s universalization and encourage full implementation once it entered into force.  The United Kingdom had allocated more than $1 million to support States in ratifying and provisionally implementing the Treaty. He urged the international community to support Libya in tackling weapons proliferation  which was destabilizing the country and wider region.  The Arms Trade Treaty could be part of the solution to control that proliferation.  This year  he said  had been a momentous one  and to that end  the United Kingdom was introducing resolution “L.32” marking the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty.  States must take the next step together  and with energy  whether by supporting the resolution or signing and ratifying the Treaty  ensure its effective implementation.  Moreover  each State  where possible  could assist other countries in that process.  By working together  the Treaty could and would make a difference in the lives of many. Vincente GARRIDO (Chile)  aligning with the Union of South American States (UNASUR)  said the Arms Trade Treaty represented the first significant effort to regulate an entire category of weapons that continued to wreak havoc around the world.  The Mine-Ban Convention was another crucial step in bolstering international humanitarian law  he said  stressing the importance of the United Nations Programme of Action as well.  The effective inclusion of women in relevant mechanisms was of utmost priority for the international community. Maria Soledad (Guatemala)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that small arms and light weapons had devastated her region.  Despite a long history of armed conflict  it had emerged as a region of peace  but it continued to suffer from violence and crime due  in part  to illicit arms.  For that reason  combatting illicit arms trafficking was a key priority for her Government.  The climate of insecurity and high costs associated with development made small arms and light weapons a multifaceted issue  she noted  adding that her country supported any efforts towards finding solutions to the link between armed violence and development.  She welcomed the Arms Trade Treaty; Guatemala had signed it and would soon complete the ratification process.  She also welcomed Mexico’s offer to host of the Treaty’s first review and supported the candidacy of Trinidad and Tobago as host of the Treaty’s secretariat. PATRICIA O’BRIEN (Ireland)  associating with the European Union  noted that women had been  and continue to be  a powerful force for change in matters of  disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control.  Women’s knowledge  experience and perceptions should be included  and their perspectives about security threats considered.  In that regard  she strongly supported efforts to increase the number of women active in policymaking  planning and implementation processes related to disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control.  Noting the link between international arms transfers and gender-based violence included in the Arms Trade Treaty  she encouraged States parties to fully implement all provisions.  Concerned about the use of cluster munitions in Syria this year and reports of use in Ukraine and South Sudan  she called upon all State and non-State actors to refrain from deploying those inhumane weapons.  The First Review Conference on the Convention on Cluster Munitions  to be held in Croatia in 2015  would be an opportunity to realize the aims of that instrument. Mehmet Ceylan (Turkey) said that the issue of Small Arms and Light Weapons could be taken from an international  regional and national security perspective  making it a disarmament issue  as well as from a human life and socio-economic perspective  thereby making it a humanitarian and development issue.  Turkey welcomed the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty and recalled that mitigating the risk of conventional weapons called for concerted global effort.  His country contributed to all efforts towards establishing effective norms aimed at eradicating illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.  Turkey supported the implementation of the Programme of Action and welcomed Security Council resolution 2117 (2013) on small arms and light weapons.  Turkey  committed to the implementation of the Mine-Ban Convention  participated in the third review conference and was a State party to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.  He welcomed the discussions on lethal autonomous weapons held in the context of meetings on the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.  His country shared the humanitarian goals of the Convention on Cluster Munitions and condemned their use against civilians.  Turkey believed that the most effective way to address the ill-effects of conventional weapons was to tackle the root cause of conflicts and the making efforts towards the peaceful settlement of disputes. GABRIELA Martinic (Argentina)  presenting a draft resolution  Implementation of measures to promote trust on conventional weapons on behalf of 60 delegations  said the text’s objective was to highlight recent developments in that area.  It was not prescriptive but voluntary in the interest of boosting trust and confidence.  She welcomed expressions of support for the text and urged countries that had not done so to join its sponsorship.  She sought its consensus approval. VLADIMIR ERMAKOV (Russian Federation) said that his delegation could perhaps also calmly speak  as others did  about the shortcomings and virtues of the Arms Trade Treaty  and the goals that the international community faced in the context of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and many other neutral topics.  However  he said he would not do so.  A particular reason for that was that a number of delegations allowed themselves to cast unfounded aspersions against Russia including in the context of quite tragic developments in Ukraine  a country that was dear to Russia in many respects. In response  he said he would like to draw attention  not to some kind of subjective assessments but to the unequivocal facts  he said.  After the Foreign Ministers of Germany  France and Poland signed last February the agreements on the settlement of the political situation in Ukraine  those agreements had been “completely broken” the very next day  and the United States together with the European Union supported the armed and anti-constitutional coup d’état in Ukraine  and helped the ultra-national forces to come to power in Kyiv that literally exploded the country from inside  thus turning the world upside down.  It was perhaps too early to make final conclusions  but on the whole those reprehensible events in the middle of Europe in the twenty-first century could have a greater impact on the world than the nuclear bombardment of Hiroshima and Nagasaki 70 years ago.  One thing was already clear  which was that the masks were off and the so-called Western (European) “democratic values” had been completely trampled by the West. Regarding conventional arms control  he said Russia fully shared the view that compliance with international humanitarian law was important.  However  he proposed not to discuss an abstract notion  but rather to make “an analysis of concrete facts”.  Russia had repeatedly expressed its serious concern in connection with the use by Kyiv of weapons with indiscriminate and extremely injurious effect to civilian populations.  These included the constant shelling of cities in south-eastern Ukraine by heavy artillery  ballistic missiles  and salvo-launch systems.  There had also been the use of tanks  air force  incendiary weapons  cluster munitions  and the massive extermination of civilians including women  elders  children  and the handicapped.  This was in addition to the destruction of infrastructure  all of which could not be described in any other way but as a gross violation of international humanitarian law and the basic human right to life.  In that light the use of anti-personnel mines in one’s own country  which was a direct violation of the Ottawa Treaty  seemed to be “just a routine detail”. His delegation was surprised not only by Kyiv’s “beastly actions”  but by attempts of the so-called “Western democracy” to sweep all these war crimes under the carpet.  Collective suppression of facts of blatant violations of international humanitarian law actually meant aiding and abetting the dark forces which continued still in total impunity to brutally massacre unarmed people.  He took note of some delegations’ arguments trying to lay the blame for their own actions at the door of Russia and said that would not work.  He said that Russia was not a party to the internal conflict in Ukraine.  But naturally  politically  the Russian Federation had insisted and would continue to insist on “a full ceasefire to the hostilities” in south-eastern Ukraine and the solution of all extremely complex issues through negotiations among the regional forces themselves in Ukraine. On the issue of conventional arms control in Europe  he said that for 17 years Russia had fully implemented its obligations under the old Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE)  even though that Treaty “was of a discriminatory nature” against Russia.  His country had ratified the new CFE  but since none of the European partners had followed suit  the Russian Federation was forced to introduce a moratorium on the implementation of its obligations in 2007.  Seven years had already passed but nothing had been done by Western partners and the situation continued to deteriorate.  The military bloc of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization continued to move closer to Russian borders.  For its part  he said the Russian Federation remained transparent in its military activities. MIRZA PAŠIĆ (Bosnia and Herzegovina)  associating with the European Union  said the globalization of the arms trade had allowed such transactions to proceed with little control.  The Arms Trade Treaty represented a significant step to reversing that trend  he said  adding that his country was committed to its full and effective implementation.  Bosnia and Herzegovina still faced threats posed by unexploded ordnance  dating from the war in the 1990s  and welcomed the support international partners assist in ameliorating that situation. Fernando Luque Marquez (Ecuador)  associating with UNASUR and the Non-Aligned Movement  reiterated his country’s total support for the Convention on Cluster Munitions and the Mine-Ban Convention.  Concerning small arms and light weapons  he underlined that the Programme of Action and the international tracing instruments were the main tools of action and that commitments should be met at the international  regional and national levels.  The international community should advance discussions on unmanned combat aerial vehicles  or UAVs  and lethal autonomous weapons  known as LAWS  as part of addressing new challenges arising in the field of conventional weapons.  Ecuador took full part in the Arms Trade Treaty negotiations on the belief that it could make an effective contribution to that growing global challenge.  Action should be based on the principles of universality and balance. ZAINA BENHABOUCHE (Algeria)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  as well as the Arab and African Groups  said the illicit weapons trade was a serious threat to stability  particularly in Africa.  The situations in Libya and the Sahel required international attention to reinforce the countries’ capabilities to confront that scourge.  For its part  Algeria had submitted its national report on the Programme of Action as well as on the International Tracing Instrument.  The Programme of Action had helped create a collective re-awakening  she said  adding that international and subregional cooperation was essential to secure effective border control and eradicate illicit arms flow.  Algeria had implemented national legislation and was promoting knowledge-sharing and training with neighbouring countries to develop their capabilities to contravene in illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons.  The country had also made efforts to eliminate anti-personnel landmines and believed the Mine-Ban Convention was the appropriate framework for dealing with that issue. VERONICA STROMSIKOVA (Czech Republic)  associating with the European Union  said her country considered the Arms Trade Treaty to be a milestone in the development of international standards to regulate the global conventional weapons trade  and welcomed its coming entry into force.  She reiterated her strong support for the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.  An important issue of the treaty’s agenda was LAWS  and her delegation saw the merit in continuing discussion on different aspects of those weapons.  She welcomed the substantial progress achieved at the Third Review Conference and also reiterated her support for the Convention on Cluster Munitions expressing deep concern over their reported use in Syria  South Sudan and Ukraine.  The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons affected regional and international security; she supported measures to strengthen cooperation in tracing illegal flows and believed that the Arms Trade treaty’s entry into force would help. ANTONIO GUMENDE (Mozambique)  associating with the African Group and Non-Aligned Movement  highlighted the illicit use of small weapons had widespread negative effects on peace and stability.  It was in that context that the country attached great importance to the implementation of the Programme of Action.  Mozambique continued to implement decisions and take initiatives at the national level on that important issue  he said  stressing that the United Nations should remain vigilant.  He introduced a draft resolution entitled Implementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on their Destruction  and sought full support of it. NKOLOI NKOLOI (Botswana)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and African Group  described peace and security as preconditions to the achievement of sustainable economic and social development.  He remained concerned over the illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons worldwide.  His delegation welcomed the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty aiming at curbing the uncontrolled arms trade and looked forward to its implementation.  Small arms and light weapons posed danger to communities  where terrorists and non-State actors used them to commit atrocities.  He welcomed the adoption of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) to tackle the threat of foreign and terrorist fighters.  He believed that the destruction of surplus and forfeited weapons was a starting point for reducing stockpiles available for illicit circulation.  He noted with satisfaction the convening of the Fifth Biennial Meeting on implementation of the Programme of Action  whose implementation remained critical.  Botswana had established an Inter-Agency responsible for its implementation and regional protocols aimed at addressing the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. Seyed Mohammad Ali ROBATJAZI (Iran)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that his country was at the forefront of the combat against terrorism  violent extremism and drug trafficking in the region.  As such  it had been actively engaged in curbing illicit small arms and light weapons flows and continued to support the full implementation of the Programme of Action and International Tracing Instrument.  The excessive production of arms by major producers with the aim of export to other countries was a matter of serious concern.  Without addressing that issue  global efforts to prevent trade would hardly achieve their expectations.  A clear example was the irresponsible export of arms to the Middle East region  yet flows of sophisticated weapons into that volatile region continued unabated.  Moreover  unlimited offensive weapons continued to be transferred to the Israeli regime  which fuelled that regime’s “war machine” and enabled its pursuit of expansionist  aggressive and destabilizing policies in the region. He said his country was also concerned about the irresponsible arms exports to certain countries in the Persian Gulf region.  According to public information  two countries in that region were among the five biggest arms importers in the world.  While Iran recognized the right of all States to acquire arms for their self-defence and security needs  such a large amount of imports were usually used in the intervention of the domestic affairs of other States.  On the Arms Trade Treaty  he said it made little sense that such an instrument had not prohibited arms transfers to countries that were engaged in committing acts of aggression  including foreign occupation  he said. KORAKOT PARACHASIT (Thailand)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  reiterated his commitment to the United Nations Programme of Action as the principal multilateral cooperation framework for addressing the common and widespread problem of small arms and light weapons.  For the Arms Trade Treaty to be truly effective  State parties  observers States and civil society must play their part in facilitating implementation.  Duplication of work or imposition of unnecessary burdens should be avoided.  Thailand strictly adhered to the humanitarian principles enshrined in various conventions  including the Convention on Cluster Munitions and the Mine-Ban Convention.  On mine clearance  Thailand was committed to the goal of a zero-victim and mine-free country and had adopted a holistic and integrated approach to victim assistance. Strong local community networks were central to empowering persons with disabilities through rehabilitation. ANDREW KIHURANI (Kenya)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and African Group  said that while the world was focussed on weapons of mass destruction  the effect of conventional weapons was “more insidious” and caused “mass casualties and untold suffering” around the world.  Conventional weapons proliferation  especially the illicit transfer  excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread and misuse of small arms and light weapons  posed  not only a significant threat to global peace and security  but also to social and economic development.  Armed violence was a major impediment to overcoming the challenges of building a peaceful society capable of meeting the Millennium Development Goals. Africa  she said  continued to be afflicted by armed conflict owing to the illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons.  The cause of the most fatalities worldwide  they had a destabilizing effect on development in the most fragile regions.  Kenya welcomed the adoption of Security Council resolution 2117 (2013) on small arms and light weapons.  She stressed the importance of effective implementation of the outcome of the Second Review Conference on the Programme of Action  and  noting that her Government had put in place legislative procedures for its implementation  including policies and national monitoring frameworks with the participation of civil society organizations.  Her delegation valued regional and international cooperation in the fight against the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons and cooperated with the Regional Centre in the Great Lakes region  the Horn of Africa and neighbouring States.  Kenya welcomed the Maputo plan of action.  In closing  she said the proliferation of small arms and light weapons in Kenya was the consequence of wider challenges facing her region such militant group’s acquisition of arms  YAUNG CHAN SOPHEA (Cambodia)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that his country’s land had been riddled with mines from decades of war that had claimed lives and maimed victims  posing obstacles for farming cultivation and development.  Cambodia and its development partners would continue to support mine-risk education programmes in the country and had shared experiences in mine clearance with other affected countries.  To contribute to that process in the Middle East and Africa  it had participated in United Nations Peacekeeping operations  deploying more than 2 000 peacekeepers to Lebanon  Mali and South Sudan.  In November  it would deploy another unit of 216 peacekeepers to the Central African Republic for United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission (MINUSCA). In its own region  ASEAN had been working towards establishing the Regional Mine Action Centre in Cambodia  and his country would organize a regional seminar on that body’s establishment  on 2 and 3 November.. AHMAT ABDERAMAN (Chad)  associating with the African Union and Non-Aligned Movement  said small arms and light weapons not only destabilized States but also undermined social and economic and development  thereby posing a threat to international peace and security.  Detailing Chad’s national programmes to reduce that threat  he called for effective implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty building on the momentum that had been generated. Michal SEHAYAK SOROKA (Israel) expressed deep concern regarding developments in the Middle East and beyond  where terrorist organizations and non-State actors had acquired  smuggled and possessed weapons that sometimes exceeded the arsenals acquired by sovereign States.  In this regard  it was worrying that terrorist organisations had at their disposal weapons such as short- and medium-range rockets and missiles  man-portable air defence systems  or MANPADS  unmanned aerial vehicles  or UAV’s  and shore-to-sea missiles.  Those weapons contributed to destabilizing the region and were used primarily against civilians.  Additionally  their proliferation threatened communities and sovereign States.  Countering that threat required resolve  cooperation  and a concerted effort by the international community.  An important basis already existed in Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1747 (2010)  she noted.She said her country considered the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons to be a paramount instrument in the regulation of the use of those weapons and in achieving the necessary balance between military needs and humanitarian considerations in the application of international humanitarian law.  Decisions undertaken in this forum had the distinct benefit of having a real and significant impact on the ground.  She went on to highlight the threat of MANPADS in recent years  saying those cases served as reminders that those weapons should not reach the hands of terrorists or non-State actors.  That issue warranted closer and more immediate examination  she said. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-23,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaspd565.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Data and information were “transformative” tools that could empower individuals  communities and societies  and bring all together to chart the direction for the future  the Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) heard today  as it concluded its discussion on questions relating to information. At the same time  sounding a note of caution  the representative of the Philippines said that the United Nations Department of Public Information should be mindful of the “global digital gap”  a sobering reality that underscored the continued importance of traditional media channels. The representative of Lesotho said the current period in human history was characterized by the evolution of rapid communications systems  with a growing use of information and communications technologies in all areas of life.  However  the development of those technologies remained highly uneven among countries. Voicing his appreciation for the volume of information on the website of the United Nations  the representative of Cameroon  however  said that the digital divide made information inaccessible to most populations. Strengthening that position  the representative of Bahrain said the Department should continue to pay attention to traditional media  recalling that the International Day of Broadcasting was a way to show the importance of traditional media. Another way to bridge the digital divide was to provide information in a transparent  equitable  and non-discriminatory way  based on the principle of parity  said the representative of Ecuador.  The Department should disseminate its work in all official languages  he added  in a sentiment that was echoed by several countries. Several speakers cited the importance and relevance of the services provided by the United Nations Information Centres.  The representative of Burkina Faso  for example  said that those played an important role in addressing country-specific issues.  They also provided real-time information to developing countries  added the representative of Myanmar. In brief concluding remarks  Maher Nasser  Acting Head of the Department of Public Information  speaking in Arabic  pledged to work with Member States to find solutions to issues and challenges raised  and to meet the hopes and aspirations expressed.  He urged Member States to continue working together in building a better United Nations for a better world. Also today  the Committee approved  without a vote  a draft decision on the “Question of Gibraltar”  and a draft resolution on “International Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space”  sending them to the General Assembly for adoption. Also speaking today were the representatives of Colombia  India  Algeria  Oman  El Salvador and Nigeria. The Committee will meet again at 3 p.m. Friday  24 October to begin its consideration of the effects of atomic radiation. Background The Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) met this afternoon to conclude its debate on questions relating to information.  Action on related draft resolutions A and B (document A/69/21) would be scheduled once the Secretariat has concluded its examination of the text.  Action was expected  however  on two drafts in connection with items on the Committee’s agenda. Action on Texts The Committee first turned its attention to a revised draft resolution  submitted under agenda item 49  entitled “International cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space” (document A/C.4/69/L.2/Rev.1). Acting without a vote  it approved L.2/Rev.1  which had been submitted by Algeria  in its capacity as Chair of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.  By the terms of the wide-ranging text  the General Assembly would endorse the report of the Outer Space Committee on the work of its fifty-seventh session; it would also agree that the Legal Subcommittee  at its fifty-fourth session  should continue substantive items and reconvene the working groups recommended by the Committee  taking into account the concerns of all countries  in particular those of developing countries. The Assembly would request the Outer Space Committee to continue to consider  as a matter of priority  ways and means of maintaining use of outer space for peaceful purposes. It would welcome the fact that the Outer Space Committee agreed  at its last session  to consider the broader perspective of space security and associated matters that would be instrumental in ensuring the safe and responsible conduct of space activities.  Also  it would identify effective tools that could potentially provide that Committee with new guidance. It would urge States that had not yet become parties to the international treaties governing the uses of outer space to consider ratifying or acceding to them  as well as incorporating them into their national legislation. In a related provision  the Assembly would urge all States  in particular those with major space capabilities  to contribute actively to the goal of preventing an arms race in outer space  as an essential condition for the promotion of international cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes. The committee then turned to the draft decision  submitted by the Chair  entitled Question of Gibraltar (document A/C.4/69/L.5)  approving it without a vote. That text would have the Assembly urge the Governments of Spain and the United Kingdom — while listening to the interests and aspirations of Gibraltar that are legitimate under international law — to reach  in the spirit of the Brussels Declaration of 27 November 1984  a definitive solution to the question of Gibraltar  in the light of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and applicable principles  and in the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. The Assembly would take note of the desire of the United Kingdom to continue with the trilateral Forum of Dialogue on Gibraltar.  It would also take note of the position of Spain that the Forum does not exist any longer  and should be replaced with a new mechanism for local cooperation  in the interest of the social well-being and regional economic development  in which the people of the Campo de Gibraltar and Gibraltar are represented. The Assembly would also take note of efforts made by both parties to resolve current problems and to engage in a flexible and responsive form of dialogue between all relevant and appropriate parties  on an informal  ad hoc basis  in order to find common solutions and make progress on issues of mutual benefit. Thematic Debate on Information DIANA LUCÍA RENGIFO (Colombia)  associating with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) and Group of Friends of Spanish  said modern technologies played an increasing role in disseminating information about the United Nations.  However  sections of the global population did not have access to such technology  and  therefore  the Department of Public Information should continue to pay attention to traditional media such as radio  television  and newspapers.  The United Nations Information Centres had conscientiously carried out their mission and should continually be supported. She said linguistic parity between the six official languages was also important  adding that substantial progress needed to be made in issuing daily press releases in all languages.  The mandate had been to seek creative solutions to achieve that objective  and the Department should proceed accordingly forthwith.  Although Spanish was the second  most-visited language on the United Nations website  content was limited.  Future reports from the Committee on Information should include disaggregated statistics that would provide greater clarity to help make appropriate decisions. SIMPLICE HONORÉ GUIBILA (Burkina Faso) saluted the quality of the work done by the Department and encouraged it to continue its efforts.  Information was a tool to help communities face the challenges of development.  With the advent of new technologies  communication diversified  which created a digital divide between the North and South.  His delegation was satisfied with the use of new technologies by the Department; however  he was preoccupied by the global disparities regarding access to information  and he asked the United Nations to narrow the divide by giving assistance to developing countries. His delegation  he said  was convinced of the importance of traditional media still broadly used in developing countries  and he urged the Department to continue to use both traditional and new media.  He also encouraged the Department to offer impartial  balanced  and up-to-date information through the United Nations Information Centres so as to sensitize public opinion about the Organization’s activities.  The Information Centres played an important role in addressing country-specific issues.  Burkina Faso condemned violence against journalists and called for the implementation of a mechanism to protect them.  His delegation also called on the Department to improve multilingualism in the United Nations system  and promote respect for the principal of parity in the official languages. KELEBONE MAOPE (Lesotho) said the current period in human history was characterized by the evolution of rapid communications systems  with a growing use of information and communications technologies in all areas of life.  However  the development of those technologies remained highly uneven among countries; that necessitated its management in a multilateral  transparent  and democratic way.  The United Nations could not afford to do business as it did in 1945  when it was formed.  For it to resonate with modern society  the Organization had to adapt to new methods of disseminating information in a globalized world.  And  in order to more effectively promote global awareness and greater understanding of the work of the United Nations  it must be fully resourced.  The Organization had to be closer to the people it served  more today than ever before.  It was in that spirit Lesotho had constructed an office complex in 1994 and donated it to the United Nations to house its country programmes  agencies  and Information Centre.  The Centre in Lesotho and elsewhere  must be strengthened to achieve its mission  and robust engagement with the host countries must be upheld.  Member States should be respected for who they were  and small nations must not be marginalized in favour of big ones. MAMOUDOU MANA (Cameroon) advocated for the promotion of freedom of information and access to knowledge  as an aid to peace and development.  Broader access to science and information and communications technologies in his country had received the Government’s help.  Cameroon had undertaken a broad programme to construct television centres  aimed at improving access to the Internet in rural communities and encourage the effort to reduce the digital divide.  He expressed  appreciation for the Department’s efforts to ensure that the information society truly became a global village.  His delegation welcomed  in particular  the Department’s dissemination of impartial information  in sharing the goals and ideals of the United Nations.  Information  however  should be available in real time for everyone.  For that to happen  equal treatment of information in all United Nations languages and online services was necessary. He voiced appreciation for the volume of online information  but recalled that the digital divide made it inaccessible to most populations.  Print publication for a large population was the only way to spread credible information and  in that regard  he paid tribute to the work of the United Nations Information Centres and their multidimensional mission.  His country hosted a Centre  which enabled journalists  authorities  civil society  students and researchers to have access to a reliable source of information.  The Centres must have staff and programmes to carry out their mission  and he asked the Department to take appropriate measures for that to occur. V. SRINIVAS PRASAD (India) expressed full support for the Department’s work in promoting and advancing the goals of the United Nations through campaigns on issues of importance to the international community.  Specifically  India appreciated the United Nations Academic Impact programme  which supported the work of educational institutions around the world.  In that context  he recognized the Department’s Holocaust Outreach Programme as an educational initiative to prevent future genocides.  His country was also pleased with the Department’s initiative on the Transatlantic Slave Trade  a programme that recognized the brutality of the trade while  at the same time  paying tribute to the resilience of the victims.  Another project of note was the “Music for Peace” event.  Looking ahead  India would like to see more collaboration between the departments of Public Information  Peacekeeping Operations  and Field Support  to showcase success stories and highlight activities of United Nations peacekeepers in strife-torn areas.  India was also pleased with United Nations radio programmes in Hindi and Urdu.  Further engagement and focus on South Asia was still needed  given the region’s significant contribution to the Organisation’s peacekeeping efforts. XAVIER LASSO MENDOZA (Ecuador)  associating with CELAC and Group of Friends of Spanish  said it was the constitutional duty of States to promote universal access to information and communications technologies.  Another way to bridge the digital divide was to provide information in a transparent  equitable  and non-discriminatory way.  It was the right — as well as the need — of the international community to know what the Organization was doing.  Based on the principle of parity  the Department should disseminate its work in all official languages  and budgetary constraints should not be used as a pretext for inaction.  The guiding principle of multilingualism was based on facts  he said  reiterating that Spanish was the second most widely used language.  Currently  vast sections of the world’s populations were being excluded from enjoying the rights of parity and equity.  A dissemination strategy based on one language was inconsistent with the principles and ideals of the United Nations  he said  urging the Organization to engage with States to redress the disparity.  In closing  he said States must not violate international laws governing information on the pretext of security  through such acts as surveillance. LIBRAN N. CABACTULAN (Philippines)  aligning with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  said that data and information were “transformative” tools that could empower individuals  communities  and societies.  They helped everyone better understand the past  draw lessons from the present  and bring all together to chart the direction for the future.  However  data and information could be used for exactly the opposite reasons.  They could misinform individuals  generate divisions  and foster hatred around the world.  In that context  credible institutions were critical in providing accurate  timely  and reliable information. Towards that end  he said  the Department actively fed into a global information system aimed at achieving a more peaceful  progressive  and prosperous world.  He commended its accomplishments and activities  noting that countless documents  records  photos  and videos were readily available online.  Still  certain areas required attention.  While efforts should be sustained to develop its capabilities  the Department should be mindful of the “global digital gap”  a sobering reality that underscored the enduring importance of traditional media channels.  He also highlighted the need for the Department to play a more meaningful role in the global understanding of pressing issues such as Ebola. FAISAL AL ZAYANI (Bahrain) said the Department became a mirror that reflected the diverse activities of the United Nations  and no efforts should be spared in reporting them.  The United Nations was the only forum to take collective decisions on issues facing the international community  and the Department communicated broadly with the public in that respect.  In particular  the Department had a central role in promoting sustainable development and climate change.  The Information Centres were essential in sensitizing the public about International Days; they were the voice of the United Nations to the public. Although technological innovation was welcome  he said  traditional media was still important to developing countries.  Promotion of the International Day of Broadcasting showed the importance of traditional means of communication  which was the best way to attract the public and offer easy access to information.  In order for the Department to fulfil its mission  there must be parity among the six languages of the United Nations.  Also essential was to work towards reducing — if not eliminating — the digital divide.  Apart from that  the Department had succeeded fully in all its activities.  His delegation thanked it for covering issues concerning the question of Palestine  and looked forward to the continuation of those activities until a fair solution was found. KYAW MYO HTUT (Myanmar)  associating with ASEAN  said that the Department’s work had become even more relevant as Member States pushed for the post-2015 development agenda  and ushered in a year of action on many challenging global issues.  Information sharing between the United Nations and Member States would go a long way towards making informed policy decisions.  Closer cooperation between the Department  client departments  and field offices would facilitate more effective and targeted delivery of information.  The Information Centres played an important role in providing real-time information to developing countries.  Through information technology  those Centres should extend their outreach to rural areas.  In a similar vein  his Government was trying to promote an “e-Government” system using information and communications technologies to rapidly bring efficient public service and benefits to citizens.  As part of a wide range of Government- initiated reforms  media freedom had been recognized as one of its most visible achievements.  The country had abolished press censorship in 2012  but still faced challenges in ensuring that those new freedoms were used in a responsible and accountable manner  he said. MOURAD MEBARKI (Algeria) stressed the role played by United Nations radio  television  and print publications  which were indispensable avenues of communication.  Algeria also recognized the growing role of new media platforms  but emphasized the urgency of ensuring they were used in accordance with United Nations policies.  The Department should promote the causes espoused by the Organization since its founding  as well as the priorities that evolved over time.  The Department’s activities aimed at raising awareness of the Palestine question should be guided by the international quest for a two-State solution.  More energetic work was needed to establish parity in the use of all six languages in disseminating information about the Organization. Ms. AL-HAJRI (Oman) expressed her appreciation to the Department.  Mass media was the mirror that reflected events in all countries.  There was no doubt that intellectual diversity was a characteristic of this Organization.  Her delegation stressed the importance of using new technology to promote all activities  as that paved the way to reach out to new groups such as the youth.  Providing assistance to developing countries to narrow the digital gap was very important.  She supported the call made by other delegations to double the efforts to provide support to developing countries in the field of information.  She thanked the Department for its efforts in disseminating information  and raising awareness about the Organization’s activities among the public at large. RUBÉN IGNACIO ZAMORA RIVAS (El Salvador)  associating with CELAC and the Group of Friends of Spanish  stressed the need for measures to ensure the use of information and communications technologies in a reliable  secure  and orderly way.  Such initiatives should have clear operational mechanisms and frameworks for evaluation  and they should respect national sovereignty  equality  non-interference in internal affairs  democracy and human rights.  He emphasized the importance of the Committee on Information in the establishment of a new  equitable  and just international information order.  He firmly supported calls to ensure multilingualism in the dissemination of the Organization’s work. ANTHONY BOSAH (Nigeria) commended the Department’s efforts in supporting the public information components of United Nations peacekeeping and special missions in developing communication and information policies that promoted a “culture of peace”.  The task of reaching out to a global audience  in different languages  was indeed a challenging one  he acknowledged.  He endorsed the use of social media and other relevant forms of information technology for raising awareness of the work of the United Nations.  In that context  the advancement of information technology had broadened the landscape for the transmission of information  and provided outlets for dissemination to a wide range of people  communities  and cultures.  However  those systems were still rudimentary in some developing nations.  That said  there was a need for continued use of traditional media in developing nations  particularly in Africa.  In the spirit of balanced reporting  Nigeria supported the view that United Nations journals  publications  and press releases be produced in all six official languages  and he advocated for greater use of local languages.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-23,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gashc4109.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. When using mass surveillance tactics to combat terrorism  it was imperative that States complied with international human rights law  the Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) heard today during interactive debates with experts as it continued its discussion on the protection and promotion of human rights and approving draft resolutions on literacy and crime prevention. Acting without a vote  the Committee adopted two draft resolutions on the rule of law  crime prevention and criminal justice in the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015 (document A/C.3/69/L.6) and the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (document A/C.3/69/L.17/Rev.1) respectively.  The Committee also adopted a draft resolution on literacy for life (A/C.3/69/L.9/Rev.1)  without a vote. Delegates also heard presentations by seven United Nations experts  who outlined the progress they had made and the challenges they faced in a wide range of human rights fields  from freedom of religion to government surveillance strategies.  Among emerging concerns was the issue of mass surveillance  said Ben Emmerson  Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism. The dynamic pace of technological change had enabled some States to secure bulk access to communications and content data  he said.  Law enforcement agencies of those States could potentially open for inspection the communications of “literally every Internet user”.  While combating terrorism was a public interest imperative  he cautioned  intelligence agencies must comply with international human rights law. On a related topic  David Kaye  Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression  called for further work on the intersection of surveillance  privacy and expression.  “Are we all adequately informed about the vulnerability of our expression online?” he asked.  Calling on States to protect children’s freedom of expression on the Internet while protecting them from harm  he emphasized that “today  to be disconnected from the net is to be silenced.”  It was also necessary for human rights defenders to be appropriately trained in the tools to protect themselves from surveillance. Speaking about those fighting to protect rights  Michel Forst  Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders  drew attention to the enormous risks faced by those working to promote women’s rights and to protect economic  social and cultural rights  the rights of minorities  lesbian  gay  bisexual  transgender and intersex persons and environmental activists and those working on issues of business and human rights. Also making presentations were Heiner Bielefeldt  Special Rapporteur on the freedom of religion or belief; Pablo de Greiff  Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth  justice  reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence; Tamara Kunanayakam  Chair of the Working Group on the Right to Development; and Gabriela Knaul  Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers  who said rule of law and access to justice concepts needed to be integrated in the new post-2015 development framework  emphasizing that “development needs justice. There is no way around it.” The Committee also heard the introduction of four draft resolutions related to the advancement of women  and three draft texts on the protection of children’s rights  international drug control and crime prevention and criminal justice. Participating in today’s interactive dialogues were speakers representing Norway  Liechtenstein  Russian Federation  United Kingdom  Czech Republic  Lithuania  Ireland  Switzerland  Cuba  Belarus  United States  Morocco  Mauritania  Netherlands  Indonesia  Ecuador  Qatar  Kenya  Tunisia  China  Germany  Brazil  Iraq  Argentina  Azerbaijan  France  Senegal  Philippines  Burkina Faso  Canada  Italy  Mexico  Malawi  Egypt  Iran  Syria  South Africa  Bahrain  Maldives  Latvia  Ethiopia  Israel  Austria and United Arab Emirates  as well as the European Union delegation. The Third Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Friday  24 October  to continue its general discussion on the protection and promotion of human rights. Background The Third Committee met this morning to continue its consideration of the protection and promotion of human rights.  It was also expected to take action on three draft resolutions: one on social development  Literacy for Life: shaping future agendas (document A/C.3/69/L.9/Rev.1); and two on crime prevention  Rule of law  crime prevention and criminal justice in the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015 (document A/C.3/69/L.6) and United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (document A/C.3/69/L.17/Rev.1.).  For background  see Press Release GA/SHC/4108 of 22 October. Interactive Debate MICHEL FORST  Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders  welcomed the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to two rights activists  Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi.  Turning to his report  he emphasized that his mandate should remain focused on the protection of human rights defenders most exposed or at risk  including those working to promote women’s rights  and to protect economic  social and cultural rights  the rights of minorities  lesbian  gay  bisexual  transgender and intersex persons and environmental activists and those working on issues of business and human rights. Since challenges facing human rights defenders did not take place in isolation and were often accompanied by unwarranted restrictions on activists’ rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association  he welcomed a strengthened cooperation and greater synergy with other special rapporteurs with the thematic mandates.  Turning to the issue of documenting individual cases of rights infringements  he said they were at the cornerstone of his mandate.  Yet he considered it crucial to also demonstrate good practices that could be duplicated and shared with other countries and regions. “I aim to strike a balance between exposing violations and showcasing good practices that can have a multiplier effect on the protection and promotion of the right to defend human rights ” he added.  He also expressed his concern over the increasing number of acts of intimidation and reprisals against human rights defenders in connection with their engagement with United Nations human rights mechanisms or regional organizations. In the ensuing interactive dialogue  delegates asked questions about the use of innovative technologies to enhance the work of human rights defenders  country visits  gender mainstreaming and information needed to identify laws and practices aimed at restricting areas in which civil society operated.  Other questions included how to combat reprisal and impunity  issues related to extractive industries and means to avoid duplication with other mandate holders. Mr. FORST expressed his desire to enhance the use of innovative instruments  including social networks  to help to ensure good communication between stakeholders and human rights defenders  as well as regular exchanges and sharing of information.  With regard to country visits  he renewed his call on Member States to issue invitations  as his predecessor was able to visit only 22 countries.  Turning to technical cooperation with other mandate holders  he discussed several upcoming engagements with his colleagues from regional commissions aimed at exchanging common views  ensuring synergies and avoiding duplications. Participating in the interactive dialogue were representatives of Norway  Liechtenstein  Russian Federation  United Kingdom  Czech Republic  Lithuania  Ireland  Switzerland  Cuba  Belarus  United States  Morocco  Mauritania  Netherlands  Indonesia and Ecuador  as well as the European Union delegation. GABRIELA KNAUL  Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers  introduced her report  which included details on country visits.  The Millennium Development Goals had represented a unique effort to reduce poverty by setting a series of time-bound targets and indicators.  Despite successful achievements  the development framework was too limited to fully account for the human experience of development.  Also  the Goals were silent on the devastating effects of conflict  violence  injustice and discrimination.  Noting that the rule of law and development were mutually reinforcing concepts  she underlined that the promotion of justice and the consolidation of the rule of law fostered more equitable  inclusive and sustainable development. Turning to the post-2015 development agenda  she said the concepts of the rule of law and access to justice needed to be integrated in the new framework.  Undoubtedly  access to justice was an essential component of the rule of law and  consequently  paramount to the development and construction of sustainable goals in the post-2015 agenda.  In that regard  fair and effective justice systems constituted the most efficient way to ensure a sense of safety  stability and prosperity.  In addition  she discussed the connection between sustainable development and the rule of law and human rights.  The issues related to access to justice and justice administration should be at the centre of the development agenda  she said.  Indeed  that was essential to break the vicious circle of poverty  exclusion and vulnerability.  Concluding  she said failing to acknowledge the role of the justice system and international legal obligations would jeopardize the success of the post-2015 agenda.  “Development needs justice ” she said.  “There is no way around it.” In the ensuing dialogue  delegates asked questions and made comments about access to justice  mechanisms to monitor justice systems  means to strengthen the rule of law and independent judiciaries. Ms. KNAUL  replying to questions about the rule of law  stressed that there was a direct and intrinsic connection between sustainable development and the rule of law and human rights.  The rule of law was a legal and political order based on the values of human rights  she said  adding that it was also a process to achieve development outcomes.  Free and equal access to judicial systems  including national human rights commissions and mediation institutions  must be the indicators of access to justice  which was an essential component of the rule of law.  In cases of failure to provide access  Member States would face serious consequences including corruption  impunity  lack of accountability  destruction of the rule of law and a reversal of development progress.  Furthermore  she emphasized that the United Nations had guidance on measuring the rule of law and human rights  which could be applied to any legal system in the world.  Echoing a statement made by a delegate of Kenya  she said States should maintain their impartiality and integrity to ensure an independent judiciary.  Finally  the independence of the justice system had a central role to play to enforce the rule of law. Also participating in the interactive dialogue were representatives of Qatar  Kenya  United States  Tunisia and Ecuador  as well as the European Union delegation. BEN EMMERSON  Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism  said that mass surveillance of the Internet posed a direct challenge to international law.  Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights included an obligation to respect the privacy and security of digital communications.  However  the dynamic pace of technological change had enabled some States to secure bulk access to communications and content data without prior suspicion. As a result  the communications of “literally every Internet user” were potentially open for inspection by intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the States concerned.  While the prevention and suppression of terrorism was a public interest imperative of the highest importance  intelligence agencies must still comply with international human rights law.  Merely to assert that mass surveillance technology could contribute to the suppression of terrorism failed to provide an adequate human rights law justification for its use  he said.  The fact that something was technically feasible and that it may sometimes yield useful intelligence  did not mean that it was either reasonable or lawful  he cautioned. States engaging in mass digital surveillance  he added  had so far failed to provide an evidence-based public justification for its necessity.  Therefore  he recommended that States should revise and update domestic legislation to ensure consistency with international human rights law.  A public legislative process would provide an opportunity for Governments to be transparent and would enable the public to appreciate the balance between privacy and security. In the interactive dialogue following his presentation  delegates posed questions about surveillance-related issues  including a legislative process to deal with it  evidence-based justifications  measures needed at the national level to prevent its improper use and tools  including studies and analysis  to assist those involved in combating terrorism.  Additional questions were posed in relation to possible remedies to online privacy rights violations and the responsibility of private companies in providing related services. Mr. EMMERSON said the absence of precise legislation created an environment that could allow interferences with the right to privacy.  Explicit and detailed laws were the only means to ensure legality  he added  as well as to enable individuals to foresee when the surveillance was taking place.  He said only a public legislative process would suffice  as it would force Governments to justify mass surveillance to the public  and allow the public to make informed choices.  Turning to the issue of how the extraterritorial surveillance dimension could be addressed by the international community  he said a non-discrimination obligation in Article 27 of the Covenant required States using that technology to ensure equal protection to national and non-national individual rights  inside and outside its jurisdiction.  The international convention was applied extraterritorially  he added. With regard to evidence-based justifications  he said it was not sufficient to give general and vague reasons about the duty to protect against terrorism.  Instead  they should provide detailed accounts of the tangible results it was trying to reach.  Public discussions to evaluate issues of intrusion were essential  he added  and that the threshold test would be that mass surveillance could be compatible on the basis of counter-terrorism justification.  Turning to the United Nations role in promoting the debate and developing safeguards compatible with the Covenant  he urged States to promote specific resolution action at the General Assembly level so the issue remained at the top of the agenda.  He also called for an update on general comments on the right to privacy  as it had been drafted long before the emergence of today’s information communication technologies.  He reaffirmed his support for the adoption by the Human Rights Council of a new special procedure mandate specifically addressing the right to privacy  as the topic was capable of falling into areas covered by other mandates.  In closing  he said that the right to privacy should not be a component in other areas  but rather have its own mandate. Also participating in the dialogue were representatives of Switzerland  Liechtenstein  China  Germany  United Kingdom  Brazil  Russian Federation  Iraq and Ecuador  as well as the European Union delegation. PABLO DE GREIFF  Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth  justice  reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence  said that most victims of gross violations of human rights and serious violations of international humanitarian law still did not receive any reparations.  The implementation gap not only affected victims directly  but also rippled across generations and entire societies  burdening them with legacies of mistrust and institutional weaknesses.  Even where reparations programmes had been established  they fell significantly short. While some countries  he added  with relatively wealthy economies had established programmes that were not particularly munificent  other countries with comparatively smaller economies had established programmes that distributed relatively large benefits.  Therefore  economic factors alone did not explain either the existence of a reparation programme or the magnitude of the benefits it distributed.  Suspiciously  most Governments who claimed that reparations were unaffordable did so before any such effort had been undertaken  “laying bare their unwillingness to take seriously what is in fact a matter of legal obligation”. Urging States to place human rights at the centre of reparation programmes  he stressed that there was much room for improvements in enabling women’s access to such services.  Too few victims of gender-related violations received any reparation and  when programmes existed  those tended to mainly concentrate on sexually-based violations.  Further  victims and human rights defenders continued to be at risk in most countries in transition.  Concluding  he urged Member States to protect the life and well-being of those who were seeking their right to reparation. In the ensuing dialogue  delegates inquired about best practices and cooperation to raise awareness in reparations for victims  effective reparation  the role of civil society  human rights based-approaches  investigation of crimes  and suggestions for negotiations vis-à-vis States. Mr. DE GREIFF  thanking the Governments of Uganda and Germany for hosting regional consultations  emphasized a comprehensive approach that linked justice and guarantees of non-recurrence.  One of the weaknesses of each measure  he noted  was the gap between the normative level and practical experiences in the area of reparations.  The weaknesses  in that regard  affected victims directly and burdened them with legacies of unredeemed mistrust  and frail notions and practices of citizenship.  That was why it was essential to include reparation programmes in the post-2015 development agenda discussions.  In addition  he said  there was no guarantee that each and every victim of conflict received the same benefit  which caused serious practical consequences.  On gender-related violence  he stressed that very few victims received any reparation  and when they did  reparations mainly concentrated on sexually-based violations limited to rape.  Concluding  he urged States to implement more comprehensive programmes to enhance access for women. Also participating in the interactive dialogue were representatives of Argentina  China  Norway  Germany  Switzerland  Brazil and Azerbaijan  as well as the European Union delegation. Introduction of Draft Resolutions A representative of France introduced a draft resolution on the Intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls (document A/C.3/69/L.19). A representative of Senegal then introduced a draft resolution on the Intensification of efforts to end obstetric fistula (document A/C.3/69/L.20). Next  representatives of the Philippines and Burkina Faso introduced draft resolutions on Trafficking in women and girls and Intensifying global efforts for the elimination of female genital mutilations (documents A/C.3/69/L.21 and A/C.3/69/L.22  respectively). The draft resolution on Child  early and forced marriage (document A/C.3/69/L.23) was then introduced by the representative of Canada. A representative of Italy then introduced a draft resolution on Strengthening the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme  in particular its technical cooperation capacity (document A/C.3/69/L.16)  and a representative of Mexico introduced a draft on International cooperation against the world drug problem (document A/C.3/69/L.15). Action on Texts The Committee approved a draft resolution on Literacy for life: shaping future agendas (A/C.3/69/L.9/Rev.1)  without a vote. Also without a vote  the Committee approved two draft resolutions relating to crime prevention and criminal justice.  First  it approved the text on the Rule of law  crime prevention and criminal justice in the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015 (document A/C.3/69/L.6) without a vote. Speaking in explanation of vote after the vote  a representative of Brazil said that her delegation reiterated that the report of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development was the main basis for the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda. Next  the Committee approved a draft text on the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (document A/C.3/69/L.17/Rev.1. After the vote  a representative of Malawi  speaking on behalf of the African Group  said that she hoped there would be more co-sponsor support for the resolution. A representative of Egypt  raising a point of order  said that the right procedures were not followed in the morning and the representatives of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates were not allowed to exercise a right of reply to the reports made.  He requested that those delegates be allowed to make their interventions. The Chair declined that request  saying that the agenda of the afternoon included three presentations. TAMARA KUNANAYAKAM  Chair of the Working Group on the Right to Development  recalled concerns in relation to the creation of an enabling international environment  including the need to promote the democratization of the system of international governance to increase the participation of developing countries in decision-making processes.  Other concerns were related to the need to promote effective partnerships with developing countries  especially with least developed countries  as well as the need to mainstream the right to development in the policies and operational activities of the United Nations.  Detailed proposals for draft operational sub-criteria were made under the attributes of participatory human rights processes  she said  including proposals on global good governance  the removal of inequities in global decision-making and the reform of international institutions.  Regarding the creation of a favourable economic environment at international levels  she noted that proposals were made on the removal of asymmetries in global trade  the elimination of tax havens and the elimination of debt. On the Declaration of the Right to Development  she emphasized that its realization would require a synergy in actions from a variety of actors.  Recalling the upcoming thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration  she hoped it would inspire Member States to move forward with a sense of urgency that the current global situation demanded to confront and eliminate the obstacles standing in the way of development  as well as to translate commitments into concrete actions  creating the conditions for the enjoyment of the inalienable right to development for all peoples.  During the interactive dialogue  questions were asked about measures that would ensure that a human rights perspective was incorporated in the post-2015 development agenda  as well as challenges to establish a legally binding instrument.  Additional questions addressed repercussions of unilateral economic sanctions undermining the right to development and measures to translate the right to development from theory into practice. Ms. KUNANAYAKAM said regarding the post-2015 development agenda  “we live in a globalized and interdependent world where a situation in one country affects the other”.  Hence  the development of one country was both important and of interest to others.  Levelling the political playing field was also important  she added  to ensure that everyone could participate. On obstacles faced by the Working Group in its work  she noted the absence of mechanisms to channel information on efforts taken at the national  regional and international levels.  Another obstacle was the insufficient participation of the United Nations in its work  she said  encouraging the Organization to be more active  as well as seek synergy between activities carried out in Geneva and in New York.  The last obstacle she discussed was the need for additional time for the Working Group to complete its work  as the five days allocated were not sufficient. Moving forward  she identified a need to prepare a framework to improve the efficiency of the Working Group  as well as the use of innovative methodologies and procedures to ensure a participatory process.  She hoped to draw inspiration from the sustainable development goals as they had benefited from structured inputs from the United Nations  calling on the Member States to ensure synergies were developed from different and complementary processes. Also participating in the debate were representatives of Iran  Syria  Cuba  Morocco  China and South Africa. DAVID KAYE  Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression  introduced his predecessor’s report  which focused on the rights of expression enjoyed by children.  He said the exercise of the right to expression implicated the ability of individuals and societies to climb out of poverty and the ability of journalists to bring the world’s attention to the stories of conflict  political unrest and disease.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights did not state that the right to freedom of expression was enjoyed only by adults  he emphasized  adding that “children are not mini-human beings with mini-human rights”.  Too little had been done to give the right to freedom and opinion to children.  As communications technologies evolved  some States had adopted disproportionate restrictions on freedom of expression  particularly on the Internet  he continued.  Turning to the goals for his mandate over the upcoming term  he said he would provide a detailed introduction of his objectives and methodologies during the twenty-ninth session of the Human Rights Council.  He said he would maintain and build upon successful efforts already undertaken by his predecessor.  Further  he said he would focus on protecting the expression of members of vulnerable groups  advancing the right to seek  impart and receive information and ensuring freedom of expression on the Internet.  “Today  to be disconnected from the net is to be silenced ” he said. Also highlighting the chilling effect of communications surveillance on the exercise of the freedom of expression  he called for further work on the intersection of surveillance  privacy and expression.  Legitimate law enforcement and national security measures must not undermine the exercise of freedom of expression.  It was necessary to study how technologies and laws were changing to strengthen surveillance and undermine technology. “Are we all adequately informed about the vulnerability of our expression online and on the tools to increase our protection?” he asked  calling for human rights defenders to appropriately be trained in the tools needed to protect themselves from surveillance.  Concluding  he looked forward to working with all Governments to foster compliance and build capacity to implement the norms. In the dialogue that followed  delegates asked questions about developing children’s critical thinking  empowering them online while protecting them and the fine line between use and abuse of freedom of expression  particularly in social media. Responding to questions about how best to strike a balance with freedom of expression  Mr. KAYE said that his approach was to focus on the law  particularly Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Any restrictions on freedom of expression must be proportionate and narrowly tailored so that they did not impinge on the right.  Regarding children’s freedom of expression online  he said that it was crucial to ensure that children had age-appropriate access and could develop their own critical thinking while being protected from harm. Participating in the interactive dialogue were representatives of Switzerland  Bahrain  Norway  United Kingdom  Maldives  Russian Federation  Lithuania  United States  Syria  Latvia  Cuba and Ethiopia  as well as the European Union delegation. HEINER BIELEFELDT  Special Rapporteur on the freedom of religion or belief  introduced his interim report  which focused on discrimination in the workplace and the responsibility of the State and other stakeholders to eliminate such practices.  The issue of religious intolerance and discrimination within employment had so far been largely underexplored.  While religious manifestations at the workplace did not cause major problems  there were serious examples of resistance  confrontation and intolerance.  In that regard  conflicts had resulted in employee dismissals or in other forms of sanctions and litigation. Turning to acts of intolerance and discrimination in the workplace  he noted that combating discrimination required a comprehensive approach of tackling both direct and indirect forms of discrimination based on religion and belief.  At the level of companies or other employing institutions  he said  a culture of trustful and respectful communication was needed to identify the specific needs of persons belonging to religious or belief minorities.  Despite positive experiences and measures of reasonable accommodation  he emphasized that people were still met with scepticism or resistance.  In that regard  States had a formal responsibility to eliminate intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief  including in the workplace. In the ensuing dialogue  delegates asked questions and made comments about freedom of religion or belief  successful examples in reversing intolerance  key areas to improve  protection of rights without limiting individuals  reasonable accommodation and professional support in combating discrimination  Human Rights Council resolution 16/18 and the role of international organizations and the private sector to tackle discrimination and extremism. Mr. BIELEFELDT  replying to questions about freedom of religion or belief  stressed that a Jewish piano teacher who was fired from her job was the reason why he prepared the report.  Turning to the question of male circumcision as a religious practice  he emphasized that it should not be confused with female genital mutilation. Underlining that freedom of expression could create a resource for combating hatred and extremism  he said there must be creative measures to tackle religious intolerance.  In that regard  in Sierra Leone  interreligious cooperation and communication between Muslims and Christians had a spillover impact in the workplace.  On the question of the role of international organizations  private sector and trade unions  he stressed that freedom of religion or belief should be a priority for everybody.  In addition  he said nobody can be immune from the issue as there was room for improvement.  On the question of resolution 16/18  he said it was a turning point for important issues.  Concluding  he said his next report would focus on the violence committed in the name of religion. Also participating in the interactive dialogue were representatives of Israel  Ireland  Canada  Germany  Austria  Netherlands  United Arab Emirates  United States  Norway and United Kingdom  as well as the European Union delegation. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-23,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaef3405.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The current global financial and economic crisis undermined development in the least developed countries  many of which continued to “lag in meeting most of the internationally agreed development goals”  Bolivia’s representative told the Second Committee (Economic and Financial) today as delegates met to discuss groups of countries in special situations. She emphasized the need for the full implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2020  and supported initiatives that would enable them to reach the stage of graduation. Several other delegates also called for intensified efforts to implement the commitments made in the Istanbul Programme of Action.  The Sudan’s representative said that the Programme’s objectives could be met if economies worked together to mitigate the effects of climate change  provide decent job opportunities  and improve health  education and technology transfer. Least developed countries faced many challenges.  According to Haiti’s representative  less than a third of those countries’ populations had access to electricity  and their trade rates had decreased in 2012.  On the other hand  there was a considerable increase in foreign direct investment to those countries over the 2011-2013 period compared to the 2001-2003 period. On the same issue  Nepal’s representative noted that most least developed countries were off-track on the Millennium Development Goals  and 46.2 per cent of their people remained in extreme poverty.  The plight of countries in special situations had been diagnosed  treatment plans made  and responsibilities allocated  but the actual treatment was “progressing sluggishly”. Speaking for a country which had graduated from the least developed status  the representative of Maldives noted that the graduation process was “far from smooth” and a recipe to shape future transitions adequately was yet to be found.  After graduation  the official development assistance (ODA) “completely dried out”  tariff and non-tariff barriers were erected against Maldivian products  and concessional financing was no longer available. Another issue often discussed at the meeting was the special situation of landlocked developing countries.  Botswana’s representative noted that their transport costs were higher  their economies frequently depended on a single commodity  and their economic growth was vulnerable to external fiscal crises and volatile commodity prices. In that context  several delegates highlighted the need for a new and ambitious programme of action for those countries  built on the experience of the Almaty Programme of Action.  Costa Rica’s representative said that such a programme must address the issues including freer access to and from coastlines  development and maintenance of infrastructure  improvement of trade  economic and structural transformations of the economy  and capacity-building to address the effects of climate change. Furthermore  Zambia’s representative stated that the multilateral trading system should support better the needs of those countries.  She welcomed the Bali trade facilitation agreement but called for preferential treatment for landlocked countries  to improve competitiveness  capacity  value addition and diversity of exports.  Gyan Chandra Acharya  Under-Secretary-General and High Representative of Least Developed Countries  Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States  said that regional integration should be promoted and the global partnerships to help landlocked countries should be improved at the Vienna Conference. The Committee also concluded its debate on the eradication of poverty  with several speakers highlighting inclusiveness as a vital aspect of achieving that goal.  A representative of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said the policy priorities outlined in the Secretary-General’s report could only be successful if they were based on an approach that promoted the social and economic inclusion and empowerment of marginalized groups and vulnerable people. The importance of access to decent work was also mentioned  with a representative of the International Labour Organization (ILO) noting that where decent work was scarce there was less growth  less security  and less human and economic development.  She welcomed the proposal to include the promotion of full and productive employment and decent work for all  as well as social protection systems and measures  in the new set of goals. Speaking on poverty eradication were representatives of Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Rwanda. The Permanent Observer for the Holy See also spoke. Representatives of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)  and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta also spoke. Speaking on groups of countries in special situations were representatives of Myanmar (on behalf of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN))  Malawi (on behalf of the African Group)  Benin (on behalf of the Group of Least Developed Countries)  European Union  Brazil  Malaysia  United States  Zimbabwe  Ethiopia  Bhutan  Myanmar  Bangladesh  China  New Zealand  Lao People’s Democratic Republic  Morocco  Russian Federation  Togo  Kazakhstan  Japan  Turkey and the Solomon Islands. A representative of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) also spoke. The Committee will meet again at 10 a.m.  on 27 October to discuss Item 21 of its agenda:  Globalization and interdependence. Background The Second Committee (Economic and Financial) met this morning to conclude its discussion of “Eradication of poverty”.  It also took up “Groups of countries in special situations”.  The Committee had before it reports related to least developed countries and landlocked developing countries (documents A/69/270  A/69/95-E/2014/81  and A/69/170). Eradication of Poverty MAYTHONG THAMMAVONGSA (Lao People’s Democratic Republic)  associating himself with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the “Group of 77” and China  said his country had made poverty eradication and rural development one of its top priorities in its 2010-2015 socioeconomic development plan.  The Millennium Development Goals had been mainstreamed into that plan  and his country hoped to achieve those targets in 2015 and to graduate from least developed country status by 2020.  The macroeconomy had been stable  and the economy had grown by 8.2 per cent annually over the past three years.  The national poverty ratio had been on the decline and currently stood at 20.5 per cent.  As some of the country’s Millennium Goals were still off track  the country believed the Goals needed to be carried over to the sustainable development goals  and that poverty eradication should be made a priority. JEANNE D’ARC BYAJE (Rwanda)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  and the African Group  said that even though Africa had sustained positive economic growth in the last 20 years  the process had not translated significantly in the reduction of poverty.  Progress towards controlling poverty remained uneven  with an increasing number of people living in the threshold of poverty in most developing countries.  On top of promoting global economic growth  more efforts must be deployed in building individual and community-level capabilities  assisting national policies and strategies  ensuring increased access to services such as health and education  improving access to decent work  and recognizing the importance of information and communications technology among other enablers. Since 2000  her country had managed to sustain its economic growth and to reduce income inequality  thus lifting more than one million out of poverty and providing social protection to the most vulnerable. BERNARDITO CLEOPAS AUZA (Holy See) said that “countries should develop evidence-based policies and strategies to combat extreme poverty  rather than relying on pre-conceived one-size-fits-all solutions”.  Sustainable development required the participation of all in the life of families  communities  organizations and societies.  “Participation is an antidote to exclusion”  be it economic  social  political or cultural.  The exclusion of women from equal and active participation in the development of their communities was a barrier to sustainable development.  Poverty was not mere exclusion from economic development  he said  “it is as multifaceted and multidimensional as the human person himself or herself”.  Development was more than the sum total of resources invested into projects and their measurable material results.  In efforts to eradicate poverty  the world must promote “the authentic development of the whole person and of all peoples”. AMBER BARTH  ILO  said that last year’s extreme poverty was reduced by only 2.7 per cent  one of the lowest rates of reduction in the past decade.  The global workforce had been growing at around 42.6 million people per year.  However  only about 40 million were finding work  and about half of those were finding wage employment.  Where decent work was scarce there was less growth  less security  and less human and economic development.  She commended the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals which had proposed that promoting full and productive employment and decent work for all  as well as social protection systems and measures  should be included in the new set of goals. MICHELE KLEIN SOLOMON  IOM  said that inclusiveness was a vital aspect of poverty eradication.  A lack of it was often a primary barrier to improving migrants’ development outcomes.  The policy priorities outlined in the Secretary-General’s report could only be fully successful if they were based on an approach that promoted the social and economic inclusion and empowerment of marginalized groups and people in vulnerable situations.  Measures in the post-2015 development agenda should maximize the development potential of migration and help reduce poverty  as migration was a key factor in poverty eradication. AJAY MADIWALE  International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies  said building the resilience of vulnerable people to withstand shocks such as disasters and emergencies was an essential aspect of poverty reduction.  The poorest tended to live in hazard-prone areas within countries  including flood plains  informal settlements  and on degraded land.  Disasters caused setbacks to poverty eradications  as seen in the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and the 2011 drought in Djibouti  which resulted in a return to pre-2001 poverty levels in both countries.  The failure of the Millennium Development Goals to address the risk factors which pushed people into poverty could not be repeated in the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda. BERTRAND DE LOOZ KARAGEORGIADES (Sovereign Military Order of Malta) said the Order’s primary mission was assisting people who were suffering and he listed humanitarian work in which it was involved  which included the funding of ambulances.  The “White Cross” was working more closely with the Red Cross and the United Nations.  Ebola was a priority and the Order was channelling funds to Guinea and had sent protective equipment to Liberia. Groups of Countries in Special Situations GYAN CHANDRA ACHARYA  Under-Secretary-General and High Representative of Least Developed Countries  Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States  introduced three reports.  On implementation of the Programme of Action for the least developed countries for the Decade 2011-2020 (document A/69/95-E/2014/81)  he gave an overview of economic activity in least developed countries and looked to their near term prospects.  Progress had varied across the goals and targets of the priority areas of the Istanbul Programme of Action.  He noted a decline in ODA from Development Assistance Committee members in 2012  and stressed the centrality of ODA and other means of implementation to least developed countries’ development. Turning to the report on strengthening investment promotion regimes for foreign direct investment in the least developed countries (document A/69/270)  he said that foreign direct investment flows to least developed countries had risen steadily since 2000.  However  further efforts were needed to establish better rules and regulations governing foreign direct investment entry  operations and treatment.  The report also proposed establishment of an international investment support centre dedicated to least developed countries.  On the 10-year review of the implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action (document A/69/170)  he said landlocked countries remained hampered by their geography to enter international trade.  Growth and trade had improved but trends were volatile and not shared equally.  Efforts on transport and transit efforts had reduced expenses but export costs remained high and continued to grow.  In the next development phase  there should be a more holistic approach to the challenges faced by landlocked developing countries  focusing on developing productive capacities  adding value to exports and diversifying economies.  Regional integration should be promoted and the global partnerships to help landlocked countries should be improved at the Vienna Conference. PAMELA GRACE LUNA TUDELA (Bolivia)  speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 developing countries and China  said the current global financial and economic crisis undermined the development in the least developed countries  many of which “continue to lag in meeting most of the internationally agreed development goals”.  She emphasized the need for the full implementation of the commitments made in the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2020.  Moreover  she supported the initiatives that would serve as key enablers for those countries to reach the stage of graduation. On landlocked developing countries  she expressed concern about the fact that the economic growth and social well-being of those countries remained vulnerable to external shocks  as well as to the financial and economic crisis and climate change.  The international community must enhance development assistance to those countries to help them overcome their vulnerabilities  build resilience and set themselves on a path of sustainable social and economic development.  She urged development partners to “provide sufficient  reliable and predictable financial and technical assistance to LLDCs [landlocked developing countries] to address the specific needs and challenges imposed by their particular geographical situation” in the new Programme of Action. DENIS RÉGIS (Haiti) spoke on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  and associated himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC).  He said that much effort was still necessary to achieve the goals decided in Istanbul by 2020.  He was concerned about the ongoing decrease in ODA and the weak global economic recovery affecting the Aid for Trade initiative.  He spoke about several challenges faced by the least developed countries.  For example  the relative importance of different sectors of the economy in most of those countries had hardly changed in the past 10 years  and less than a third of their population had access to electricity.  Moreover  as more than 70 per cent of their population lived in rural areas  productivity of their agricultural practices must be improved.  On trade  the rates in least developed countries had significantly decreased in 2012  and the pace of developed countries opening their markets to those countries had slowed. Haiti sought to graduate from the list of least developed countries in a specific and realistic timeframe  he said.  For the first time in history  the country had leaders from business and the private sector  who understood the importance of investment as the driving force of growth and sustainable development.  They were working to implement policies that could rework the legal context and the business climate to ensure an increase in the amount of foreign direct investment in Haiti.  Such investment could have a cross-cutting benefit in terms of the three dimensions of sustainable development.  He welcomed recent statistics showing a significant increase in foreign direct investment to least developed countries over the 2011-2013 period compared to the 2001-2003 period.  He also reiterated the importance of putting those countries at the heart of the post-2015 agenda to ensure that “everybody has a dignified life”. PAULA COTO-RAMÍREZ (Costa Rica)  speaking on behalf of CELAC  reaffirmed the Community’s belief in the need for a new and ambitious programme of action for the landlocked developing countries  built on the experience of implementing the Almaty Programme of Acton.  He stressed the importance of promoting new partnerships with the United Nations development system and relevant agencies that would include the accountability mechanisms of Member States.  It was crucial to establish a time-bound programme that laid out responsibilities of development partners and transit developing countries.  That programme needed to address issues of interest to landlocked developing countries  those included:  freer access to and from coastlines; development and maintenance of infrastructure; improvement of trade; economic and structural transformations of their economies; and capacity-building in order to address the effects of climate change. He called on the international community to support landlocked developing countries in transforming their economies  and to provide an enhanced level of financial and technical support.  That support included ODA and cooperation in accordance with the Nairobi Outcome document of the United Nations Conference on South-South cooperation. MWABA PATRICIA KASESE-BOTA (Zambia)  pointed to progress in implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action  particularly on transport issues  like harmonization of transit policies; laws to reduce transit times for exports and imports; maintenance of transport infrastructure  and streamlining of border facilities and procedures.  Economic growth and trade had increased and the special needs of landlocked countries were more visible and recognized in the international arena.  Challenges remained which hampered economic growth and poverty eradication  including low investment in regional infrastructure  low competitiveness  vulnerability to external shocks  and climate change. Improvements were needed in the multilateral trading system to make it support better the needs of landlocked developing countries  she said  calling for an ambitious new Programme of Action that was transformative and ambitious on expanding trade and reducing gaps between landlocked countries and other groups.  She welcomed the trade facilitation agreement concluded in Bali but called for preferential treatment for landlocked countries  to improve competitiveness  capacity  value addition and diversity of exports.  The 10-Year Review Conference for the Almaty Programme should focus on trade and integrating landlocked countries better into the global market.  Key priorities should include cooperation on transport policies; internal infrastructure development; increasing investment; diversifying exports; regional integration; and building resilience to emerging challenges.  Scaled-up support from development partners and the United Nations was needed. U KYAW TIN (Myanmar) spoke on behalf of ASEAN and associated himself with the Group of 77 and China.  He said that the uneven recovery of the global economy since the economic crisis had continued to have negative impacts on many developing countries  as well as States in special situations.  He called for a renewed dedication to stakeholders in North-South  South-South  and triangular cooperation to achieve development goals of countries in special situations.  Further  he said that the Association supported the establishment of a high-level panel of experts to define the functions  structure and funding sources of the Technology Bank for least developed countries. The upcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would be a stepping stone for the Summit on the post-2015 development agenda  and he urged development partners to deliver on their pledges to countries in special situations.  Since the Almaty Programme of Action  progress among landlocked developing countries had been uneven  and he hoped that the upcoming conference on those countries in November would help shape a new development agenda.  All three least developed countries of ASEAN had announced their intention to graduate from that status by 2020  and he envisioned the Association as a “thriving regional group with stronger economies”. CHARLES P. MSOSA (Malawi)  speaking on behalf of the African Group  and associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said his continent had built stronger institutions  registered results in implementing the Millennium Goals  and was working towards regional cooperation and integration.  Notwithstanding the progress made  much remained to be done.  The economic structures of many African countries were yet to develop to address various socioeconomic and environmental challenges  and the progress towards several Goals was uneven.  “It is unacceptable that 227 million Africans are starving  while Africa has the potential to feed itself and the world”  he said.  It was in that regard  that the continent’s Governments were pursuing agriculture transformation.  Further  they focused on infrastructure development  as well as on structural economic transformation and inclusive growth through industrialization and value addition. He urged the international community to intensify efforts towards implementation of the commitments made in the Istanbul Programme of Action.  He also called for the fulfilment of all ODA commitments made towards the African countries  and for the timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access for all least developed countries.  Concerning landlocked developing countries  there must be a focus on addressing their specific needs due to their geographic situation.  In conclusion  he highlighted the special challenges faced by countries in conflict situations and those emerging from conflict. JEAN-FRANCIS ZINSOU (Benin)  speaking on behalf of the Group of Least Developed Countries and association himself with the Group of 77 and China  pointed to “mixed results” in implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action.  Least developed countries were vulnerable to shocks  as illustrated by the Ebola outbreak in West Africa  where health systems were “on the verge of collapse”.  Support was needed for a crisis mitigation and resilience building fund and the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries  Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States should take the lead on that.  The most important priority of the Programme of Action was productive capacity-building and the Cotonou Agenda was clear on least developed countries special needs on that  as well as structural transformation.  He welcomed Turkey’s decision to host a Technology Bank and Science  Technology and Innovation support mechanism.  Least developed countries planned to double their share of global exports by 2020 and duty-free  quota-free market access was needed to help achieve that  as well as the elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers.  ODA was vital  as were debt relief and South-South cooperation.  On investment promotion  he said “we cannot be content with the result achieved” and called for “robust measures” to foster investments in least developed countries. AMERICO BEVIGLIA ZAMPETTI (Italy)  speaking on behalf of the European Union  confirmed the Union’s determination to deepen partnerships with the least developed and landlocked developing countries  as well as its commitment to the Istanbul Programme of Action.  Development cooperation was increasingly focused on countries with the greatest need and for greatest impact.  The European Union States would continue to accompany the least developed countries in their structural reforms  and were ready to promote trilateral cooperation with other Southern partners.  He reaffirmed the Union’s commitment to provide increasingly focused Aid for Trade  and noted that the least developed countries benefited from duty-free  quota-free access to the European Union market under the reformed Global Scheme of Preferences. He said that the European Union was committed to strong  transparent  and predictable engagement to accompany the least developed countries as they transitioned from the least developed category.  The Union believed that the upcoming Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries and its outcome documents should concentrate on key areas of relevance to the countries and on the key “bottleneck” areas of transit  transport and commercial transaction costs  trade facilitations  and regional integration. GUILHERME DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the CELAC  said that as the international community moved forward with the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action for least developed countries  due importance must be given to bilateral and regional initiatives.  Brazil developed many regional cooperation initiatives with those countries  channelled through the Brazilian Cooperation Agency — ABC.  An important example was the joint project  together with the Brazilian Agricultural Research Institute for the development of the cotton industry in the Cotton-4 countries and Togo.  Another initiative was the construction of a generic medicine plant in Mozambique.  In the case of landlocked developing countries  Brazil served as an important transit country for Paraguay  and had implemented various projects designed to improve the latter’s access to the sea. VANITHA GOPALAKRISHNAN (Malaysia)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  and the ASEAN  said that three years into the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action  least developed countries had made some progress on many of the Programme’s goals and targets.  However  poverty remained high with almost half of their citizens living on less than $1.25 a day.  Progress had been modest on education  gender inequalities remained high  and physical infrastructure continued to be largely below the international standard.  Her country had committed itself to assisting small island developing States in their pursuit of sustainable development.  It had pledged $1 million towards conducting courses and programmes to support genuine  enduring and sustainable partnerships with those States in the fields of public administration and management  tourism  environment and other areas based on their development needs. JILL DERDERIAN (United States) said that her country remained committed to least developed countries  and had provided them with $8.4 billion in ODA in 2013.  However  helping them with their development must be more than just about the ODA levels.  First  the effects of conflict on trapping poor countries at the lowest levels of development had to be recognized.  Second  major development progress in those countries required a continuous commitment of transparent and accountable Governments.  Third  the creation of a stable and predictable investment environment was crucial for achieving more foreign investment.  She also welcomed the efforts to develop a smooth graduation process  with advanced planning  including between donors and recipients  playing a crucial role.  Concerning landlocked developing countries  she said that they continued to face very real challenges but the conference in Vienna was taking place “at a hopeful time”. DURGA PRASAD BHATTARAI (Nepal) aligned himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Groups of Least Developed Countries and of Landlocked Developing Countries.  He said Nepal had “a prohibitively high cost and alarmingly vulnerable economy”.  The primary responsibility for development lay with the national Government but development was not possible alone.  The plight of countries in special situations had been diagnosed  treatment plans made  and responsibilities allocated  but actual treatment was “progressing sluggishly”.  The means of implementation were vital but had “long been less than needed and incoherent”.  Despite work on the Millennium Summit and Declaration  “a lot less than would  could and should have been done” had been achieved.  Most least developed countries were off-track on the Millennium Goals  and 46.2 per cent of people in those countries remained in extreme poverty.  Development efforts suffered from a resource gap and Nepal’s ambition to graduate by 2022 demanded enhanced  predictable and continued international support in all areas.  He noted the challenges faced by landlocked developing countries and said the new programme of action needed to address the concerns and needs of those countries holistically. AHMED SAREER (Maldives) aligned himself with the Group of 77 and China and the Alliance of Small Island States.  He was proud that his country had graduated from least developed country status in 2011 and noted that he understood the “challenges  the frustrations  as well as the hope and commitment” of countries in that category.  The process of graduation was “far from smooth” and the international community was yet to find a recipe to shape future transitions adequately.  States had to learn lessons from the Maldivian experience to ensure the next graduates had better support during transition.  Current determining factors in the process  such as gross domestic product (GDP)  did not reflect holistically the advancement of society.  After graduation  ODA “completely dried out”; tariff and non-tariff barriers were erected against Maldivian products; and concessional financing was no longer available.  The country remained at risk of backsliding in key social development indicators.  The Small and Vulnerable Economies category used by the World Trade Organization (WTO) acknowledged the inherent vulnerability arising from smallness and provided trade benefits to such countries.  He urged the United Nations to adopt a similar category and praised the successes of the Samoa conference on small island developing States. RWAYDA IZZELDIN HAMID ELHASSAN (Sudan) reiterated the necessity of follow-up on the Istanbul Programme of Action  calling for inclusive and effective partnerships.  The Programme’s objectives could be met if economies worked together to mitigate the effects of climate change  to provide decent job opportunities  and improve health  education and technology transfer.  Through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) least developed countries should receive more assistance and better access to global markets.  Foreign direct investment had to be enhanced at the same time as debt cancellation.  It was necessary to analyse why least developed countries were least developed  with reasons including climate change  lack of investment  a poor agriculture sector and dependence on imports.  Sudan had suffered internal conflict and its already weak economy lost 75 per cent of its resources.  She urged the international community to help by lifting sanctions and stressed the importance of debt cancellation to all developing countries. FREDERICK M. M. SHAVA (Zimbabwe)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said the economic development of landlocked developing countries had been largely driven by the export of primary commodities  whose fluctuating prices had hindered efforts by those States to reduce poverty  create jobs and achieve sustained growth.  The United Nations and other development agencies should help landlocked countries to shift towards the production of higher  value-added goods.  Deeply concerned by the decreased contribution of manufacturing and agriculture to the GDP of landlocked countries  he called for increased foreign direct investment in those sectors.  Multilateral financial institutions should also help the countries mobilize the financial resources required to develop a transport infrastructure AMAN HASSEN (Ethiopia)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  Group of Landlocked Developing Countries  and the Group of Least Developed Countries  said that despite progress made in achieving development goals  the enormous challenges faced by those countries lingered.  In the last decade alone  the proportion of people living in poverty in those least developed countries remained high  with 50 per cent surviving on less than $1.25 per day.  In that regard  the Istanbul Programme of Action must be integrated into the post-2015 development agenda given its focus on the most marginalized people of the world.  His country was implementing the Programme  which it had aligned with its five-year growth and transformation plan.  Also  in order to meet the targets set out in the Programme and to graduate from the status of least developed countries  Ethiopia was heavily investing in infrastructure development.  It was estimated that the development of landlocked developing countries was on average 20 per cent lower than what it would have been if the countries were not landlocked.  In that regard  he called for strengthened international partnership and concerted global actions to enable landlocked developing countries to overcome their challenges. KARMA CHOEDA (Bhutan) associated himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Groups of Least Developed Countries and Landlocked Developing Countries.  He said that while progress had been achieved over the past decade with the Almaty Programme of Action  Bhutan needed to diversify its economy and find new drivers for economic growth.  Infrastructure remained weak  leading to high trade and transportation costs.  The private sector’s role needed to be strengthened.  Twelve per cent of the population lived below the national poverty line and climate change had created a serious threat.  In Bhutan  glaciers that were the primary source of its river system were melting at an alarming rate.  To address their special needs  landlocked countries needed a new programme of action that built on the Almaty Programme.  The upcoming conference in Vienna was an opportunity to highlight the critical areas  which could then be woven into the post-2015 development agenda. HAU DO SUAN (Myanmar) associated himself with the Group of 77 and China and the Group of Least Developed Countries.  He said that without making sustained progress in productive capacity-building  many of the least developed countries would be unlikely to achieve their Millennium Development Goals.  He expressed concern over the recent decline in ODA to those countries  and called on development partners to fulfil their financial commitments.  He welcomed the potential of the Bali Package to enhance the advances of those countries in the multilateral trading system with duty-free and quota-free markets  and called for the integration of the Istanbul Programme in the post-2015 development agenda.  Through economic reform and increased ODA  Myanmar had registered a steady 7.3 per cent economic growth from 2012 to 2013  with expected growth of 8.7 per cent in the 2014 to 2015 period.  Preparations were underway for Myanmar to graduate from least developed country status. A.K. ABDUL MOMEN (Bangladesh)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Group of Least Developed Countries  reminded the Committee that there were 48 least developed countries which made up nearly 25 per cent of the United Nations membership.  Those countries were home to 860 million people  or one-twelfth of the world’s population  and nearly 70 per cent of them were poor and vulnerable.  Foreign direct investment flows had averaged $1.5 trillion over the last three years  yet only $25 billion  or 1.7 per cent  went to those least developed countries.  Technology transfer  along with investment  was essential to expand their economies and he noted resolution 68/224  which included a proposed Technology Bank for the countries.  Trade was another area where those countries were marginalized and Member States needed to implement the decisions outlined at the 2013 WTO Ministerial Meeting in Bali.  ODA was the most important source of finance for those country’s development programmes and he urged Member States to follow the guidelines of Monterrey and Doha. WANG MIN (China)  aligning himself with the Group of 77  said implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action had “not been encouraging” and that least developed countries faced “a herculean task” in achieving development but he appreciated mainstreaming of the Istanbul Programme by the United Nations system.  Positive results had been achieved on the Almaty Programme of Action but the overall situation remained “fragile” for landlocked countries.  The Vienna Conference was a chance to comprehensively review implementation.  China was a “staunch supporter” of other developing countries through South-South cooperation and the Ebola epidemic had harmed health and security in West Africa and posed an urgent threat to “global public health and security”.  His country had reacted rapidly  with immediately delivering batches of humanitarian assistance.  Close to 200 experts and medical workers had also been dispatched.  A fourth batch of assistance had been announced  and another round of assistance was under consideration. ANGELA HASSAN-SHARP (New Zealand) said the recent conference in Samoa showed that it was more important to take concrete steps to address the challenges facing vulnerable countries than debating the challenges.  Genuine and durable partnerships  led by the vulnerable countries  could involve any combination of Member States  United Nations agencies  regional and international organizations  local Governments and the private sector.  Each partnership needed targets  concrete outputs  planned outcomes and a timeline.  Those features would let the international community monitor progress  identify gaps in implementation and form new partnerships.  “It is the responsibility of all Member States to work with countries in special situations — each according to our means ” she added. MAYTHONG THAMMAVONGSA (Lao People’s Democratic Republic) associated himself with the Group of 77 and China  Group of Least Developed Countries  Group of Landlocked Developing Countries  and ASEAN.  He said that given the global landscape  it appeared less optimistic that the least developed countries would be able to realize the Istanbul Programme by 2020.  He called on the international community to continue to provide ODA.  To achieve its goal of graduating from least developed country status by 2020  his Government had integrated the Istanbul Programme into its national development plans  including its 2016 to 2020  8-year plan.  His country had made steady progress in implementing the Almaty Programme of Action in areas such as developing the road network  which would help realize the ultimate goal of regional connectivity.  His Government was also intensifying efforts towards an ASEAN free trade area.  After more than a decade of negotiations they had realized their goal to become a member of the WTO. ZAKIA EL MIDAOUI (Morocco)  aligning herself with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  called for an innovative and holistic approach to enable least developed countries to take charge of their own destinies and to implement policies that achieved development.  The next decade would be decisive for least developed countries and their development partners.  The global financial crisis  climate change  epidemics  and food commodity price fluctuations were among the challenges undermining their chances to deal with the problems they faced.  Resources were vital to implementing development policies and she looked forward to the 2015 International Conference on Financing for Development.  Her country supported least developed countries in many areas  including the environment  pharmaceuticals  and telecommunications. TATIANA ZVEREVA (Russian Federation) welcomed the intention of some least developed countries to graduate from the category and said it should be pursued in line with the provisions of the Istanbul Programme of Action.  Reaffirming her commitment to development cooperation  she said Russian assistance  excluding debt relief  totalled $610 million and gave significant attention to strengthening trade regimes.  Notable progress was evident on implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action and she described some national-level improvements made.  The new programme of action on landlocked countries should work more for their comprehensive integration into the global economy  on diversification  climate change mitigation and transport development.  The Greater Tumen Initiative was a regional transport strategy for northeast Asia providing for the creation of several transport corridors and she hoped it would help revitalize the global partnership for transport between transit and landlocked countries. KOUMÉALO ANATE BALLI (Togo) associated herself with the Group of 77 and China  African Group and the Group of Least Developed Countries.  She noted that the majority of the actions prescribed by the Istanbul Programme of Action had been integrated into the development policies of her country.  Sectors with strong growth potential were at the centre  as were infrastructure development  human capital improvements and the promotion of sustainable development.  Togo had seen “significant growth” of transport infrastructure  including the recent construction of their third double walled wharf for large container ships.  The port of Lome could now receive new generation ships and the port served the subregion’s landlocked countries.  Modernization of the international airport brought it up to speed with international norms.  Private financing and Government investment was responsible for “the entirety of progress made” and the Government had launched an economic governance programme to get the “economic house in order”. TLHALEFO MADISA (Botswana)  aligning himself with the Group of 77 and China and the Africa Group  said landlocked developing countries faced many concerns.  Transport costs were higher  their economies were not well diversified and frequently depended on a single commodity  and their food security and agriculture were threatened by land degradation and climate change.  Economic growth was vulnerable to any external fiscal crisis and volatile commodity prices while their geographic isolation boosted the cost of setting up businesses  which then hurt their ability to attract foreign direct investment.  Botswana asked the international community to increase its support to help those countries develop the infrastructure necessary for moving goods and services.  Assistance aimed at supporting the development of roads  railways and telecommunications services would help minimize the transaction costs associated with trade. Ms. YESHMAGAMBETOVA (Kazakhstan) emphasized that when considering a new programme of action for landlocked developing countries  priority areas should be in line with national development policies and strategies.  In addition  expected outcomes could be enhanced through partnerships at all levels and across sectors and should be based on the equitable sharing of benefits derived from the actions of concerned parties.  Areas for effective international support should also be identified.  She stressed the importance of regional integration and bi-lateral cooperation noting that there was further potential in areas such as energy security  transport development  trade facilitation and in promoting inclusive growth and sustainable development.  Economic diversification was also important.  As the country furthest from any seaport  she highlighted the need for effective transport systems and infrastructure. MICHIKO MIYANO (Japan) said the international community should continue to support the efforts of the least developed countries  and welcomed the fact that development partners had diversified.  Peace and security were among the most crucial prerequisites for development  particularly in those countries.  Moreover  private investment  especially foreign direct investment  and technology also played an important role.  Japan was engaged in the preparation of the Second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries in Vienna  especially in the consultations on the outcome document.  It supported a comprehensive approach in the new action plan  but the key focus should be on trade and infrastructure.  She also stressed the importance of disaster risk reduction to protect individuals and communities in least developed countries and landlocked developing countries. HAKAN KARAÇAY (Turkey) underscored the importance of foreign direct investment but noted that limited foreign investment went to a limited range of industries.  Innovative ways to increase investment should be sought.  A facility like the international investment support centre  dedicated to least developed countries  which had been recommended in the Cotonou Agenda for productive capacity-building was worth due consideration.  The importance of effective and timely implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action was clear  especially with the target of graduating half of the least developed countries by 2020.  “Further and urgent efforts” were needed to meet the targets.  Incentives to encourage graduation were needed and the process should be looked forward to “rather than an eventuality to be worried about”.  Smooth transitions were required to ensure irreversibility of graduation.  He stressed the need for technology transfer and attached great importance to the Technology Bank and science  technology and innovation supporting mechanism  which he hoped to host.  Noting Turkey’s assistance programme which worked in 38 countries  he looked forward to Turkey’s G-20 presidency when least developed countries would be among the priorities. HELEN BECK (Solomon Islands) aligned with the Group of 77 and China  calling for a sustainable global partnership to enable the graduation of half the least developed countries by 2020.  Foreign direct investment and productive capacities needed to be built and employment opportunities needed expanding.  Timely and targeted investment was vital to reduce poverty  particularly in agriculture    which could boost trade  food security and rural development.  She welcomed the Cotonou Agenda on productive capacity-building  noting that many least developed countries were also post-conflict and conflict-affected countries  and stressed the importance of investment to peacebuilding initiatives.  Trade was also vital to jobs and poverty elimination but least developed countries’ share remained low and there was a lack of will to conclude the Doha Round.  The National Sustainable Development Strategy was in place to translate the Istanbul Programme into national policy  noting its encouragement of partnership. Ms. HEHER  observer for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)  pointed to decreased numbers of least developed countries reaching the 7 per cent growth rate in recent years  with the trend testimony to the ongoing challenges they faced.  In that context  building productive capacities was vital.  Landlocked countries continued to bear high costs for trade participation  but trade participation was “an indispensable engine” for sustainable development.  Infrastructure and competitive productive capacities were the first prerequisites for trade and the “steady de-industrialization trend in LLDCs” was greatly concerning.  The Draft Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014-2024 was reassuring.  UNIDO was implementing its “LDC [Least Developed Country] Strategy and Operational Plan 2012-2020”  which emphasized South-South and triangular cooperation  and was devising several pilot Country Partnership Programmes targeting least developed countries and landlocked developing countries under the Lima Declaration. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-23,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gal3486.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. After deliberating on draft articles addressing the effects of armed conflicts on treaties and the responsibility of international organizations  the Sixth Committee (Legal) today approved  without a vote  requests for Observer status for the International Institute for the Developing Eight Countries Organization for Economic Cooperation and the Pacific Community. Opening the meeting  Sam Kahamba Kutesa  President of the General Assembly  stressed the importance of the Committee’s work in the maintenance of justice and respect for treaty obligations and international law — critical components of the Organization’s mission.  The Committee’s deliberations on the draft articles from the International Law Commission before them today was among the diverse and extensive work it did in the progressive development of international law  and encouraged the Committee to continue with the spirit of consensus as it considered the remaining items on its agenda in the coming weeks. The Committee then turned to the Commission’s draft texts on effects of armed conflicts on treaties and on the responsibility of international organizations.  Many delegations viewed the draft articles on the effects of armed conflicts on treaties mainly as resources  stating that the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties should remain the primary instrument for interpretation of the subject. The representative of the Russian Federation also noted that the texts  which covered a series of interrelated issues that could arise throughout the course of an armed conflict  also clearly reflected the presumption that armed conflicts did not necessarily entail the derogation of international treaty relations.  That would allow States to regulate how treaties might be applied during such conflicts. Concerning the draft articles on the responsibility of international organizations  speakers pointed out that the text followed too closely the articles on State responsibility  failing to take into account the differences between the two entities. Portugal’s representative said that  while the principles of State responsibility generally applied to international organizations  it would be preferable to focus on a specific set of draft articles dealing with issues specific to international organizations.  Such draft articles should reflect the competencies and powers of international organizations  and their relations with member States  as well as differences between them. Also speaking today were representatives of South Africa (for the African Group)  Finland (also for Iceland  Norway and Sweden)  Belarus  Cuba  Colombia  Singapore  Israel  India  Greece  Malaysia  Argentina  United States  Denmark (also for Finland  Iceland  Norway and Sweden)  Micronesia  United Kingdom  Pakistan and Fiji. The Sixth Committee (Legal) will next meet at 10 a.m. on Monday  27 October  to commence consideration of the Report of the International Law Commission. Background The Sixth Committee today would consider the effects of armed conflicts on treaties  and the responsibility of international organizations. It would also take action on the granting of Observer status for the Developing Eight Countries Organization for Economic Cooperation (document A/C.6/69/L.2)  and for the Pacific Community (document A/C.6/69/L.3).  For background  see Press Release GA/L/3480. Remarks by President of General Assembly SAM KAHAMBA KUTESA (Uganda)  President of the General Assembly  noting that the development and promotion of international law was a critical component of the United Nations’ mission  said the work of the Sixth Committee  in particular  was essential for the maintenance of justice and respect for treaty obligations and international law.  More so  it was closely linked to the priorities laid for the current General Assembly session  including those related to peace and security. The Committee’s deliberations on measures to eliminate international terrorism  he said  had confirmed Member States’ unequivocal commitment to condemn and combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.  The United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy ensured an integrated and balanced approach to counter-terrorism efforts  consistent with the rule of law and the protection of human rights.  The Committee’s work on the rule of law at the national and international levels  focusing on States’ national practices towards strengthening the principle through access to justice  would help advance the work in relation to the post-2015 development agenda. He said he expected that the Committee’s deliberations on the International Law Commission  including on its two sets of articles today  would underscore the relevance of the Commission’s contributions to the development of international law and its codification.  Also  given the strong inter-linkages between trade and development  the work of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) could greatly contribute to enhancing environments for sustainable development.  Noting the importance of the Sixth Committee in advancing the discussion on universal jurisdiction  he said the United Nations Charter must serve as its guiding principle.  He encouraged the Committee to continue with the spirit of consensus  as it considered the remaining items on its agenda in the coming weeks. Statements on Effects of Armed Conflict on Treaties KINGSLEY MAMABOLO (South Africa)  speaking for the African Group  commended the International Law Commission for clarifying and developing law on the effects of armed conflicts on treaties.  However  the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties remained the primary instrument regarding interpretation on the matter.  Pointing out that the definition of “armed conflict” in the draft articles differed from that in international humanitarian law  which had been adopted and applied in case law  he said those texts must not depart from established rules and principles of international law. Furthermore  he continued  rather than presenting an indicative list of types of treaties that should be presumed not to be susceptible to termination or suspension during armed conflict  as the draft articles did  it would be better to establish criteria to determine what types of agreements would not be susceptible.  It was preferable for the draft articles to be elaborated into a set of principles or guidelines that States could refer to  should the need arise  rather than into a binding convention. SARI MAKELA (Finland)  speaking also for Finland  Iceland  Norway and Sweden  welcomed the versions of several draft articles.  The scope of the draft articles should be broad enough to cover cases in which only one of the State parties to a treaty was also a party to an armed conflict.  Therefore  the version of draft article 1 was welcomed  as was the wording in paragraph b of draft article 2  regarding the definition of the term “armed conflict”; it accurately reflected its meaning under international humanitarian law  while accounting for the context of the present draft articles.  With draft article 7  the list of treaties  found in the annex to the draft articles  should be incorporated into the commentary to draft article 7  or possibly be deleted. ILYA ADAMOV (Belarus) said that since his country had often put forth proposals in connection with the articles  it would not repeat them in the current forum.  He expressed a positive assessment of the Commission’s work in filling gaps of international treaties  and highlighted the unfinished character of draft article 8.  There was still ambiguity on the future of an international treaty  which could lead to uncertainty in terms of rights and obligations.  Discussion on the draft articles  including the question of form  could be included in the Commission’s work or a special working group  set up in the Sixth Committee.  He expressed gratitude to the Commission for its serious work  and hoped that his country’s proposals would be found useful. ELENA MELIKBEKYAN (Russian Federation) said that the draft articles covered a series of interrelated issues that could arise throughout the course of an armed conflict.  It was of significance that they clearly reflected the presumption that armed conflicts did not necessarily entail the derogation of international treaty relations  thus allowing for States to regulate how treaties might be applied during such conflicts.  Furthermore  international armed conflicts should not fall within the scope of the draft articles.  That situation was covered sufficiently by the Vienna Conventions.  In addition  the same rules should not apply to international and non-international conflicts.  Noting that the attempt to define “armed conflict” in the texts did not correspond to the existing definition  they did not meet the standards of international law.  She suggested they be considered as guidelines for States on future practice  which could later be elaborated into law. TANIERIS DIEGUEZ LAO (Cuba) said that despite progress made  the draft articles suffered from the lack of a broad definition of armed conflict.  The definition must include statements that would make it possible to include other types of armed conflict that featured the direct aggression on the sovereignty of States.  For example  it could be indicated that the unilateral imposition of an economic  commercial and financial blockade against a State generated an immediate impact on the bilateral treaties between the two States in conflict.  Likewise  in order to achieve greater clarity  it was important to continue defining various elements  which had great importance in dealing with the issue  such as defining in article 18 — paragraphs a and c — what was to be understood as a “grave violation” and a “fundamental change in circumstances”.  The draft articles should not contradict the regime of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. MIGUEL CAMILO RUIZ BLANCO (Colombia)  giving an overview of the history of the effect of armed conflicts on treaties  said that the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties established  in articles 42-64  a general regime on the suspension or termination of treaties  but made no specific mention of the effect of armed conflict on treaties.  Thus  the elaboration of the draft articles on the matter represented a milestone.  However  from a legal standpoint  attempts to define the meaning of “armed conflict” went beyond the nature of the articles  which should only address their effect on treaties.  Furthermore  the draft articles should specifically address both international and non-international conflicts. LUKE TANG (Singapore)  voicing supported for draft article 3  said that the articles should remain as draft texts; there was no need to have them formally endorsed into a convention.  There was ambiguity regarding non-international armed conflict.  For example  the definition in draft article 2 did not explicitly refer to “international” or “non-international” armed conflict.  There should be consistency in the use of “non-international armed conflict”  so that it be expressly defined in draft article 2  or not used at all throughout the draft articles.  There was also difficulty with the analytical approach set out in draft articles 5  6 and 7.  The relationship between draft article 5  and draft articles 6 and 7  could have been more clearly articulated.  As well  he said he had difficulty with the broad categorization approach adopted in the indicative list of treaties referred to in draft article 7  preferring  instead  an approach that listed specific types of treaty provisions  rather than board categories of treaties. MEITAL NIR-TAL (Israel)  reiterating concerns that had previously been raised with respect to certain articles  said that on the inclusion of only one topical list of treaties  there needed be more substantive criteria as to what should remain in effect in the course of armed conflicts.  She expressed support for a more appropriate approach  whereby certain general criteria would be identified  which  if met  would continue to apply during an armed conflict.  Concerning article 15 on the prohibition of benefit to an aggressor State  in an extended conflict  given the complexity such a situation may pose  the question of possible benefit to an aggressor State should be considered as a relevant factor  but not necessarily the only factor to be taken into account.  Further work was still required on developing the substance and application of the articles  prior to examining the question of the appropriate form that should be given to them. JOÃO MIGUEL MADUREIRA (Portugal) said that the whole point of the topic was to determine the extent to which mutual trust among parties over the fulfilment of treaty obligations could be compromised in the event of armed conflict.  Thus  the goal was to discover how to strike a balance between the trust among parties as a prerequisite of treaty compliance  and the need for legal certainty.  However such issues as the inclusion of internal armed conflicts within the scope of application of the draft articles and the position of third States would be divisive in a diplomatic conference  as no practice  jurisprudence or doctrine existed that offered a clear and single answer to those matters.  Nevertheless  he said  “[W]e should strive to attain a balance between preserving the work of the [International Law] Commission and insuring the stability of international law through the adoption of a convention.”  A working group should be established in that regard. KOTESWARA RAO (India) said the definition of armed conflict should be limited to situations in which there was a resort to armed force between States.  The definition under draft article 2.b should not include international conflicts  as they did not affect relations of States under a treaty.  Concerning the annex that contained a list of treaties  the twelve categories of treaties could not be combined into one list.  They were different in nature and scope.  On the question of form  his preliminary view was that the draft articles could be considered for adoption as guidelines that would be available to States for determining the fate of treaties in a situation of armed conflict of international character. ZINOVIA CHAIDO STAVRIDI (Greece) said the draft articles offered useful and practical guidance for States and international tribunals  as they dealt with the impact of armed conflict on treaties.  Her delegation had consistently supported the principle of the continuity of treaties during armed conflict and the general approach adopted by the Commission in its recommendations to the Assembly concerning the draft articles.  The Commission’s recommendation that the Assembly should adopt a resolution  taking note of the draft articles  was welcomed.  That would encourage States to use them in specific situations.  The Assembly should consider  at a later stage  a convention based on the draft articles.  That instrument could be a complementary instrument  equal to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. WAN MOHD ASNUR WAN JANTAN (Malaysia) said it was premature to discuss the final form of the draft articles.  Consideration should be done at a later stage to allow Member States time to review them  and develop sufficient practice on the matter.  He also said that it might be premature to recommend the draft articles for elaboration or elevation to a convention  but would lend support if the draft articles were to be used as non-legally binding guidelines. MATEO ESTREME (Argentina) said a study of State practice needed to be based on consultations with Governments.  To insure impartiality  conclusions could only be reached when it was backed by all involved States.  In examining the effects of armed conflict on the termination or suspension of certain treaties  it would be necessary to establish which obligations in a treaty continued to be binding during or after an armed conflict.  The International Law Commission had considered not just the validity of treaties as a fundamental principle  as indicated in its draft article 3 that the existence of armed conflict did not ipso facto terminate or suspend the application of a treaty  but also the question of separability of treaty provisions.  As an example  he said the recognition of a sovereignty dispute and its characteristics could not be affected by armed conflict. JOHN ARBOGAST (United States) said he continued to be concerned about the definition of “armed conflict” in draft article 2(b).  The better approach would have been to make clear that armed conflict refers to the set of conflicts covered by the almost universally accepted common articles 2 and 3 of the 1949 Geneva Convention.  Regarding article 15  he said that he did not support the focus on aggression as defined by General Assembly resolution 3314.  The focus should have been on the unlawful uses of force.  The draft articles would be best used as a resource that States could refer to when determining the effect of a particular armed conflict on particular treaties  he noted  saying he did not support an elaboration of a convention on the topic. Statements on Responsibility of International Organizations CHRISTIAN KARSTENSEN (Denmark)  speaking also for Finland  Iceland  Norway and Sweden  expressed broad support for the draft articles on the responsibility of international organizations  which already served as a useful tool for practitioners and scholars.  However  he questioned whether a diplomatic conference would be able to produce a clear result that would ultimately ensure ratification by an adequate number of States.  Therefore  he did not currently support the elaboration of a convention. On an issue closely related to the topic  he noted that the issue of the settlement of disputes of a private character  to which an international organization was a party  had gained increasing importance.  The present system did not seem entirely adequate  particularly with regard to dispute settlement procedures in United Nations peace operations.  In that regard  further work could be done to ensure that private individuals who suffered harm as a consequence of peacekeeping operations were compensated.  As well  the Committee could further reflect on whether the present system and procedures were adequate to handle legitimate claims from private individuals. ELENA MELIKBEKYAN (Russian Federation) said that while certain issues in the draft articles on the responsibility of international organizations required further discussion  such as whether they had a right to self-defence  others had been resolved.  Among the latter  she noted with approval the conclusion that an organization’s illegal actions did not draw responsibility for those actions upon its membership.  Another issue favourably addressed was that an international organization could not rely on its internal rules to justify violations of its international obligations.  However  that principle did not necessarily apply to the organization in relation to its members; therefore  its rules could establish  for example  specific forms of compensation to States for harm caused by the organization.  Noting the practical importance of the topic  she expressed support for elaboration of a legally binding convention on the responsibility of international organizations. TANIERIS DIEGUEZ LAO (Cuba) said the conceptual definition of the term “international organization” was no easy task from a technical and legal view point.  Yet  despite the subject’s complex nature and the variety of existing international organizations  the draft articles had wisely gathered major principles of international law.  However  the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties should be the guide for any legal definition on the subject.  Reference to “harm” should be considered an essential element in the definition of an international illicit act of an international organization.  That element was what determined the obligation to make reparations  to halt violence  or to offer guarantees to the injured party that such harm would not be repeated. JANE CHIGIYAL (Micronesia) said it was clear that international organizations must be held accountable for their internationally wrongful actions.  In any instances when international organizations might act contrary to their obligations to Micronesia  her country would invoke the articles to press its case and secure reparation.  Although the articles reflected the progressive development of international law rather than its codification  the rules and principles deserved to be widely employed.  The Secretary-General should produce a report surveying how the articles had been used by Governments  international organizations and judicial bodies since being adopted by the International Law Commission. PAUL SCULLION (United Kingdom) said the draft articles were best left in their current form  as there was not yet a pressing need for a convention on the issue.  Since it was not clear that sufficient consensus on the law existed  it was unlikely that an inevitably long and complex process of negotiation would lead to sufficient consensus to adopt a convention.  In addition  it was not clear how the draft articles were being applied in practice.  It appeared they did not yet carry the same authority as the corresponding articles on State responsibility.  International organizations were incredibly varied and their practices were frequently based on their own constitutional instruments  rather than acceptance of general principles set out in the draft articles. NATALIE Y. MORRIS-SHARMA (Singapore) said the time was not ripe for the elaboration of a convention on the responsibility of international organizations on the basis of the draft articles.  Certain aspects of those texts  which sought to progressively develop the applicable rules  still presented some difficulty  she said  noting that she was not convinced that their application to international organizations would not lead to unforeseen complications.  However  the draft articles could be a useful lens through which to assess and maybe even inform the practice of international organizations and States  in connection with international organizations.  Future consideration of the matter was welcomed if it were accompanied by clear action items to facilitate future examination of the form the texts might take  such as requests to the Secretary-General to invite comment  submit practice information  and provide relevant past court and tribunal decisions. MEITAL NIR-TAL (Israel) expressed concern about the draft texts being discussed and their reliance on the articles relating to the responsibility of States.  Such reliance  without taking into account the inherent differences between States and international organizations  might lead to undesirable consequences.  Noting the diversity of international organizations in their substance and purpose  she questioned whether a convention could be uniformly applicable.  Furthermore  the draft articles “glossed over” the difference between the responsibilities owed by an organization to its member States  versus the responsibility owed to third-party non-member States.  As well  there was doubt as to whether the principle of self-defence was applicable to international organizations.  She questioned whether the notion of countermeasures by international organizations against States should be included  maintaining that the notion of necessity  a well-developed doctrine in relation to States  had yet to be encountered by an international organization. JOÃO MIGUEL MADUREIRA (Portugal) said that the codification of the responsibility of international organizations was the logical counterpart of that of State responsibility.  However  that did not mean that the first was required to derive from the latter.  The draft articles on the responsibility of international organizations followed too closely those on State responsibility.  Noting that the principles of State responsibility generally applied to international organizations  it would be preferable to focus on a set of draft articles dealing with issues specific to international organizations.  Furthermore  they should reflect both the existing differences between States and international organizations  and the fact that the competencies and powers of the latter  as well as their relations with member States  varied from organization to organization.  The General Assembly should be requested to take note of the draft articles  and only consider adoption of a convention at a later date. ZINOVIA CHAIDO STAVRIDI (Greece) said the articles would provide useful guidance to national and international courts when dealing with claims on internationally wrongful acts committed by international organizations.  However  given the scant availability of pertinent practice  they lent themselves more to progressive development rather than codification in international law.  Thus  the draft articles should not be seen as having acquired the same authority as the corresponding articles on State responsibility.  In that light  while the General Assembly should take note of the draft articles  it was not yet time to elaborate a convention. JOHN ARBOGAST (United States) said he was pleased that the general commentary introducing the draft articles noted the scarcity of practice in the area.  Many rules contained therein fell into the category of progressive development rather than codification of the law.  He agreed with the Commission that provisions of the draft articles did not reflect current law in the area to the same degree as the corresponding provision on State responsibility.  The differences between international organizations and States should be considered in that regard.  Furthermore  noting the diversity among international organizations with their different structures and range of functions  powers and capabilities  he said that the lex specialis rule set forth in article 24 was of “extraordinary importance”.  Thus  there could be differences in the way rules on responsibility operated between an international organization and its members  as opposed to an international organization in other settings. Action on Draft Resolutions Before the Committee was a draft resolution containing a request for Observer status for the Developing Eight Countries Organization for Economic Cooperation in the General Assembly (A/C.6/69/L.2).  It was approved without a vote. The draft resolution requesting Observer status for the Pacific Community in the General Assembly (A/C.6/69/L.3) was then taken up and also approved without a vote. Speaking after the action  Fiji’s representative said the approval of the resolution was a step in the right direction for sustainable development  especially in the context of the post-2015 development agenda. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-22,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaspd564.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The principle of linguistic parity in the United Nations required adherence to equity and balance and could not be superseded by resource considerations  a speaker stated at the Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization)  as it continued its annual debate on questions related to information. The current mandate established the need to issue press releases in all six languages  the representative of Argentina said  expressing concern at efforts to cite budgetary constraints for inaction. Connecting with new audiences without neglecting current ones  promoting multilingualism on the basis of equity  and using new platforms were essential for effective dissemination of the United Nations work  the representative of Costa Rica stated.  Commending the role of the United Nations News Centre on multilingualism  she urged all units in the Department of Public Information to emulate its work. The representative of the Russian Federation commented that United Nations Information Centres had been able to steer clear of propaganda campaigns being launched by certain countries. Other speakers  praising the Department for its work on disseminating information about the Organization’s activities  reminded it of its challenges.  “As the world grappled with the myriad challenges of the time  its 7 billion people were looking to the United Nations for answers”  the representative of Jamaica said.  “They want to know how the Organization intends to tackle the intractable problems confronting the global community  and how it can work on their behalf to transform their lives and improve their well-being.”  The representative of Jordan  calling for more transparent means of communication  urged the United Nations to remain an independent and transparent source of information for the international community. Several speakers cited fresh challenges emanating from new media that needed to be addressed.  While some irresponsible parties  including terrorists and extremists  were using modern media platforms for illicit purposes  the representative of the United Arab Emirates underlined  others used them to promote misinformation and disrespect of religions.  In that context  tools must be developed to discourage the use of social media for recruitment of terrorists or spreading hatred and intolerance  she said. The representatives of Ukraine  Guatemala  Japan  Lebanon  Bangladesh  Togo  Sudan  Libya  Venezuela and Iran made statements  as did the Permanent Observer of the State of Palestine. The representatives of Ukraine and Israel spoke in exercise of right of reply. The Committee will meet at 3 p.m. Thursday  23 October  to conclude its debate on questions related to information. Background The Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) met this afternoon to continue its consideration of questions relating to information.  For background information  see Press Release GA/SPD/563. Statements YEHOR PYVOVAROV (Ukraine)  associating with the European Union  said information was an important precursor to help overcome political  economic and humanitarian crises.  Ukraine thanked the Department of Public Information for its exemplary work in expediting the transmission of information  and for using  all mediums to share the activities of the Organization.  Dangerous geopolitical changes had occurred in Europe  and his country became the victim of the Russian Federation with its annexation of Crimea.  He expressed his gratitude to all States who supported Ukraine during that difficult period. The Russian aggression  he went on  was built on an information propaganda campaign aiming to brainwash Crimea inhabitants.  It was particularly cynical to have the Russian Federation working on the draft resolution of the General Assembly for progress in the area of information and telecommunications  in the context of international security.  He asked the Russian Federation to stop its information war  and for the United Nations to monitor the “international space” regarding the utilization of information.  In closing  he said information was a powerful “weapon” that should be used only to promote peace  mutual respect  understanding between people  and democracy. GABRIEL ORELLANA ZABALZA (Guatemala)  associating with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) and the Group of Friends of Spanish  said reviewing the Department’s policies and activities was a key priority.  The Committee provided an opportunity for Member States to review ways of achieving a fair and equitable information system.  The digital divide continued to grow  underscoring the importance of preserving the traditional media  which was the only information source for many countries.  He urged the Department to broaden social media in all languages  and requested statistics on the use of new media.  Regrettably  those figures were absent from the Secretary-General’s report.  Parity should be achieved in the use of languages in the United Nations  he said  expressing hope that the Department would evolve ways of ensuring that equity.  Creative use of resources was justified  he said  stressing the urgent need to issue press releases in all six official languages. CAROL VIVIANA ARCE ECHEVERRÍA (Costa Rica)  associating with CELAC and the Group of Friends of Spanish  said freedom of expression and transparent and multidirectional informational flows were central to democratic development.  Such flows achieved their potential when carried out within the framework of human rights and across multiple platforms  on the basis of parity and equity.  The role of traditional media should be recognized while new media was promoted.  Good public policies and citizen participation were important factors in that endeavour  she said.  Also  she added that countries working to bridge the digital divide should provide sufficient resources to ensure proper outcomes.  Connecting with new audiences without neglecting current ones  promoting multilingualism on the basis of equity  and using new platforms were essential for effective dissemination of the United Nations work.  Commending the role of the United Nations News Centre on multilingualism  she urged all units in the Department to emulate its work. SHINSUKE SHIMIZU (Japan) commended the work carried out by the Department  which covered all United Nations main priorities and activities.  Reiterating its support for the United Nations Information Centre in Japan  he said the country continued to guide it in disseminating information about the Organization to the Japanese public.  Japan called on the Department to ensure continuation of its efforts on a global scale.  The United Nations Media Seminar on Peace in the Middle East  held in Tokyo and organized with the Japanese Government and Sophia University  had brought together Government officials  academia  civil society  and journalists to discuss the media’s role in promoting transparency.  He asked the Department to ensure that the permanent exhibits on the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Peace Bell be returned to their original location.  The United Nations Impact Programme  since its inception  had promoted the Organization and built connections with institutions of higher learning.  Japan encouraged further expansion of the Programme.  The country also looked forward to the first ever observance of the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists.  At a time of dangerous challenges to international peace and stability  the United Nations stood as the key organ.  His delegation called on the Department to utilize its strategic operation to improve the efficiency and transparency of all activities. CAROLINE ZIADE (Lebanon) said that the Department of Public Information played a pivotal role in conveying messages with international scope  which should be strengthened through partnerships with other departments  the private sector  the media  and civil society.  Commending the Department on its use of a variety of communications tools — including the internet  social media  press releases  radio  and television — she stressed that the complementarity of traditional and new media platforms expanded the Department’s reach.  Widespread social media networks provided rapid access to information but also highlighted the vulnerabilities of individuals  companies and societies  she commented. She saluted the efforts of the Strategic Communications Division in promoting messages on peacekeeping  sustainable development  and other United Nations concerns.  The Department must improve the multilingualism of the Organization’s website and find a way to produce daily press releases in all of the official languages  she added.  She reiterated support to the Department’s Special Information Programme on the Question of Palestine in raising awareness on the situation.  Finally  noting that Lebanon was the host of a United Nations Information Centre  she attested that they helped spread the Organization’s principles to the peoples of the world. ABULKALAM ABDUL MOMEN (Bangladesh) said that  as a major troop contributor  his country highly appreciated the observation of the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers.  He urged the Department of Public Information to further highlight the heroic work of blue helmets in a variety of media  and reiterated that the names of peacekeeping heroes should be inscribed on a wall at Headquarters.  As Bangladesh was also one of the worst victims of climate change  he called on the Department to further apprise the global community of the impending dangers and the need for international cooperation  offering his country’s support in that effort.  Stressing the importance of linguistic and cultural diversity  he praised the observance of International Mother Language Day and requested a commemorative stamp be issued for it.  On United Nations Information Centres  he affirmed that their activities would contribute to the eradication of poverty  empowerment of youth and women  and help ensuring sustainable development. NOURA AL ZAABI (United Arab Emirates) said that modern media had played a major role in developments of the past decade.  Unfortunately  some irresponsible parties  including terrorists and extremists  were using such media for illicit purposes.  This represented a grave threat not only to societies and States that were faced with such activities  but also to international peace and security in general.  New media platforms were also being used by some to promote misinformation and disrespect of religions.  In that context  tools must be developed to discourage the use of social media for recruitment of terrorists or spreading hatred and intolerance.  Noting that her country had cooperated with the Department of Public Information on an Arabic version of the publication “Basic Facts about the United Nations”  she called for more material to be developed in Arabic and other official languages.  She also called for more focus on the situation in Palestine. KOFFI BAKAYOTA KPAYE (Togo) said that  despite efforts made to date  there had been a decrease in freedom of the press in the world.  In conflict areas  it was becoming more dangerous for journalists to exercise their profession  leading to the lack of access to information for many.  He supported the call of the United Nations for a unified effort to bring an end to the assassination of journalists.  Since 2004  his country had shown true political will to improve the situation of the press.  It had adopted policies to enable an increase in the number of private newspapers  radio and television stations  and press agencies.  Also  his country’s parliament had adopted an improved legal code in regard to defamation and personal injury  while the Government had regularly organized training sessions on ethics for journalists. ALEXEY A. ZAYTSEV (Russian Federation)  praising the role of the Department of Public Information in spreading awareness of the Organization’s role  commented that United Nations Information Centres had been able to steer clear of propaganda campaigns being launched by certain countries.  As the United Nations approached its seventieth anniversary  he said  the world must recognize that it was the only international organization that was universal in nature.  He called for efforts to strengthen the role of the Organization in maintaining international peace and security.  As the world also approached the seventieth anniversary of the victory over Nazism  it was important that the history of that time be preserved correctly.  On Ukraine  he said his country was always in favour of resolving the crisis there  based on peace and dialogue.  Those attempting to use the United Nations for propaganda purposes should instead take account of the true reasons for the crisis. ELHAFIZ EISA ABDALLA ADAM (Sudan) said that media had become a determining factor in the political  economic  and security sectors  as well as a driving force for many societies.  The Department of Public Information and its United Nations Information Centres had been playing important roles in spreading information on decolonization  development  and the principles of peace  among other issues.  In the area of information  it was also important to narrow the gap between advanced and developing countries in the field of digital communications  reduce socio-economic inequalities  and limit the occurrence of disputes.  It was also important to ensure transparency and fairness in coverage of events.  He appealed to international media outlets to abide by accuracy and fact-finding no matter the cost  because the “wrong piece of information” could result in violence and the loss of many lives. TAHER M. ALI GHIRANI (Libya)  commending the Department of Public Information on its role  in coordination with other departments  in disseminating information on the principles and work of the United Nations  stressed that “peace starts in the mind”.  This fact placed great responsibility on the Department when it came to spreading messages on the diverse areas in which it was engaged.  Narrowing the digital divide between developed and developing countries had become a central priority  he said  calling for greater international cooperation in relevant infrastructure  technology  and training.  The Department should work towards ensuring equity and parity in the use of official languages across all platforms  he added. HENRY ALFREDO SUÁREZ MORENO (Venezuela)  associating with CELAC and the Group of Friends of Spanish  said that large media organizations had played a dominant role in his country  posing a challenge to the dissemination of objective information.  Alternative and community-based media could promote democracy and raise the intellectual level of the people.  Communications media was a highly constructive resource  which should be used to achieve social justice and solidarity between peoples.  He supported the call to bridge the digital divide  and called for the adoption of measures that would lead to a more democratic use of information and communications technology.  His Government had provided computers to national  State  and municipal schools  in order to promote the correct use of technology and connect schools to the Internet.  He was concerned about the inappropriate use of technology by “some Powers” to intervene in the internal affairs of certain States  violating  among others  the right to privacy and the principles of the Charter. HOSSEIN MALEKI (Iran) emphasized the Department’s role in providing accurate  impartial information in a timely manner  to the widest possible audience.  Intolerance  extremism  violence  and terrorism claimed the lives of innocent people  he said  stressing that those issues should be brought to light in an impartial manner.  Iran proposed a collective effort — “A World Against Violence and Extremism” under the purview of the United Nations  warning about the danger of extremism.  That initiative should be incorporated in the United Nations public information policies.  The digital gap between developed and developing countries in the field of public information continued to widen  he said  reiterating that information and communication should be accessed by all nations  with a free and balanced flow of information.  He emphasized the responsibility of the United Nations in raising global awareness on the question of Palestine.  The Information Centres  especially in developing countries  had a crucial role in enhancing the Organization’s public image.  Iran fully supported the efforts to enable a more “linguistically equal” world in which information was disseminated  not only in the official languages of the United Nations  but also in local languages.  Finally  Iran attached great importance to the Department’s ongoing fellowship programme for journalists from developing countries. SHORNA-KAY MARIE RICHARDS (Jamaica)  associating with CELAC and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  commended the Department for its outstanding work.  Her country had sought to expand information and communication technologies across the island  as that was a key enabler of growth and development.  Jamaica was pleased with the Department’s use of information and communication technologies and social media in disseminating information  which demonstrated the Department’s desire to be innovative in reaching a wider audience.  Her delegation thanked the Department for its work on the International Year of Small Island Developing States.  Jamaica was pleased with the Department’s commemorative “international days” and other outreach efforts  such as the International Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade.  Particularly welcome were the commemorative activities held under the theme “Victory of Slavery: Haiti and Beyond”.  She said that the availability of campaign products in the six official languages  — as well as Haitian Creole  Kiswahili  and Portuguese — and the organization of events by 15 United Nations Information Centres helped raise awareness of that initiative.  This was of great importance to CARICOM and the African Union.  The Information Centres remained valuable sources of knowledge for small countries and in rural communities.  As the world grappled with myriad challenges  the constituents — 7 billion people across the globe — were looking to the United Nations for answers.  They wanted to know how the Organization intended to tackle the intractable problems confronting the global community  and how it could work on their behalf to transform their lives and improve their well-being.  As the ”voice” of the United Nations  the Department played a fundamental role in demonstrating what the Organization did to bring positive changes to people’s lives. SONIA ISHAQ AHMAD SUGHAYAR (Jordan) said the United Nations should represent the concerns and interest of all States.  The free flow of information at all levels and the rights of all people to free access to information should be guaranteed.  Information and communication played a crucial role in economic growth  poverty reduction  improving health conditions  and raising global awareness of human rights.  The right to seek and receive information was enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the United Nations should extend assistance to developing countries to enhance their communication capabilities.  The Committee on Information and the Department of Public Information played an important role as communication platforms  and should continue to provide adequate and non-partisan information.  The Organization should work side-by-side with local and international media to ensure diversity of media sources. She said that while terrorist groups sought to promote the culture of violence and extremism  information circulated by the United Nations could counter that by promoting a culture of peace and tolerance.  Finally  she urged the United Nations to remain an independent and transparent source of information for the international community. CARLOS MARÍA VALLARINO (Argentina)  associating with the Group of Friends of Spanish and CELAC  welcomed the report of the Secretary-General and underlined the Department’s commitment to promoting new media platforms  while continuing its support for traditional media.  Lauding the role of Information Centres  he said Argentina  like the Department  understood the importance and efficacy of reaching out to people in their own language.  However  it was a matter of concern that the Secretary-General’s report did not contain details on the question of multilingualism.  The availability of more statistics  broken down by language  would facilitate a better understanding of trends  which  in turn  would help to identify areas for improvement. Archiving material in all six official languages was important in line with the principle of multilingualism  he said  stressing that the amount of information in Spanish on the website fell far short of what audiences were demanding.  The current mandate established the need to issue press releases in all languages  he said  expressing concern at efforts to cite budgetary constraints for inaction.  The principle of linguistic parity required adherence to equity and balance  and could not be superseded by resource considerations.  Existing resources could be redistributed easily if the demands of the public were respected. SOMAIA BARGHOUTI  observer for the State of Palestine  expressed appreciation for the various activities of the Department of Public Information in raising awareness of the rights of the Palestinians.  The Department’s annual training programmes for Palestinian journalists had helped promote their skills  despite harsh constraints imposed by the occupying Power.  It was important for the Department to undertake other activities entrusted to it by the General Assembly  including expanding the scope of the audio-visual material on Palestine  as well as organizing and sending fact-finding missions to “reveal the facts” in the Occupied Palestinian Territory  including Jerusalem.  Israeli forces and settlers  she said  had been systematically carrying out violent acts against Palestinian and foreign journalists to prevent them from conveying the daily plight of Palestinians  and the reality of the aggressive Israeli policies.  They had also been responsible for the massive destruction of buildings  including media headquarters and journalists’ homes.  She called upon the Committee and the various international organizations that dealt with freedom of the press and the protection of journalists  to intensify their efforts for the immediate end of Israeli violence against them. Right of Reply The representative of Ukraine  speaking in exercise of right of reply  said he was using the forum of the United Nations to bring to light the “duplicitous way” in which the Russian Federation stole Ukrainian territory and committed other outrages.  With Russian passports and Russian weapons freely circulating in areas of eastern Ukraine where Moscow claimed spontaneous action was occurring  it was very clear who the terrorists were.  The investigation into the downing of Flight MH17 was being complicated by the fact that the site was on territory controlled by Russian-backed elements.  As much as the Russian leadership would like  the “USSR” would never rise again. The representative of Israel  speaking in exercise of the right of reply  regretted that the Palestinian delegate’s remarks were inspired to incite hatred towards his country.  The Palestinians’ selective description of the situation in Israel was heard frequently  he said  adding that Palestinian delegates were silent when it came to the situation in Gaza  including crackdowns on the media  financial corruption  and systematic violations of human rights.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-22,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaef3404.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. “A fair multilateral trading system is essential to ensure sustained growth in global trade and create new market access and opportunities for developing countries ” Malaysia’s representative told the Second Committee (Economic and Financial) today as delegates met to discuss international trade and development. Thailand’s representative said that a universal  fair  rule-based  open  pro-development  non-discriminatory  inclusive and equitable multilateral trading system could be reached through collective global efforts. Several delegates called for trade to be part of the post-2015 development agenda.  In that context  the representative of the United Arab Emirates noted that the implementation of the sustainable development goals required capacity-building to enable developing countries to set their own trade-boosting policies. Echoing her view  the representative of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) said that assisting countries to integrate into the multilateral trading system through trade capacity-building was the “main vehicle for social inclusiveness  environmental sustainability and economic competitiveness”. The Bali Package and Doha Round were frequently mentioned.  Ethiopia’s representative called for the development dimension in the Round to be fully realized  and to provide developing countries with the required policy space to achieve their overall development objectives.  Jamaica’s representative noted that work remained to be done on the Bali agreement in terms of full implementation and in concluding negotiations in trade in services and the work programme for small vulnerable economies. Various delegates spoke about the success of their regional trade blocks.  Brazil’s representative  on the other hand  warned about the negative aspects of proliferation of bilateral  regional and plurilateral agreements  and called for a recommitment to the multilateral trading systems represented by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its agreements.  Similarly  China’s representative highlighted multilateral cooperation as the main channel for promoting growth in trade  reducing poverty and achieving economic development. The special situation of least developed countries was mentioned by several delegates.  Benin’s representative was disappointed that integration of such countries into the international trading system had “not yielded significant results”.  Namely  they held only 1.11 per cent of global merchandise trade  which was well short of the 2 per cent target for 2020. While full access to the markets of developed countries was generally available  he noted  the duty-free and quota-free access stipulated by the Doha Development Agenda was not fully implemented.  Moreover  least developed countries remained marginalized in South-South trade and needed preferences there as well.  The representative of Bangladesh said that Non-Tariff Barriers and Technical Barriers to Trade hampered the fledgling export markets of those countries. The importance of finding solutions to the challenges faced by landlocked developing countries in accessing international markets was also stressed.  Kazakhstan’s representative noted that exports from those countries were considerably more expensive due to the lack of sea access  and the 2012 Almaty Ministerial Declaration proposed the granting of trade preferences within the WTO. The Committee also continued its debate on the eradication of poverty  during which delegates reiterated the need for that issue to remain at the centre of the post-2015 development agenda.  According to India’s representative “the battle against poverty has not been won”  and the fact that one in every six human beings lived in extreme poverty should be “an affront to our collective imagination”. Mexico’s representative said that economic growth was important to reducing poverty but inequality undermined its effects and the new development agenda had to deliver on inclusion.  Tuvalu’s representative stressed that donor countries must confirm their global commitments and ensure common but differentiated responsibilities.  At the same time  recipient countries must ensure good governance  accountable leadership  good planning and fiscal prudence  while squashing corruption and incentivizing trade and investments. The meeting on international trade and development was opened by Ana Maria Menéndez Pérez  President of the Trade and Development Board  United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  who introduced the report on the sixty-first session of the Board.  The Secretary-General’s report on international trade and development was introduced by Mina Mashayekhi  Head of the Trade Negotiations and Commercial Diplomacy Branch  UNCTAD. Speaking on international trade and development were representatives of Australia (on behalf of the Cairns Group)  Malaysia (on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN))  Qatar  Indonesia  India  Morocco  Zambia  Russian Federation and Iran. Speaking on poverty eradication were representatives of the Sudan  Namibia  Trinidad and Tobago  Qatar  Venezuela  Iraq  Zimbabwe  Morocco  Tanzania  Ukraine  Nepal  Russian Federation  Zambia  Myanmar  Singapore  Mozambique  Thailand  Togo  Libya  Gabon  Japan  Malta  El Salvador  China  Cote d’Ivoire  Tonga and Canada. The Committee will meet again at 10 a.m.  on 23 October to conclude its discussion of poverty eradication and take up Item 22 of its agenda:  Groups of countries in special situations. Background The Second Committee (Economic and Financial) met this morning to discuss international trade and development.  The Committee had before it several reports (documents A/69/179  A/69/15 (Part I)  A/69/15 (Part II)  A/69/15 (Part III)  A/69/15 (Part IV)  and A/C.2/69/2).  It also concluded its debate on eradication of poverty. Introduction of Reports ANA MARIA MENÉNDEZ PÉREZ  President of the Trade and Development Board  UNCTAD  introduced a four-part report on the sixty-first session of the Board.  The high-level segment had taken place between 15 and 26 September under the theme “Tackling inequality through trade and development:  a post-2015 challenge”.  Discussions had focused on interdependence  development strategies in a globalized world  and the UNCTAD contribution to the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action.  Investment in Africa  trends in the international trading system  and the Conference’s assistance to the Palestinian people were also on the agenda.  Looking to the sustainable development goals  the Board discussed financing needs. MINA MASHAYEKHI  Head of the Trade Negotiations and Commercial Diplomacy Branch  UNCTAD  introduced the report of the Secretary-General on international trade and development (document A/69/179).  She said that UNCTAD would continue to play a key role as an engine of growth.  In a context of a significant transformation of international trade and the trading system  trade should be anchored in the post-2015 development agenda and an opportunity existed to establish new and more effective global trade governance that connected trade with inclusive and sustainable development.  The connection between the two would be an important topic for the Lima Conference in 2016. Statements SHORNA-KAY MARIE RICHARDS (Jamaica)  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  said that the Community remained committed to trade liberalization and had continued to deepen intra-regional trade through the CARICOM Single Market and Economy.  Their openness had made them vulnerable to the vagaries of the global economic crisis.  CARICOM Governments had found it necessary to enter into standby agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  in part to reduce debt burdens and stimulate medium-term economic growth.  Due to their precarious economic situation  it was imperative that any trade agreement include a strong development component. He said that CARICOM had in 2013 adopted the Regional Aid-for-Trade strategy to strengthen capacity to participate in the multilateral trading system.  The Community was convinced that an inclusive and transparent multilateral trade system was fundamental to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  and that such a system would enable the effective implementation of the Samoa Pathway outcome document.  There remained work to be done on the Bali agreement that came out of the Ninth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization  in terms of full implementation of the agreements and in concluding negotiations in trade in services and the work programme for small vulnerable economies. ALAN GRIFFIN  Member of Parliament  Australia  spoke on behalf of the Cairns Group.  He addressed the global imbalances and distortions in world agricultural trade  with the aim of creating more effective price signals for farmers.  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimated that the global population would increase to 9 billion people by 2050  when agricultural production would need to grow by 70 per cent  and in a sustainable way.  More investment in agriculture was needed including where food security challenges were prevalent. Yet the imbalances and distortions in agriculture continued to be much greater than those for industrial goods  he said.  The Cairns Group wanted the WTO to deliver concretely in agriculture trade reform  particularly for the most vulnerable member States.  It would continue to prioritize its efforts on the pending and outstanding elimination of export subsidies which were “extremely damaging for developing countries”.  It was unacceptable that those trade distorting measures remained in agriculture more than half a century after their elimination for industrial products. HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia) spoke on behalf of ASEAN and associated himself with the “Group of 77” developing countries and China.  He described recent economic developments in his region and efforts made to deepen regional integration on a range of development matters.  Underlining the importance of promoting fiscal soundness for sustainable economic development  he said ASEAN continued to accelerate and deepen economic and structural reforms  promote domestic demand and employment  resist protectionism and promote trade and investment.  ASEAN Economics Ministers had met to discuss broad issues related to integration and regional cooperation. Implementation of the ASEAN Economic Community was progressing  he said  adding that a post-2015 vision had been developed for the Community to follow its formation.  Consistent with the region’s intraregional trade  ASEAN States accelerated engagement in regional trade agreements  with the ASEAN-China free trade area emerging as the world’s largest.  He reconfirmed commitment to universal  rules-based  open  non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trade  which would contribute to global growth and sustainable development.  He urged the WTO and UNCTAD to continue monitoring protectionist policies and assessing their impact on developing countries and called for implementation of the Bali Package. JEAN-FRANCIS ZINSSOU (Benin)  speaking on behalf of the Group of Least Developed Countries and associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said integration of least developed countries into the international trading system had “not yielded significant results”.  In 1960  least developed countries held 2.5 per cent of global merchandise trade but now held only 1.11 per cent.  The current figure was well short of the 2 per cent target for 2020.  While full access to markets of developed countries was generally available  the duty-free  quota-free access stipulated by the Doha Development Agenda was not fully implemented.  Market access provisions needed improvement  including the elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers and simplifying rules  and developed countries should ensure immediate  predictable  duty-free and quota-free market access on a lasting basis to all products originating from least developed countries. He said that rules of origin needed to be reformed to reflect the modern commercial world  especially given the failure to implement the Bali decision on preferential rules of origin.  The service sector had potential  with exports for least developed countries doubling between 2005 and 2011.  Nonetheless  commercial services accounted for just 10 per cent of total exports — half the global average.  The erosion of preferences and lost tariff revenue had increased adjustment costs faced by least developed countries.  While many exports from least developed countries enjoyed duty-free  quota-free access to developed markets  so did exports from other developing countries  meaning least developed countries did not really receive preference.  Least developed countries remained marginalized in South-South trade and needed preferences there  too.  It was also important to improve trade capacity-building through aid for trade  and to eliminate trade distorting agricultural subsidies in developed countries.  Modern technology was needed  as was a change in the intellectual property regime.  The decision by the WTO Council to extend the transition period of Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights was welcome and least developed countries should receive fast-tracking of WTO membership. HAMAD BIN ABDULAZIZ AL-KUWARI  Minister for Culture  Arts and Heritage of Qatar  said he was proud of what had been accomplished at Doha and since then.  While today’s world was very different from that in 1964  flux  change and challenge remained part of the multilateral landscape.  While those processes were economic in substance  they were also clearly political in nature.  Thus  achieving tangible and sustainable results and agreements would only be possible by arriving at a political consensus.  He also highlighted the link between culture and sustainable development  and between economic and cultural development. The language of multilateralism in recent years had been one of confrontation  he said  calling for a new culture of multilateral relations.  “We have to find a new way of doing things that will build bridges even across what may seem to be intractable positions”  he said  as “today’s problems are too vast  and the stakes too high  to content ourselves with the status quo”.  In that context  Qatar would support a series of initiatives aimed at changing the negotiating culture in UNCTAD to strengthen its deliverables  “through cooperation rather than confrontation”  and “through understanding and compassion rather than through dogmatism and aggression”. OTTO RIADI (Indonesia)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and with ASEAN  said that unfavourable elements of the 2007-2008 financial crisis had generated pressure on his country’s economy  most notably the trade and financial channels.  Regionally  certain factors dampened growth and future trade  including the problem of corruption.  Of the region’s developing economies  40 per cent ranked in the bottom third of Transparency International’s 2013 Corruption Perceptions Index.  The Doha Round negotiation of the WTO should continue to be supported  including the full implementation of the Bali Package.  At the 2015 International Conference on Financing for Development  financing for South-South trade should be included as one of the issues to be discussed. TENGKU MOHD DZARAIF KADIR (Malaysia)  aligning himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the ASEAN  said that it was time to ensure that developing countries were able to engage in international trade and that the WTO had an important role in ensuring economic growth through a liberalized  transparent and predictable global trading environment.  As of September 2013  his country’s total trade had expanded by 4.2 per cent compared to the same month in 2012.  Moreover  its global exports had risen by 5.6 per cent in the same period.  He looked forward to an expeditious conclusion of the Doha Round  as it would help to reduce protectionist measures and contribute to more equitable and inclusive growth.  International trade was an engine for development and a fair multilateral trading system was “essential to ensure sustained growth in global trade and create new market access and opportunities for developing countries”. AMIT NARANG (India)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that trade and investment  and an open  rules-based  transparent and non-discriminatory WTO-based trading system could play an important role in restoring global growth.  The increasing fragmentation in favour of regional and “plurilateral” processes was a challenge to the centrality and credibility of the multilateral trading system.  At the same time  the international trading regime must be made more equitable and development-oriented in order for developing countries to benefit from it.  He called for the conclusion of the Doha Round as per its development mandate  which was about “creating new opportunities and economic growth for developing countries in all sectors”.  His country remained committed to the Bali decisions.  However  food security must be treated with the same urgency as other issues  as it was central to eradicating poverty. ABDELLAH BEN MELLOUK (Morocco) called for a solution to end the current stagnation and blockage of the implementation of the Bali Package.  Trade was a determining factor in growth and development and an essential source of financing for development.  As such  it should be the key pillar of the post-2015 agenda.  The participation of developing countries in the world trade and South-South trade was increasing  with the latter accounting for one quarter of the world’s goods exports.  However  Africa had not benefited from that trade as much as it could have.  Therefore  its special needs and a number of obstacles must be addressed  including challenges in the areas of infrastructure and structural transformation. YOSEPH KASSAYE (Ethiopia)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said the development dimension in the Doha Round of negotiations must be fully realized  and provide developing countries the required policy space to achieve their overall development objectives.  It was paramount to find solutions to the challenges faced by landlocked developing countries  particularly in accessing international markets.  His country focused on increasing the benefits of trade by integrating itself into the multilateral trading system.  To achieve that objective  it was raising efficiency and competitiveness of the trading sector  strengthening domestic and foreign investment and trade  establishing a favourable environment for investors  and strengthening the transparency  fairness and accountability of the legal framework for trade activities. KHAULA ALI KHAMIS OBAID ALSHAMSI (United Arab Emirates) called for reform of international trade to make it more multilateral  calling for more preferential treatment to be given to least developed countries.  Trade should be part of the post-2015 agenda and implementation of the sustainable development goals required capacity building to enable developing countries to set their own policies to boost trade.  In that regard  official development assistance (ODA) and technology transfer commitments had to be upheld.  To boost participation in international trade  more effort was needed to ensure implementation of the post-Bali programme of action.  External trade was a major source of her country’s income and she spoke against protectionism  noting her involvement in several international trade instruments.  She noted cooperation with African countries  as well as work at home to improve infrastructure for foreign direct investment. WALUBITA IMAKANDO (Zambia)  aligning himself with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  noted the many international trade arrangements his country was part of which increased access to markets.  Despite the expanding role of developing countries in international trade and the growth of South-South cooperation  constraints continued to “impede the country’s ability to fully utilize preferential trade arrangements”.  Inadequate infrastructure and low productivity hampered the country’s ability to produce in quantities demanded and to the standards set by international trading community.  Measures had been implemented to improve the business environment and enhance competitiveness  notably the Private Sector Development Reform Programme.  He applauded UNCTAD for implementing the Enhanced Integrated Framework in developing countries and said Zambia conformed to it by mainstreaming trade into national development plans and strategies; ensuring coordinated delivery of trade-related technical assistance and capacity-building; and addressing supply-side constraints. YAOWALUK SUTHIMANUS (Thailand)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China and ASEAN  said that at the national level  the promotion of free trade remained the cornerstone of trade and development policy.  Pleased that the proposed sustainable development goals included trade-related means of implementation  her Government believed that through collective global efforts  a universal  fair  rule-based  open  pro-development  non-discriminatory  inclusive and equitable multilateral trading system was possible.  Special and differential provisions as included in all the WTO agreements had to be given to developing countries to enable them to retain adequate policy space for social and economic development. HONGBO WANG (China) said that as the international development agenda was in a critical period of transition  global economic governance needed to be improved without delay.  Some economies were at risk from being excluded from the global value chain through priority in trade negotiations moving from trade in goods to investment protection and from customs measures to domestic regulatory measures.  Multilateral cooperation was the main channel for promoting the growth of trade  reducing poverty in the world and achieving economic development.  Convinced that the integration of the world economy was the trend in today’s world  her Government was ready to strengthen cooperation with UNCTAD in an effort to promote inclusive growth and sustainable development in the world. A.K. ABDUL MOMEN (Bangladesh) associated himself with the Group of 77 and China and the Group of Least Developed Countries.  He said that though trade provided a lift to an economy  it was an area where least developed countries were most vulnerable.  In the last four decades  the total share of least developed countries in global trade had hovered around 1 per cent.  “Business as usual” was not going to improve the situation.  While most developed countries had fulfilled commitments made at the 2005 WTO Ministerial Meeting to provide duty-free  quota-free market access to the least developed countries  he said that some still had yet to fulfil on their pledges.  Non-Tariff Barriers and Technical Barriers to Trade hampered the fledgling export markets of least developed countries. TATIANA ZVEREVA (Russian Federation) underlined her consistent support for establishing a fair system where all parties complied with international decisions.  She supported the Bali Package and reaffirmed her country’s commitment to combat protectionism.  In line with support for integration of the global economy  she pointed to the Eurasian Economic Union between the Russian Federation  Belarus and Kazakhstan and welcomed the accession of Armenia to the Union.  The Union would remove barriers to trade in goods and create a single market for goods  labour and capital.  It was based on WTO rules and principles and turnover in the area had increased in the previous three years.  Based on recommendations by UNCTAD  the World Bank and other international institutions  the Russian Federation was working to improve conditions for doing business at home.  She trusted that UNCTAD would continue playing the role of coordinator in the international trading system. Ms. YESHMAGAMBETOVA (Kazakhstan) recalled the tenth Asia-Europe Meeting Summit when her country had stressed the need for a paradigm shift for international cooperation and to take action in eliminating protectionist trade barriers.  Kazakhstan was working to become a member of the WTO to maximize the liberal access of local products to world markets.  Another State programme of industrial-innovative development was recently adopted with the aim of diversifying the economy and the development of high tech industry.  Exports from landlocked developing countries were considerably more expensive due to the lack of sea access  and among its many recommendations  the 2012 Almaty Ministerial Declaration proposed the granting of trade preferences within the WTO. FERNANDO SARDENBERG ZELNER GONÇALVES (Brazil) said the third Conference on Financing for Development would provide ample opportunities to discuss macroeconomic policies and trade as real drivers of development.  With the Open Working Group recognizing trade as means of implementation for sustainable development  he highlighted the need for a stable  transparent and rules-based multilateral trade system.  Since the 2008 financial crisis  major trading partners had turned away from the multilateral system and embarked on a “worrisome path” of additional rules specific to large trading blocks.  Regionally managed trade could not be compatible with and supportive of a global integrated economy.  In view of the proliferation of bilateral  regional and plurilateral agreements  which shut off developing countries  he urged the international community to recommit to the multilateral trading systems represented by the WTO and its agreements. ALI HAJILARI (Iran) associated with the Group of 77 and China  stressing the importance of an international enabling environment to ensure that envisaged transformative change took place in several areas.  Trade had to be addressed as it was a powerful driver and enabler for growth  employment and poverty eradication.  Capacity-building was linked closely to enhancing balanced productive development strategies  including through a universal  fair  rules-based  open  pro-development  non-discriminatory  inclusive and equitable multilateral trading system.  Accession to the WTO should be facilitated and there should be no political impediments.  Trade barriers  trade-distorting subsidies in developed countries and other measures were a matter of concern.  The Group of 77 and China had affirmed “their firm rejection of the imposition of laws and regulation with extraterritorial impact and all other forms of coercive economic measures  including unilateral sanctions  against [several] developing countries ” and reiterated the urgent need to eliminate them immediately. RALF BREDEL  UNIDO  said that the integration of countries with small economies into regional and global markets promised expanded demand for their goods  and fostered job creation and income generation.  Trade capacity-building  with the development of quality infrastructure as its key element  was crucial  especially for least developed and landlocked developing countries.  It remained among the cornerstones of the work of UNIDO  and was an integral feature of virtually all its technical cooperation programmes.  “Assisting Member States to integrate into the multilateral trading system through trade capacity-building is a main vehicle for social inclusiveness  environmental sustainability and economic competitiveness ” he said. Poverty Eradication Mr. OSMAN (Sudan)  aligning his delegation with the “Group of 77” and China  the Arab and African Groups and the Group of Least Developed Countries  said that climate changes greatly exacerbated the impact of the many challenges developing countries faced  including poverty  food security and unemployment.  In pursuit of the goals of the United Nations Second Decade for Poverty Eradication  his Government had invested in public services and had sought to consolidate the role of women.  Foreign investment was being encouraged  and access to microcredit expanded.  A social support initiative had been launched for the most marginalized groups.  Poverty was worsened in Sudan by abandonment of traditional agricultural practices  lack of production capacity and desertification  all of which were worsened by the debt burden.  He called for lifting of unilateral economic sanctions to aid efforts to fight poverty. AMIT NARANG (India)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said “the battle against poverty has not been won”  and the fact that one in every six human beings lived in extreme poverty should be “an affront to our collective imagination”.  His Government had launched a National Mission on Financial Inclusion with the objective of covering all households in the country with banking facilities and having a bank account for each household.  Through that initiative  it hoped to break the vicious cycle between poverty and debt  and unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of people to be able to chart their own destinies.  His country also remained committed to the promotion of gender equality  and to utilizing information and communications technology for the empowerment of women. WILFRIED I. EMVULA (Namibia)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the African Group  said poverty eradication must remain central in the planning and implementation of the sustainable development goals.  The global trade and investment rules must be designed to meet the constraints faced by developing countries.  The impasse in the Doha Development Round which had negatively impacted development  the fight against poverty and the “Aid for Trade” initiatives was of concern.  The recent financial volatility was a reminder of the need to reform the global financial system and ensure a greater voice and participation by developing countries.  He also called for women to be at the centre of development and welcomed the proposals for a stand-alone goal on gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in the post-2015 agenda. EDEN CHARLES (Trinidad and Tobago)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and CARICOM  said that his Government had implemented a number of programmes aimed at eradicating poverty.  They included the provision of social assistance to poor and vulnerable groups  the Targeted Conditional Cash Transfer Programme aimed at providing social protection by promoting nutritional and food security among vulnerable households  the National Social Development Programme  the Poverty Reduction Programme  and the Micro Enterprise Training and Development Grant.  Also instituted were a number of initiatives in support of advancing women’s role in development  resulting in their strong presence in the non-agriculture sector  accompanied by a diminishing gap in labour force participation between men and women.  Also introduced were efforts geared toward addressing the “gendered digital divide”. Ms. AL-FADALAH (Qatar)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  stressed that  in line with the goals of the Second Decade  the priorities of countries should be to promote productive work  especially for the youth  improving agricultural productivity and improving the livelihoods of the poor.  She stressed her country’s commitment to eliminating discrimination against women and pointed to Qatar’s hosting of the third meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement on the advancement of women.  In Qatar  policies to enable women focused on the family.  Focus on them would help in the fight against poverty.  There were advances in improving the status of women  with efforts to provide a higher level of education among measures.  Girls outnumbered boys in primary education  with efforts also aimed at the labour market and to reduce practices like early marriage.  Qatar ranked thirty-sixth in the human development index and had the tenth highest level of education in the world. HENRY ALFREDO SUÁREZ MORENO (Venezuela)  aligned with the Group of 77 and China  pointed to a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report on poverty  which showed some unnerving trends like the vulnerability of 15 per cent of the world’s population to multidimensional poverty.  Around half of the world’s labour force held informal or vulnerable employment  in contravention of International Labour Organization (ILO) guidelines on safe and decent work.  Poverty was complex and tackling it required a multidimensional approach.  Poverty should not be defined on the basis of income levels alone and successful strategies for combating it showed the need to go beyond income.  Poor people were given free access to health care  cheaper food  lower interest on credit and other benefits to support their daily minimum income.  Education was fundamental  as was the provision of productive jobs  and assistance to the vulnerable. BARHAM SALEH (Iraq) stressed the importance of the industrial sector to his country’s economy.  He noted several structural problems that had caused difficulties in the industry and led to the sector’s decline in the country  reducing gross domestic product (GDP).  It was important to provide assistance to countries that were making efforts to eradicate poverty.  Developed countries had to commit and he welcomed the involvement of UNIDO  while also looking to the potential benefits of South-South cooperation.  He described several areas in which efforts to strengthen the economy had been made and described industrial and mining projects.  The aim was to promote profitable public enterprises and several policies had also been enacted to make the investment climate in Iraq more business friendly to encourage local and international investment. FREDERICK M. M. SHAVA (Zimbabwe)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that his Government had adopted policies and programmes aimed at economically empowering its citizens.  The most notable was the historic land reform programme which had seen more than 300 000 households being allocated land.  Agriculture was critical to lifting countries out of poverty  and it contributed 30 per cent of the GDP during a good season.  Trade was another factor that could help poor nations grow their way out of poverty  and the elimination of trade protection policies by developed countries was vital.  Zimbabwe’s poverty alleviation initiatives continued to be hampered by the economic sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States  he said  calling for their immediate and unconditional lifting. ZAKIA EL-MIDAOUI (Morocco)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  the African Group  and the Group of Friends of Financial Inclusion  said the debate on poverty eradication and other development-related issues illustrated that the world must “pull together” to enable all countries take advantage of the opportunities of development and the fruits of globalization.  Her country had launched a national human development initiative that  among others things  aimed to combat poverty in rural areas and social exclusion in urban areas.  A national human development observatory had been established to assess the impact of public policy on human development indicators.  Other initiatives that were contributing to combatting poverty and vulnerability included a medical assistance regime for the poorest populations that were not covered by mandatory health insurance. TUVAKO N. MANONGI (United Republic of Tanzania)  aligning himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the African States  said poverty eradication should remain at the centre of the United Nations deliberations.  It was unacceptable for children under five and pregnant women to continue to die due to poverty related causes  as it was incomprehensible that the world had over one billion people who could not read and write  and who practiced open defecation.  Commitments made towards developing countries including the least developed countries  would have to be fulfilled.  Three of four people in rural areas lived in extreme poverty  which deserved our amplified attention in the post-2015 development agenda.  It was estimated that one billion people lived in slum conditions in urban areas. SARA LUNA CAMACHO (Mexico)  aligning herself with the Group for Financial Inclusion  called for a rethink on the way poverty was approached.  In the context of the Open Working Group  Mexico had pushed for a multidimensional vision of poverty that looked beyond measurements of per capita income.  Economic growth was important to reducing poverty but inequality undermined its effects.  The new goals and development agenda had to deliver on inclusion.  She would continue promoting disaggregation in monitoring the goals with a view to reducing inequality and ensuring that the agenda served everyone.  The type of policies that were needed included income protection programmes  as well as provision of greater access to social services  particularly health care  education and nutrition.  The Open Working Group’s report pointed in the right direction and the post-2015 agenda had to promote inclusive growth. YAROSLAV GOLITSYN (Ukraine) welcomed national initiatives to speed up progress toward the Millennium Development Goals and to push for full employment and decent work for all.  To be effective  international programmes for poverty eradication had to be mirrored by national efforts  policies and strategies.  Poverty eradication was at the centre of Ukraine’s development agenda and the Government had joined with national and international stakeholders to foster pro-poor growth through employment and opportunities for the most vulnerable.  Women and youth were the focus of the State poverty eradication programme.  As well  Ukraine had launched projects to support social sector reform.  European standards of gender equality had been adopted  with women’s leadership promoted and discrimination combated. SEWA LAMSAL ADHIKARI (Nepal)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China and the Group of Least Developed Countries  said that poverty eradication should be at the top of the post-2015 development agenda.  Best use should be made of lessons learned from implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and the impacts of the global economic and financial crisis.  Least developed countries like Nepal needed modern technology to transform socioeconomic development  as well as enhanced and sustained financial support.  Noting that ODA to her country had risen to a record high  she nonetheless called on partners who had not done so to meet their target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income.  Her country placed value on debt relief  market access  capacity building and technical support  including transfer of technology with supportive and fair financial architecture and an international trading system for sustainable development. PAVEL A. FONDUKOV (Russian Federation) said that poverty eradication remained a priority and a precondition for achieving sustainable development.  Moreover  progress in achieving that goal must be made more equal across countries and regions.  His country was consistently stepping up its efforts aimed at poverty eradication  and saw industrial development as a key factor in those endeavours.  In that context  it was implementing  together with UNIDO  a number of projects  such as creating agro-industrial parks and improving industrial statistics.  He called on all parties to expand cooperation within UNIDO  and to share best practices in the field of sustainable development. WALUBITA IMAKANDO (Zambia)  associating himself with the “Group of 77” and China  said his Government had implemented multiple poverty interventions  among them a scaling up of the Social Cash transfer Scheme this year to over 145 000 individuals being supported  80 per cent of them women.  His country remained committed to other social safety nets  including the Women Empowerment Programme  the Food Security Pack  and the Public Welfare Assistance Scheme.  Financial lending institutions had been engaged to provide women entrepreneurs access to affordable financing.  Aimed at significantly boosting economic growth  rural industrialization  and employment creation  Zambia had focused on micro  small and medium scale enterprises.  The Industrialization and Job Creation Strategy was aimed at facilitating the creation of 1 million formal jobs over the next five years in the agricultural  construction  manufacturing and tourism sectors. YIN PO MYAT (Myanmar)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  ASEAN and the Group of Least Developed Countries  said that rural development was vital to achieving her country’s poverty reduction objective of 16 per cent by 2015.  Furthermore  to achieve the goals of the Istanbul Programme of Action for least developed countries  Myanmar had begun the internal process for graduation from that category.  She called on development partners to assist by fulfilling their commitments.  She also called upon the United Nations to strengthen system-wide policy coherence on poverty and employment issues within the framework of the second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty and stressed the importance of regional cooperation in such areas as sharing best practices  technology transfer and economic integration and liberalization as a means to raise people out of poverty. AUNESE MAKOI SIMATI (Tuvalu)  associating himself with the Group of Least Developed Countries  said the economic gaps between rich and poor countries and inequalities within nations must be thoroughly addressed.  That would aim to remedy the situation where 10 per cent of the population owned 75 per cent of the global wealth.  Poverty eradication was best tackled cooperatively between donors and recipients.  Donor countries must confirm their global commitments and ensure common but differentiated responsibilities  whilst recipient countries must ensure good governance  accountable leadership  good planning and fiscal prudence  while squashing corruption and incentivizing trade and investments.  Science  research and entrepreneurial development were key drivers of poverty alleviation and sustainable development  and research results and information must be shared and made accessible and affordable to the poor. ONG KOK WEE (Singapore)  aligning his statement with the Group of 77 and China  and the ASEAN  said that while much had been achieved in fighting poverty  progress had been uneven and there remained a sense that inequality was widening around the world.  His Government’s approach to poverty eradication was to create good quality jobs through economic growth.  Equal educational opportunities sought to ensure that all children were given the opportunities  skills  and training to pursue their aspirations.  Through the Singapore Cooperation Programme  his country trained thousands of Government officials from other countries  and through other collaboration  technical assistance was provided. ANTÓNIO GUMENDE (Mozambique) associated himself with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group.  He said that his country had enjoyed eight consecutive years of growth in GDP above 6 per cent as a result of having adopted a national development approach that gave priority to poverty reduction through economic growth  improved social safety nets  ensuring sustainable growth and strengthening good governance.  In addition  a District Development Fund aimed at promoting initiatives to boost food production and job creation  including vocational training and entrepreneurship for young people was in place.  The decentralization of decision-making on such issues as human and financial resources provided by that Fund had led to an increase in agricultural production  the diversification of local diets and a growing number of artisanal industries.  Thus decentralization and empowerment of local communities had proved to be an efficient and effective approach to poverty eradication. RATHANAND VICHAIDIT (Thailand)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and ASEAN  said that it was important to remain focused on the final push for the Millennium Development Goals  in particular the unrealized Goals.  There were several underlying  cross-cutting issues fundamental to poverty eradication.  Empowering the most vulnerable could ensure sustained  inclusive and equitable economic growth.  While all countries had to do their utmost to eradicate poverty and fulfil their development objectives  those efforts could and should be further advanced through global partnerships and assistance. KOUMÉALO ANATE BALLI (Togo)  aligning her delegation with the Group of 77 and China  the African Group and the Group of Least Developed Countries  pointed out that women were more active in the Togolese workforce than men.  However  they tended to occupy marginal positions  lacking access to means of production and to social redistribution.  The Government was working hard to ensure women their rightful place in nation-building efforts.  There was a particular focus on women in rural areas  and the Government supported projects to ensure women had tools.  About 45 000 women were being assisted with tools like power tillers  maize husking machines and mills.  Around 100 women’s groups had been fitted out with agricultural material and processing material.  Women were also being given training in cooperatives  animal and plant production techniques  managing loans and savings and other important skills. OMAR A. A. ANNAKOU (Libya)  associating his delegation with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  stressed that African countries suffered particularly from poverty even though the population living in extreme poverty had declined greatly between 1990 and 2010.  Inequality had grown  however  while ODA continued to drop and negotiations on a multilateral trade system stalled.  The international community had to respond to lessons learned from the Millennium Development Goals and the economic and financial crisis  making efforts commensurate with the challenges.  Women’s roles in development differed between countries and they assumed many tasks despite facing many obstacles.  There was unequal progress on the Millennium Development Goal related to women.  In Libya  women’s participation in politics had improved  with them holding 32 seats out of 200 in Parliament  as well as six seats on the body drafting the new Constitution. MARIANNE ODETTE BIBALOU (Gabon)  aligning with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  said a billion people lived in poverty  with women and children particularly affected.  Many more were on the very threshold of poverty.  The international community had to step up efforts to eradicate poverty in all forms.  Job creation  especially for young people  was vital.  Youth unemployment was at heart of socio-political upheavals and it often fuelled extremism.  Work and employment were vital  but sustained economic growth remained important.  Industrialization was a critical tool for growth and structural reform also vital in moving towards a service economy.  A focus on women was needed because they were especially affected by poverty  particularly because of cultural and religious reasons that intensified their marginalization. NOBORU SEKIGUCHI (Japan) said his country aimed to create “a society in which women shine” and had recently hosted the World Assembly for Women to promote their full and dynamic participation.  Globally  many “abhorrent circumstances” persisted  with women lacking access to basic services like water and energy.  That disproportionately increased their workload for no other reason than they were born a woman.  Human rights violations against women should no longer occur in the twenty-first century and fundamental rights should be ensured everywhere.  Action was needed by the United Nations and the international community to ensure equal participation of girls and boys in school  medical care for expectant mothers  and that no woman or girl lived in fear of violence.  Japan was promoting universal health coverage worldwide  believing it was “never too early” to aim for its achievement.  He cited a fivefold increase in contributions to UN-Women and looked forward to the establishment of UN-Women’s Tokyo office. CHRISTOPHER GRIMA (Malta) said that any reference  recommendation or commitment to rights and services in connection with reproductive health care should not in any way create an obligation on any party to consider abortion as a legitimate form of reproductive health or rights or commodities.  Committed to having more women in decision-making positions  his Government had adopted the strategy of gender mainstreaming to develop a holistic approach towards equality.  The economic independence of women and their increased participation in the labour market was a priority  and tax credits  subsidized childcare  and an increase in the number of weeks of paid maternity leave were among a number of family-friendly measures undertaken to facilitate women’s economic independence. RUBEN ZAMORA (El Salvador)  aligning himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  said the last effects of the economic crisis had led to slow growth and more restrictions on international financing  affecting developing countries in particular.  His country had been promoting sustainable development  as well as tackling poverty  reducing inequality  and advocating an agenda that focused on human rights.  By 2013 the percentage of homes facing poverty in El Salvador was 28.9 percent which represented an 11.6 per cent reduction from 2011.  Recently the country had approved the Law of Development and Social Protection  which for the first time included a network of policies and strategies focused on the most vulnerable of the population.  Despite national efforts  more needed to be done  he said  reiterating the importance of adequate and effective implementation measures  and a global partnership to promote jobs and decent work for all.  Full employment and decent work for all were critical elements in the post-2015 development goals. LU YUHUI (China)  associated himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that poverty  one of the most daunting challenges today  was the common responsibility of the international community as a whole.  The situation around the globe did not warrant optimism.  Efforts would have to focus on making poverty eradication the core of the post-2015 development agenda.  It would be necessary to implement inclusive and economic social policies  such as social security and health systems  compulsory education  and equal rights for women  children  older persons and people with disabilities.  It would also be necessary to provide concrete assistance to developing countries who faced the greatest challenges in fighting poverty.  Industrial development cooperation played a crucial role in raising the productivity of a country.  China would work closely with Member States to pursue a path to industrialization.  His country had already achieved seven Millennium Development Goals  and had overcome various difficulties  including lifting the living standard of its people. A.K. ABDUL MOMEN (Bangladesh)  aligning himself with the Group of 77 and China and with the Group of Least Developed Countries  said that of the two poorest regions in the world  South Asia had  “however unevenly”  moved forward in reducing the number of poor people and was expected to meet Millennium Development Goal One.  The global community would have to work closely to ensure that the projection would meet reality.  Unemployment  which could be addressed through education  was a major obstacle to eradicating poverty.  Climate change was another key factor as it was estimated that environmental degradation would lead to 1.9 billion more people entering into extreme poverty by 2050.  A strong industrial base could go a long way towards helping a country eradicate poverty  particularly a least developed country.  Bangladesh had attached great importance to the vital role of women in development and since 2009  the number of women entrepreneurs in the country had quadrupled. NANZEGUELA KONE-FOFANA (Côte d’Ivoire)  aligning herself with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  noted that several developing countries would not achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  With poverty eradication a serious concern  the Government had been determined to achieve the Goals and adopted a national development plan in 2012.  The plan included a national employment policy  as well as significant efforts to improve education and health care.  In the latter field  mothers and children had access to free health care and children received free malaria treatment up to the age of five.  Efforts under the plan had improved the lives of tens of thousands  particularly in rural areas.  Women’s empowerment was also important and policies were in place on their economic integration and to uphold their rights.  She stressed the importance of subregional and regional integration and noted energy connections with Mali  Guinea and Liberia  as well as international transport connections that boosted trade  industrialization and access to markets. TEVITA SUKA MANGISI (Tonga)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and the Group of Pacific Small Island Developing States  said that the Millennium Development Goals had been the most successful anti-poverty initiative in history.  The term “hardship” more accurately conveyed the situation in his country than the word “poverty”  as the population generally had access to food and shelter.  The negative effects of climate change posed a threat to poverty reduction efforts.  Ecosystem losses could translate directly into economic losses  and poverty eradication could thus not be decoupled from the climate change issue  a problem which disproportionately affected his country. Ms. MCKENZIE (Canada)  stating that she would keep it to the point  associated her delegation with the Group of Friends on Financial Inclusion. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-22,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gashc4108.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Rapid response to and prevention of human rights violations had the power to stop crises  from the Ebola outbreak to bloodshed in conflict hot spots around the world  the United Nations top human rights official told the Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) today  as it continued discussions on the protection and promotion of human rights  hearing from experts and almost 60 delegates participating in interactive debates on a range of issues  from the death penalty to water and sanitation. Addressing the Committee for the first time as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein presented his annual report covering the period from August 2013 to July 2014 and provided highlights of a tumultuous year on multiple fronts.  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) was currently under pressure stemming from situations that included the relentless slaughter in Syria and its spillover effects  a new wave of barbarity in Iraq  the deplorable conflict in Ukraine and bloodshed in South Sudan. “A toxic tide of discrimination and xenophobia has undermined the dignity  equality and rights of people in numerous States ” he told delegates.  “When human rights go wrong  the cost in bloodshed  in wrecked economies and humanitarian aid is titanic.” Underlining a need for a strong  resilient and relevant United Nations human rights office  he said the Office was concerned about rising inequality and the political  economic and social exclusion of marginalized groups as root causes of the unrest and conflict across the globe.  All human rights must be at the core of all United Nations work  and must strengthen the Organization’s prevention and response efforts to violations.  In that regard  early and coordinated action across the full spectrum of human rights would achieve the goal of prevention more effectively. It was also vital to integrate human rights into the response to Ebola and climate change  he stressed  pointing out that the failure of duty bearers  including States  to address people’s rights to basic goods and services  and also access to timely information  had fuelled the Ebola epidemic. The Office had seen multiple examples of Member States and their proxies directing personal attacks against special procedures mandate holders  members of commissions of inquiry and human rights officers and officials who reported shortcomings and gaps in human rights protection.  In that regard  he urged all States concerned to cooperate with efforts to bring stability and justice to their countries. Providing an overview of his Office’s activities  he said staff had demonstrated outstanding dedication during the period covered by the report  supporting 68 human rights field presences  comprising 13 stand-alone country offices  12 regional offices  components in 14 United Nations peace missions and 29 human rights advisers.  Among interventions  OHCHR personnel had been the first United Nations staff to arrive in conflict areas in Ukraine  Mali and Kyrgyzstan  as well as remote areas in the Central African Republic following conflicts. During the ensuing debate  Mr. Al Hussein thanked Member States for their words of support  telling them that despite progress  there were a number of gaps that needed to be bridged.  Taking up questions raised during the morning-long interactive dialogue in which more than 25 delegates participated  he responded to a range of issues  including attacks on human rights defenders  OHCHR funding challenges  States’ responsibilities to promote and protect human rights  and how the United Nations could best deal with the reported atrocities and “poisonous ideology” of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS). A representative of Iraq said that it was no secret that ISIL had committed horrendous crimes in areas under its control.  Regarding a proposal to send a mission to Iraq to investigate those crimes  he said his delegation hoped that the mission would fulfil its aims within its mandate. Syria’s delegate said that the High Commissioner had inherited “a burden of errors and personal grudges” from his predecessor.  The Office must conduct its work with respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  she said  calling on Mr. Al Hussein to intervene with Governments that were sheltering and financing armed terrorist groups  and to take tangible measures “to limit the calls for jihad launched by provocateurs wearing the outfit of religious men in Gulf countries”.  Addressing a volley of questions on ISIL posed by other delegates  Mr. Al Hussein said the Office was planning forthcoming measures  as parts of Iraq and Syria were under the control of that non-state actor.  Despite security constraints  the human rights component mission in Iraq was strengthening the standards in the country.  However  in Syria  he continued  the Office had not been granted entry to the country  where there were reports of sectarian and gender-based violence. Several speakers asked for advice or assistance in facing human rights challenges in their countries and regions.  Weighing in on working with national human rights institutions  a representative of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) said misperceptions and misconceptions abounded  inside and outside the OIC  calling on the OHCHR for support. Other speakers asked for the High Commissioner to weigh in on current pressing challenges.  Among many speakers who asked questions pertaining to situations in their countries  a representative of the State of Palestine asked how the Commissioner planned to deal with Israel’s non-cooperation with various United Nations human rights entities  such as Special Rapporteurs and fact-finding missions including the one on Gaza  and what steps could be taken to end Israel’s repeated violations of the United Nations Charter. On that issue  he urged all Member States to cooperate  to focus “more on the issues and less on the persons”.  Otherwise  he stressed  the international human rights system was at jeopardy. A delegate from Eritrea said the establishment of a commission of inquiry in relation to his country was a politically motivated exercise by the Human Rights Council.  “The constant creation of rapporteurs and inquiry commissions must stop ” he said  asking the Commissioner how much it had cost.  A representative of Belarus said her Government was concerned that OHCHR working methods had decreased the prestige of the body  and that her country did not recognize the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on Belarus and would not cooperate. In response  he said the Office must strictly follow the mandate established by United Nations Member States.  Noting that every State followed the instructions given by their governments in the intergovernmental meetings  his office looked for a space to find an agreement. Responding to general questions on State sovereignty  he said all Member States needed to respect international humanitarian law  while refraining from targeting minorities.  He also called upon all delegations to cooperate with the Office’s commissions of inquiry.  On more specific questions about the issue of attacks against human rights defenders and civil society organizations  Mr. Al Hussein said that many had risked their lives and the enjoyment of their freedom in the country they served.  There was  indeed  a need for change  he said. Answering questions about OHCHR policies  he said OHCHR had provided technical assistance to numerous countries on a very wide range of issues  including discrimination  the rule of law  and ending impunity  as well as on efforts to improve international human rights mechanisms.  Addressing another question  he said the Office was quite firm on the moratorium of death penalty  as no judiciary was mistake-free. On the questions related to the dire financial situation of the OHCHR  he said that even though human rights was one of the three pillars of the United Nations system  it had been allocated 87 per cent less than allocations to the peace and security pillar  and 84 per cent less than the development allocation.  With the budgetary limit  the Office looked intensively to prioritize their mandates  based on urgency. The extensive work of the Office was achieved  despite funding shortfalls that burdened the Office with significant capacity deficits.  The Office also needed a number of things  including a user-friendly website.  It was also downsizing and cutting back the activities  as it had not received sufficient regular budget funding to fully pursue its mandate  resulting in delays in solving problems.  The Office hoped to work not only with the Member States  but also with public to generate a strong support. During its afternoon meeting  the Committee held another interactive dialogue with an introductory statement by Ivan Šimonović  Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights  and presentations by : Emmanuel Decaux  Chair of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances; Ariel Dulitzky  Chair of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances; Christof Heyns  Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial  summary or arbitrary executions; and Catarina de Albuquerque  Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation. Introducing several reports by the Secretary-General  Mr. Šimonović provided an overview of economic  social and cultural rights challenges  including those facing migrants  children and adolescents.  Referring to a clutch of reports  he said the right to development should be central to the post-2015 development agenda.  He also said globalization must uphold the dignity of livelihoods and labour  including in transnational business  and of migrant workers and small-scale farmers  who sustained the globalized economy  but often remained on the margins of global value chains. He also introduced a report of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights in Iran  which called on the Government to introduce a moratorium on the use of the death penalty and to prohibit executions of juvenile offenders  as well as to create space for human rights defenders  lawyers and journalists  to release political prisoners and to establish an independent national human rights institution. Mr. Decaux said even though the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance now had 43 States parties  the phenomenon was far from disappearing.  His Committee had already engaged in dialogues with six States parties since it was set up.  During the Committee’s seventh session  it had adopted a list of items to tackle regarding Armenia  Mexico and Serbia.  Concluding  he called on all Member States to ratify the Convention  as it provided a safety net against enforced disappearances and on all States parties to fulfil their obligations and submit their reports.  Further  he appealed to all States parties to respond effectively to the new international habeas corpus procedure  to find a disappeared person in the best possible timeframe. Mr. Dulitzky began his presentation by discussing a new procedure being used to evaluate potential forced disappearances that had been adopted to express concern over disappearances taking place in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Syria.  Asking the Security Council to bring that issue to the International Criminal Court  he also made an appeal to identify new strategies to improve the search for disappeared persons  of which there were more than 43 000 ongoing cases.  Sustainable  integrated  and coordinated efforts by all stakeholders were needed  he said  calling on all States to honour their responsibilities.  Turning to the victims  he said efforts should focus on them  and that they should have a central role in designing public policies on forced disappearances.  In Argentina  the finding of activist Estela de Carlotto’s grandson after 36 years showed the kind of results that could be achieved when families of the disappeared  and the organizations that represented them  were fully supported by the State  he said.  Turning to the issue of threats and intimidation of family members  he urged all Member States to prevent and punish perpetrators.  He then said that forced disappearance was a form of terrorism  asking for an increase in accountability to shed light on that issue. Lastly  he called for the inclusion of a gender perspective in all strategies dealing with forced disappearances. Mr. Heyns said regional systems  unmanned weapons systems and the resumption of executions were among his main concerns.  Regional human rights systems were an important but underutilized part of the global protection of the right to life  he said  highlighting some examples  including that the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights had addressed the right to life through resolutions  considerations of state reports and case law  and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Inter-governmental Commission on Human Rights had been developing a thematic study.  On the use of unmanned weapons  he said the High Commissioner for Human Rights should convene an expert group to examine the application of the international human rights framework to remotely-controlled weapon systems in the context of both law enforcement and private security.  On the death penalty  he noted the resumption of executions over the last two years  with 10 countries using that practice  ran counter to the international trend of reducing executions.  Human rights were about “more than just counting bodies”  he said  noting that without reliable statistics  it would not be possible to ensure sensible policies.  “Accounting for life” — both in the sense of keeping count of life and death and in the sense of accountability — was a central part of a State’s responsibility. Ms. de Albuquerque presented her annual report  which focused on the right to participation in water and sanitation sectors.  Underlining that people had a right to take part in decision-making processes that might affect their lives  she said States had an obligation to involve people from the beginning  and to provide people with the necessary information to form an opinion.  Ensuring active  free and meaningful participation was not without difficulties  she said  noting that the biggest challenge was making sure that “everyone could realize his/her right to equal participation”.  That included addressing barriers facing marginalized individuals and groups.  Participation was a human right in itself  she said  calling on Member States to take measures to institutionalize inclusion in their work towards the realization of the human rights to water and sanitation. During the ensuing interactive dialogue  two dozen delegates raised points about situations in their countries  and asked a range of questions. Mr. Šimonović said  responding to a question from a representative of Belarus on the methodology for preparing country reports  that all delegations were welcomed to his office to be informed about it.  To a comment made by a representative of Cuba  who was speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  he thanked for his recognition of the importance of the universal peer review mechanism.  Turning to the issue of death penalty  he said that a book on arguments against that practice had been recently published. Mr. Decaux  responding to questions and comments from representatives of Switzerland  France  European Union  and Mexico  discussed different ways of strengthening the treaty bodies and the cooperation between them.  He said that he was fully in favour of a transparent platform for treaty bodies  as well as academics and NGOs to engage in dialogue.  Reprisals were a big concern for his Committee  and it was a good idea to have a focal point  perhaps within OHCHR  to deal with that matter  as well as with attacks against those who cooperated with different treaty bodies.  As for aligning the Convention with domestic laws  while the Committee could not dictate laws to States parties  it could organize workshops on how to incorporate the instrument within the parameters of a given legal system. Mr. Dulitzky said he fully shared an appeal made by representatives of Chile and Argentina with regards to the ratification of the Convention  as it would enable the Committee to receive inter-state and individual communications.  Responding to a question from a speaker from the European Union Delegation on country visits  Mr. Dulitzky said that his annual report featured a list of countries that had received a request from the Working Group.  It was also considering the possibility of preparing the report without conducting a visit  or of finding some other way to establish a dialogue with those countries without visiting them.  After expressing appreciation for comments made by a representative of Croatia  who said recent events had shown that there was a desire for international cooperation  he appealed to all countries to cooperate with those who were looking for their citizens. Turning to the issue of the working methods  raised by the delegate of the United States in relation to Crimea  Burundi and Rwanda  Mr. Dulitzky pointed out that the working methods and code of conduct of the Working Group established that communications remained confidential  saying that he would not make a statement on the countries mentioned by the United States.  However  in any situation  the Working Group used all tools available to it under its mandate.  In addition  it had the possibility in its working methods to contact both States involved  which was frequently done.  On justice and truth  he noted the need to redouble efforts.  Turning to girls and women  he said the obstacle women faced in trying to find their loved ones was not the same as men  inviting the Committee to read his report about that. Mr. Heyns responded to questions on the death penalty raised by representatives of Singapore  Pakistan and Kuwait  who commented on his report’s references to their countries.  He said that “domestic law can never trump international law”  and progressive abolition of death penalty was a global trend  adding that military courts should never have the capacity to hand out death sentences.  Responding to questions from representatives of Switzerland  Norway  Russian Federation and Brazil  as well as the European Union  he said a code of conduct regarding the use of autonomous weapons should be in line with international human rights laws.  He also said regional human rights systems were vital and by exchanging notes and referring to each other’s jurisprudences  they were strengthening each other  as well as decreasing the burden on the United Nations. Ms. de Albuquerque addressed a question from Switzerland’s delegate on best practices to promote the participation of minorities and vulnerable groups  saying that Brazil had created safe spaces for groups that had difficulties in making their voices heard.  That action had benefitted their participation in national decision-making processes.  To a comment made by Portugal’s delegate on how to address the issue of water in the post-2015 development agenda  she said concrete and targeted steps were being taken to progressively eliminate exclusion.  On corruption issues that were mentioned by Norway’s delegate  she applauded the efforts made by a Norwegian NGO in the United Republic of Tanzania to increase budget tracking to ensure that “public money is used to bring public goods”. Responding to a representative of Kenya  she expected to receive a report of her visit in July 2014 soon.  Turning to the issue of economic advantages of participation raised by Germany’s delegate  she said that it was a human right  and that economic advantages were secondary.  Turning to potential challenges facing the international community in the post-2015 development agenda in terms of water and sanitation addressed by a representative of Spain  she identified retrogression and climate change  among others.  On the issue of stigma raised by a delegate from the European Union Delegation  she said menstrual hygiene management was a stigma and taboo in many countries.  However  she noted  in countries like Kenya and Bangladesh  a way to overcome that challenge was for the Governments to include both boys and girls in the discussions on it.  Turning to a question by Slovenia’s delegate regarding structural barriers to participation  she hailed the Government’s engagement of the Roma people. During the interactive dialogue  a representative of Iran said all countries had a sovereign right to respond to reports on them  and urged that enough time be allotted for a statement to be delivered.  The representative of the Secretariat asked that a bilateral discussion be conducted on that issue. The Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. Thursday  23 October to continue its debate on human rights. Background The Third Committee met this morning to continue its consideration of the protection and promotion of human rights.  Before it were the following reports on human rights questions  including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms: documents A/69/277  A/69/121  A/69/97  A/69/214  A/69/99  A/69/336  A/69/333  A/69/287  A/69/293  A/69/268  A/69/288  A/69/266  A/69/263  A/69/261  A/69/259  A/69/295  A/69/275  A/69/302  A/69/273  A/69/274  A/69/402  A/69/272  A/69/265  A/69/294  A/69/299  A/69/335  A/69/297  A/69/269  A/69/365  A/69/286  A/69/397  A/69/276  A/69/366 and A/69/267. Included in the documentation were reports of the Secretary-General on the promotion and protection of human rights  including on: the status of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; the right to food and development; globalization; the safety of journalists; migrants; internally displaced persons; and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.  Also included was a note by the Secretary-General containing a report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the protection and promotion of the right to privacy in the context of domestic and extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of digital communications and the collection of personal data  including on a mass scale. Members also had before them documents A/69/362  A/69/306  A/69/301  A/69/398  A/69/356  A/69/307 and A/C.3/69/3  which included reports of special rapporteurs and representatives on the situation of human rights in Myanmar  Iran  the occupied Palestinian territories and Belarus.  The Committee would also consider  upon issuance  a report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth  justice  reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence (document A/69/518). Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-22,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gashc4108.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Rapid response to and prevention of human rights violations had the power to stop crises  from the Ebola outbreak to bloodshed in conflict hot spots around the world  the United Nations top human rights official told the Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) today  as it continued discussions on the protection and promotion of human rights  hearing from experts and almost 60 delegates participating in interactive debates on a range of issues  from the death penalty to water and sanitation. Addressing the Committee for the first time as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein presented his annual report covering the period from August 2013 to July 2014 and provided highlights of a tumultuous year on multiple fronts.  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) was currently under pressure stemming from situations that included the relentless slaughter in Syria and its spillover effects  a new wave of barbarity in Iraq  the deplorable conflict in Ukraine and bloodshed in South Sudan. “A toxic tide of discrimination and xenophobia has undermined the dignity  equality and rights of people in numerous States ” he told delegates.  “When human rights go wrong  the cost in bloodshed  in wrecked economies and humanitarian aid is titanic.” Underlining a need for a strong  resilient and relevant United Nations human rights office  he said the Office was concerned about rising inequality and the political  economic and social exclusion of marginalized groups as root causes of the unrest and conflict across the globe.  All human rights must be at the core of all United Nations work  and must strengthen the Organization’s prevention and response efforts to violations.  In that regard  early and coordinated action across the full spectrum of human rights would achieve the goal of prevention more effectively. It was also vital to integrate human rights into the response to Ebola and climate change  he stressed  pointing out that the failure of duty bearers  including States  to address people’s rights to basic goods and services  and also access to timely information  had fuelled the Ebola epidemic. The Office had seen multiple examples of Member States and their proxies directing personal attacks against special procedures mandate holders  members of commissions of inquiry and human rights officers and officials who reported shortcomings and gaps in human rights protection.  In that regard  he urged all States concerned to cooperate with efforts to bring stability and justice to their countries. Providing an overview of his Office’s activities  he said staff had demonstrated outstanding dedication during the period covered by the report  supporting 68 human rights field presences  comprising 13 stand-alone country offices  12 regional offices  components in 14 United Nations peace missions and 29 human rights advisers.  Among interventions  OHCHR personnel had been the first United Nations staff to arrive in conflict areas in Ukraine  Mali and Kyrgyzstan  as well as remote areas in the Central African Republic following conflicts. During the ensuing debate  Mr. Al Hussein thanked Member States for their words of support  telling them that despite progress  there were a number of gaps that needed to be bridged.  Taking up questions raised during the morning-long interactive dialogue in which more than 25 delegates participated  he responded to a range of issues  including attacks on human rights defenders  OHCHR funding challenges  States’ responsibilities to promote and protect human rights  and how the United Nations could best deal with the reported atrocities and “poisonous ideology” of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS). A representative of Iraq said that it was no secret that ISIL had committed horrendous crimes in areas under its control.  Regarding a proposal to send a mission to Iraq to investigate those crimes  he said his delegation hoped that the mission would fulfil its aims within its mandate. Syria’s delegate said that the High Commissioner had inherited “a burden of errors and personal grudges” from his predecessor.  The Office must conduct its work with respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  she said  calling on Mr. Al Hussein to intervene with Governments that were sheltering and financing armed terrorist groups  and to take tangible measures “to limit the calls for jihad launched by provocateurs wearing the outfit of religious men in Gulf countries”.  Addressing a volley of questions on ISIL posed by other delegates  Mr. Al Hussein said the Office was planning forthcoming measures  as parts of Iraq and Syria were under the control of that non-state actor.  Despite security constraints  the human rights component mission in Iraq was strengthening the standards in the country.  However  in Syria  he continued  the Office had not been granted entry to the country  where there were reports of sectarian and gender-based violence. Several speakers asked for advice or assistance in facing human rights challenges in their countries and regions.  Weighing in on working with national human rights institutions  a representative of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) said misperceptions and misconceptions abounded  inside and outside the OIC  calling on the OHCHR for support. Other speakers asked for the High Commissioner to weigh in on current pressing challenges.  Among many speakers who asked questions pertaining to situations in their countries  a representative of the State of Palestine asked how the Commissioner planned to deal with Israel’s non-cooperation with various United Nations human rights entities  such as Special Rapporteurs and fact-finding missions including the one on Gaza  and what steps could be taken to end Israel’s repeated violations of the United Nations Charter. On that issue  he urged all Member States to cooperate  to focus “more on the issues and less on the persons”.  Otherwise  he stressed  the international human rights system was at jeopardy. A delegate from Eritrea said the establishment of a commission of inquiry in relation to his country was a politically motivated exercise by the Human Rights Council.  “The constant creation of rapporteurs and inquiry commissions must stop ” he said  asking the Commissioner how much it had cost.  A representative of Belarus said her Government was concerned that OHCHR working methods had decreased the prestige of the body  and that her country did not recognize the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on Belarus and would not cooperate. In response  he said the Office must strictly follow the mandate established by United Nations Member States.  Noting that every State followed the instructions given by their governments in the intergovernmental meetings  his office looked for a space to find an agreement. Responding to general questions on State sovereignty  he said all Member States needed to respect international humanitarian law  while refraining from targeting minorities.  He also called upon all delegations to cooperate with the Office’s commissions of inquiry.  On more specific questions about the issue of attacks against human rights defenders and civil society organizations  Mr. Al Hussein said that many had risked their lives and the enjoyment of their freedom in the country they served.  There was  indeed  a need for change  he said. Answering questions about OHCHR policies  he said OHCHR had provided technical assistance to numerous countries on a very wide range of issues  including discrimination  the rule of law  and ending impunity  as well as on efforts to improve international human rights mechanisms.  Addressing another question  he said the Office was quite firm on the moratorium of death penalty  as no judiciary was mistake-free. On the questions related to the dire financial situation of the OHCHR  he said that even though human rights was one of the three pillars of the United Nations system  it had been allocated 87 per cent less than allocations to the peace and security pillar  and 84 per cent less than the development allocation.  With the budgetary limit  the Office looked intensively to prioritize their mandates  based on urgency. The extensive work of the Office was achieved  despite funding shortfalls that burdened the Office with significant capacity deficits.  The Office also needed a number of things  including a user-friendly website.  It was also downsizing and cutting back the activities  as it had not received sufficient regular budget funding to fully pursue its mandate  resulting in delays in solving problems.  The Office hoped to work not only with the Member States  but also with public to generate a strong support. During its afternoon meeting  the Committee held another interactive dialogue with an introductory statement by Ivan Šimonović  Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights  and presentations by : Emmanuel Decaux  Chair of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances; Ariel Dulitzky  Chair of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances; Christof Heyns  Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial  summary or arbitrary executions; and Catarina de Albuquerque  Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation. Introducing several reports by the Secretary-General  Mr. Šimonović provided an overview of economic  social and cultural rights challenges  including those facing migrants  children and adolescents.  Referring to a clutch of reports  he said the right to development should be central to the post-2015 development agenda.  He also said globalization must uphold the dignity of livelihoods and labour  including in transnational business  and of migrant workers and small-scale farmers  who sustained the globalized economy  but often remained on the margins of global value chains. He also introduced a report of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights in Iran  which called on the Government to introduce a moratorium on the use of the death penalty and to prohibit executions of juvenile offenders  as well as to create space for human rights defenders  lawyers and journalists  to release political prisoners and to establish an independent national human rights institution. Mr. Decaux said even though the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance now had 43 States parties  the phenomenon was far from disappearing.  His Committee had already engaged in dialogues with six States parties since it was set up.  During the Committee’s seventh session  it had adopted a list of items to tackle regarding Armenia  Mexico and Serbia.  Concluding  he called on all Member States to ratify the Convention  as it provided a safety net against enforced disappearances and on all States parties to fulfil their obligations and submit their reports.  Further  he appealed to all States parties to respond effectively to the new international habeas corpus procedure  to find a disappeared person in the best possible timeframe. Mr. Dulitzky began his presentation by discussing a new procedure being used to evaluate potential forced disappearances that had been adopted to express concern over disappearances taking place in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Syria.  Asking the Security Council to bring that issue to the International Criminal Court  he also made an appeal to identify new strategies to improve the search for disappeared persons  of which there were more than 43 000 ongoing cases.  Sustainable  integrated  and coordinated efforts by all stakeholders were needed  he said  calling on all States to honour their responsibilities.  Turning to the victims  he said efforts should focus on them  and that they should have a central role in designing public policies on forced disappearances.  In Argentina  the finding of activist Estela de Carlotto’s grandson after 36 years showed the kind of results that could be achieved when families of the disappeared  and the organizations that represented them  were fully supported by the State  he said.  Turning to the issue of threats and intimidation of family members  he urged all Member States to prevent and punish perpetrators.  He then said that forced disappearance was a form of terrorism  asking for an increase in accountability to shed light on that issue. Lastly  he called for the inclusion of a gender perspective in all strategies dealing with forced disappearances. Mr. Heyns said regional systems  unmanned weapons systems and the resumption of executions were among his main concerns.  Regional human rights systems were an important but underutilized part of the global protection of the right to life  he said  highlighting some examples  including that the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights had addressed the right to life through resolutions  considerations of state reports and case law  and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Inter-governmental Commission on Human Rights had been developing a thematic study.  On the use of unmanned weapons  he said the High Commissioner for Human Rights should convene an expert group to examine the application of the international human rights framework to remotely-controlled weapon systems in the context of both law enforcement and private security.  On the death penalty  he noted the resumption of executions over the last two years  with 10 countries using that practice  ran counter to the international trend of reducing executions.  Human rights were about “more than just counting bodies”  he said  noting that without reliable statistics  it would not be possible to ensure sensible policies.  “Accounting for life” — both in the sense of keeping count of life and death and in the sense of accountability — was a central part of a State’s responsibility. Ms. de Albuquerque presented her annual report  which focused on the right to participation in water and sanitation sectors.  Underlining that people had a right to take part in decision-making processes that might affect their lives  she said States had an obligation to involve people from the beginning  and to provide people with the necessary information to form an opinion.

Turning to the issue of death penalty  he said that a book on arguments against that practice had been recently published. Mr. Decaux  responding to questions and comments from representatives of Switzerland  France  European Union  and Mexico  discussed different ways of strengthening the treaty bodies and the cooperation between them.  He said that he was fully in favour of a transparent platform for treaty bodies  as well as academics and NGOs to engage in dialogue.  Reprisals were a big concern for his Committee  and it was a good idea to have a focal point  perhaps within OHCHR  to deal with that matter  as well as with attacks against those who cooperated with different treaty bodies.

After expressing appreciation for comments made by a representative of Croatia  who said recent events had shown that there was a desire for international cooperation  he appealed to all countries to cooperate with those who were looking for their citizens. Turning to the issue of the working methods  raised by the delegate of the United States in relation to Crimea  Burundi and Rwanda  Mr. Dulitzky pointed out that the working methods and code of conduct of the Working Group established that communications remained confidential  saying that he would not make a statement on the countries mentioned by the United States.  However  in any situation  the Working Group used all tools available to it under its mandate.

He also said regional human rights systems were vital and by exchanging notes and referring to each other’s jurisprudences  they were strengthening each other  as well as decreasing the burden on the United Nations. Ms. de Albuquerque addressed a question from Switzerland’s delegate on best practices to promote the participation of minorities and vulnerable groups  saying that Brazil had created safe spaces for groups that had difficulties in making their voices heard.  That action had benefitted their participation in national decision-making processes.  To a comment made by Portugal’s delegate on how to address the issue of water in the post-2015 development agenda  she said concrete and targeted steps were being taken to progressively eliminate exclusion.  On corruption issues that were mentioned by Norway’s delegate  she applauded the efforts made by a Norwegian NGO in the United Republic of Tanzania to increase budget tracking to ensure that “public money is used to bring public goods”. Responding to a representative of Kenya  she expected to receive a report of her visit in July 2014 soon.  Turning to the issue of economic advantages of participation raised by Germany’s delegate  she said that it was a human right  and that economic advantages were secondary.  Turning to potential challenges facing the international community in the post-2015 development agenda in terms of water and sanitation addressed by a representative of Spain  she identified retrogression and climate change  among others.  On the issue of stigma raised by a delegate from the European Union Delegation  she said menstrual hygiene management was a stigma and taboo in many countries.  However  she noted  in countries like Kenya and Bangladesh  a way to overcome that challenge was for the Governments to include both boys and girls in the discussions on it.  Turning to a question by Slovenia’s delegate regarding structural barriers to participation  she hailed the Government’s engagement of the Roma people. During the interactive dialogue  a representative of Iran said all countries had a sovereign right to respond to reports on them  and urged that enough time be allotted for a statement to be delivered.  The representative of the Secretariat asked that a bilateral discussion be conducted on that issue. The Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. Thursday  23 October to continue its debate on human rights. Background The Third Committee met this morning to continue its consideration of the protection and promotion of human rights.  Before it were the following reports on human rights questions  including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms: documents A/69/277  A/69/121  A/69/97  A/69/214  A/69/99  A/69/336  A/69/333  A/69/287  A/69/293  A/69/268  A/69/288  A/69/266  A/69/263  A/69/261  A/69/259  A/69/295  A/69/275  A/69/302  A/69/273  A/69/274  A/69/402  A/69/272  A/69/265  A/69/294  A/69/299  A/69/335  A/69/297  A/69/269  A/69/365  A/69/286  A/69/397  A/69/276  A/69/366 and A/69/267. Included in the documentation were reports of the Secretary-General on the promotion and protection of human rights  including on: the status of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; the right to food and development; globalization; the safety of journalists; migrants; internally displaced persons; and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.  Also included was a note by the Secretary-General containing a report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the protection and promotion of the right to privacy in the context of domestic and extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of digital communications and the collection of personal data  including on a mass scale. Members also had before them documents A/69/362  A/69/306  A/69/301  A/69/398  A/69/356  A/69/307 and A/C.3/69/3  which included reports of special rapporteurs and representatives on the situation of human rights in Myanmar  Iran  the occupied Palestinian territories and Belarus.

2014-10-22,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gadis3508.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. It was “ironic” that the weapons that propelled and sustained conflicts came from areas that enjoyed peace  a delegate told the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) as it continued its thematic debate on conventional weapons. Drawing attention to what he called double standards in the global arms trade  the representative of Pakistan said that only four countries accounted for two thirds of those exports  while major importers were in the developing world.   As the total United Nations budget amounted to a paltry 3 per cent of the global military expenditure  he said  33 times that was being spent on breeding  exacerbating and maintaining conflict than in preventing it. Many speakers drew attention to the coming entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty  with the representative of Djibouti saying that “a new page in United Nations history” had been written that highlighted the dynamism of multilateralism.  Arms transfers were at the heart of Africa’s destabilization  with conflicts costing the continent billions every year  notwithstanding the human toll. The representative of Ethiopia concurred that the negative impacts of conventional weapons were immense  saying they hampered hard-won peace gains as well as social and economic development.  Over the years  many violent conflicts in Africa had been fuelled by those weapons  resulting in wider instability.  Those “hotbeds of tension” showed that peace and stability were “anything but a given”  said the representative of Senegal.  The situation in the Sahel remained a particular concern.  To curb small arms and light weapons  West Africa had adopted an initiative to trigger “synergies of action ” he said. Speaking on behalf of the African Group  the representative of Nigeria underscored the importance of a reduction in military spending  urging countries to devote those resources to development  notably in the fight against poverty and disease.  Turning to the Arms Trade Treaty  he said that its implementation should be done in a balanced manner to ensure that the interests of all States were protected  and not only those of the arms-producing nations. While weapons of mass destruction had dominated much of the global security and disarmament agenda over the last few decades  noted the representative of the Republic of Korea  the illicit transfer and use of conventional weapons continued to engender insecurity and conflict around the world.  Adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty was an important milestone  requiring States for the first time to consider humanitarian and human rights consequences when exporting conventional weapons. The continued impact of weapons on civilians “shook the legal foundation” that was at the centre of conventional disarmament  stressed the representative of Costa Rica.  As President of the Fifth Meeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions  she said those weapons should not be part of a State’s modern arsenal.  Despite the legal framework  the use of cluster munitions could be seen in the conflicts in Syria and eastern Ukraine. Sharing a perspective from Latin America  the representative of Colombia noted that his country was heavily affected by conventional weapons and supported the full and effective implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty.  While the right of States to self-defence must also be ensured  there should be a differentiation between lawful and illicit weapons use. During the meeting  draft resolutions were tabled on the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa; Standing Advisory Committee of the United Nations on questions of security in Central Africa; Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons; the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons; and preventing and combating illicit brokering activities. Also speaking during the debate were representatives of India  Equatorial Guinea on behalf of the Economic Community of Central African States  United States  Egypt on behalf of the Arab Group  Cuba  Belarus  France  Slovenia  Iraq  Japan  China  Bangladesh  the Netherlands  Lithuania  Kazakhstan  Finland  South Africa  Republic of Moldova  Myanmar  Lao People’s Democratic Republic  Switzerland  Romania  Austria  Australia  and Spain. The First Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. tomorrow  23 October to conclude its thematic debate on conventional weapons. Background The First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) met today to continue its thematic debate on conventional weapons.  For more background  see Press Release GA/DIS/3497. Statements SIDDHARTHA NATH (India)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that the full and effective implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons and the International Tracing Instrument was a priority for his country  particularly with regard to combating terrorism and transnational crime.  On that issue  India welcomed the successful conclusion of the Fifth Biennial Meeting of States on the Programme of Action and the consensus adoption of its outcome document.  The Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons  he said  remained the only forum of a universal character that brought together all the main users and producers of certain conventional weapons  ensuring that the instruments that emerged had a greater prospect of making a “meaningful impact on the ground”. India  he went on  supported the vision of a world free of the threat of landmines and was committed to their eventual elimination.  His country had discontinued the production of non-detectable anti-personnel landmines and observed a moratorium on their transfer.  Further  it had participated in the expert level meeting for the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons focused on lethal autonomous weapons systems in May and supported continued discussions in connection with that Convention in 2015  in line with its mandate.  The country felt that lethal autonomous weapons should be assessed  not only from the view of their compatibility with international law  including international humanitarian law  but also on their impact on international security.  The Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons should emerge strengthened from ongoing discussions  resulting in their increased systemic control. ANATOLIO NDONG MBA (Equatorial Guinea)  speaking on behalf of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS)  said that every effort was needed by the international community to create a world of peace and concord.  In that context  on behalf of the Community  he presented a draft resolution on the Standing Advisory Committee of the United Nations on questions of security in Central Africa.  He said the solution to conflict was through negotiations and peaceful means  and he reaffirmed the determination to join efforts made by the United Nations to combat the evils afflicting those countries  which included some of the world’s greatest challenges  such as Ebola. He sought full support for the draft resolution. ROBERT WOOD (United States)  welcoming the coming entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty  said the instrument must operate in an open  transparent and inclusive manner.  “We need to recognize that States are at different stages in developing the national control systems required by the Treaty and in being able to sign and/or ratify it ” he said.  States that had committed to it needed to be able to participate in its operation “to the maximum extent possible”.  The Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons was an important instrument that had been able to bring together States with diverse national security concerns.  Turning to anti-personnel landmines  he said the United States this year had announced several important changes to its policy  including that it would not produce or otherwise acquire any anti-personnel munitions that were not compliant with the Mine Ban Convention.  That included replacing such munitions as they expired in the coming years.  On 23 September  the United States had announced that it was aligning its anti-personnel landmine policy outside the Korean peninsula with that Convention’s key requirements. He said the United States was the largest financial supporter of humanitarian mine action and remained committed to eliminating at-risk conventional weapons and munitions.  He urged Member States to implement the United Nations Programme of Action and the International Tracing Instrument.  Due to instability in the Middle East and Africa  terrorists had gained access to Man Portable Air Defence Systems  which threatened civil and military aviation worldwide.  His country was cooperating with partners to secure those missiles. CHUKA UDEDIBIA (Nigeria)  speaking on behalf of the Group of African States  welcomed the successful convening of the Fifth Biennial Meeting of States on the Programme of Action.  He noted that international cooperation and assistance was essential to the Programme’s full implementation.  The Programme and the instruments that emerged from its review were key to addressing issues of conventional weapons and ensuring sustainable development in Africa.  One important confidence-building measure would be a reduction in military spending  he said  urging countries to devote those resources to development  in particular  to the fight against poverty and disease.  The Group also welcomed the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty as that created a legally binding instrument for the illicit transfer.  The Treaty’s implementation should be done in a balanced manner to ensure that the interests of all States were protected  and not just those of the weapon-producing States. He said the African Group acknowledged that the unregulated flow of arms gave access to non-State actors and  as such  it urged ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty by the major weapons suppliers.  The Group reiterated the critical importance of political will in addressing the issue of small arms and light weapons  and believed that international deliberations should “enhance the cost of peace”.  He called for assistance to States in controlling those weapons  saying that efforts in Africa should correspond to efforts in other regions.  With that  he introduced a draft resolution on the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa.  While there had been overwhelming support in the past on this resolution  he encouraged Member States to redouble their efforts in support of this draft. AMR FATHI ALJOWAILY (Egypt)  speaking on behalf of the Arab Group  welcomed the successful holding of the Fifth Biennial Meeting on the implementation of the Programme of Action  and noted the Group’s participation and recommitment to that process.  The Group also appreciated efforts towards the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty  and urged the international community to ensure that its implementation was in consonance with the United Nations Charter and respected the right of each State to self-determination and to the export and import of conventional weapons. The Group also emphasized the sovereign right of countries to keep those weapons in line with their security and self-defence needs.  He voiced the Group’s concern about the use of ordnance and landmines  which were still causing material damages and obstructing development in some Arab States.  The countries responsible for their use must compensate the affected States. IVIAN DEL SOL DOMINGUEZ (Cuba) said the “cost” of small and light weapons was great  but at the same time  she defended States’ rights to manufacture and import those weapons.  She called for more stringent measures to control the illicit trade  as that was seriously compromising people’s lives.  Thus  more concrete efforts were needed to promote and strengthen international cooperation.  The underlying causes leading to the scourge must be addressed.  The world community had had a historic opportunity during negotiations on the Arms Trade Treaty  but the final text favoured exporting States.  Nevertheless  strict compliance with that text and related protocols was crucial to its success  and negotiations should continue in order to end asymmetric capabilities between developed and developing States. VLADIMIR GERASIMOVICH (Belarus) affirmed that the illegal trade in small arms and light weapons was a security priority of his country.  Belarus had scrupulously implemented its commitments in that area  particularly in connection with the United Nations Programme of Action.  The country had a successful legal foundation governing the control of small arms and light weapons and had made good contributions in that area  including control of its borders.  It was unacceptable for those weapons to fall into the hands of non-State actors  he said  pointing to the need to control their licenses.  His country also supported efforts to improve stockpile management  as that was important to combating illegal trade.  Since 2007  Belarus had implemented a joint project with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the United Nations Development Programme to stop the modernization of small arms and light weapons at facilities run by the Government’s Defence Ministry.  He thanked all countries involved in that project as well as the European Union for their financial contributions towards that end. JEAN-HUGUES SIMON-MICHEL (France) said small arms and light weapons were a serious impediment to the most fragile States.  The speed with which the Arms Trade Treaty was coming into force reflected the importance the international community attached to the matter.  France supported Geneva as the host of its secretariat  he said  adding that implementation of the Treaty was crucial.  In view of that  France  in partnership with African countries  had organized a seminar on implementation  and was planning similar initiatives.  France also would hold consultations in the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons to strengthen that process.  The text of its proposed resolution would take into account recent developments  and France hoped to achieve consensus.  He urged the cessation of the use in Syria of cluster munitions. BOŠTJAN JERMAN (Slovenia)  associating with the European Union  expressed his satisfaction at the outcome of the “race to first 50” ratifications of the Arms Trade Treaty.  Reaching that goal demonstrated the international support for the first treaty regulating international trade in conventional weapons  technology and equipment.  Looking forward to the First Conference of States Parties  Slovenia supported an inclusive approach that enabled wide participation of States and civil society.  The next challenge would be the race to the second 50 ratifications.  He called on all States that had not done so to ratify the Treaty.  Regarding anti-personnel mines  Slovenia welcomed the successful conclusion of the Maputo Review Conference  which saw the adoption of the Maputo Declaration and plan of action and the decision related to implementation machinery.  His delegation would continue to support a world free of anti-personnel mines by acting through the International Trust Fund for enhancing human security.  His delegation also fully supported the draft resolution on the Mine Ban Convention. SARMAD MUWAFAQ MOHAMMED AL-TAIE (Iraq)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Arab Group  reaffirmed his commitments on small arms and light weapons and stressed the importance of measures to control their illicit trade.  Iraq suffered immensely from such weapons  he said  adding that the affected land could not be used for development.  Despite the difficult circumstances  Iraq had eliminated cluster munitions and mines left since 2003 with the help of international organizations.  The task was fraught with difficulties  particularly concerning pollution  and Iraq was doing its utmost to help survivors and other victims.  He sought the cooperation of global organizations in the search for uranium weapons and in addressing their effects. TOSHIO SANO (Japan) said the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty provided positive impetus for the Programme of Action  which remained an important tool to address the illicit trade because it covered a wider range of issues including marking  tracing and stockpile management.  Both anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions were major causes of serious humanitarian harm  and they not only posed grave dangers and harm to civilians during and after conflicts  but could also leave a lasting socio-economic impact for many years or even decades.  He was deeply concerned by reports that anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions had recently been used  which lead to the belief that those two conventions should become universal. SUN LEI (China) said that the main legal framework dealing with the humanitarian issues in the field of arms control was the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons  which had played an irreplaceable role in connection with the devastating impact of anti-personnel landmines and other conventional weapons.  As a full Contracting Party to the Convention and its five Protocols  China would  as always  strictly implement its obligations in that regard and remain committed to enhancing the Convention’s effectiveness and universality.  While promoting the domestic implementation work  China had been actively dedicated to international mine clearance assistance.  The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons contributed to complicated causes  thus calling for a holistic approach  which should also address both the root causes and symptoms.  The international community should strengthen cooperation within the United Nations as the main channel  and ensure the full and effective implementation of the Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons.  Meanwhile  each State should strengthen its capacity-building and take on the primary responsibility for eradicating illicit trade. IBRAHIMA SORY SYLLA (Senegal)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  highlighted the “hotbeds of tension” that were permeating throughout the world  particularly in Middle East and Africa  which showed that peace and stability were “anything but a given”.  The situation in the Sahel remained a particular concern for the entire sub-Saharan region.  In order to confront those challenges  the West African region had adopted an initiative to trigger “synergies of action” to curb small arms and light weapons  which posed a genuine threat to international peace and security.  As a member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  which in 2006 had a Convention on Small Arms and Light Weapons  Senegal welcomed the positive momentum accompanying the coming entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty.  He urged a balanced approach to implementation to ensure the needs of all States were taken into account and not just those of weapon-producing ones.  On combating anti-personnel mines  he said the implementation of the Mine Ban Treaty was a priority and called for enhanced technical and financial assistance to implement mine clearance programmes. MIGUEL CAMILO RUIZ (Colombia)  noting that his country was heavily affected by the types of weapons being discussed  supported full and effective implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty.  A key lesson from history was that weapons in the hands of non-State actors led to crimes against humanity and genocide.  Colombia was in the process of ratifying the Treaty  and stressed the role of international cooperation in ensuring its full implementation.  While the right of States to self-defence must also be ensured  there should be a differentiation between lawful and illicit weapons use.  Colombia engaged at the international  hemispheric and regional levels to achieve that objective.  He introduced the draft resolution on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. FARUK HOSSAIN (Bangladesh)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  welcomed the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty  highlighting that the unregulated trade in conventional arms had been horrific and killed millions of innocent civilians.  He hoped the Treaty would bring further accountability and transparency to the global arms trade and reduce human suffering.  Nevertheless  several major arms-producing  exporting and importing States had not yet ratified it  he noted  adding that the sooner the big players embraced the Treaty  the greater the likelihood of achieving its aims.  Transparency in armaments could build confidence among States  and help prevent excessive or destabilizing accumulations of arms  which often led to conflicts.  For its part  Bangladesh routinely reported on the seven categories in the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms and stressed the importance of the effective implementation of the three related resolutions adopted in the sixty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly  he noted. THEO PETERS (Netherlands) said implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty was what would really matter.  Regarding lethal autonomous weapons systems  he was pleased that a concerted effort had begun by both States and civil society.  International law and international humanitarian law was the framework for the legality of those weapon systems  and his delegation would continue to participate in those discussions and advocate for a new mandate within the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.  Small arms and light weapons were still responsible for most arms-related casualties worldwide and remained real weapons of mass destruction.  The Biennial Meeting of States showed mixed results  and the Netherlands would like to see clear references to the synergy between the Arms Trade Treaty  stockpile management  United Nations Security Council resolutions  and assistance in technology transfers.  Regarding the Mine Ban Treaty  he recalled the agreement by States parties to clear all anti-personnel mines before 2025.  During the Meeting of States parties on the Cluster Munitions Convention  it was clear that the main challenges were achieving the treaty’s universalization and ensuring the non-use of those weapons. His country was appalled by the continued use of those weapons in populated areas by the Syrian regime.  It was also concerned about a report of their use in South Sudan  Ukraine  and by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS). ZAMIR AKRAM (Pakistan) said that  notwithstanding the focus on mass destruction potential of nuclear weapons maintained primarily for deterrence  was the widespread use of conventional weapons  which fuelled conflict and destabilized States and societies.  Ironically  the weapons that propelled and sustained conflicts came from areas that enjoyed peace.  Only four countries accounted for two thirds of global arms exports  while major importers were in the developing countries.  Yet another irony was that the total United Nations budget amounted to a paltry 3 per cent of the world’s military expenditure  and hence  the world was spending around 33 times more on breeding  exacerbating and maintaining conflict than in preventing it.  Another disturbing trend was the development of new types of weapons  such as lethal autonomous weapons  he said  adding that States currently developing and using them could not afford to be complacent that such capabilities would not proliferate. The use of armed drones  he went on  was characterized by a lack of transparency  proportionality  responsibility and accountability.  In the absence of credible information against the target individuals  their use was tantamount to extrajudicial killings since no due process of law was followed. He welcomed the Arms Trade Treaty as the first step towards regulating trade and transfer of conventional weapons and expected that the Treaty would be implemented in a non-discriminatory manner.  An exclusive focus on managing the effects of the arms trade without adequately addressing its causes did not offer a comprehensive solution.  The Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons provided an ideal platform to deal with the subject of cluster munitions since it harmonized the genuine humanitarian concerns with the security imperatives of States. AIDAS SUNELAITIS (Lithuania)  associating with the European Union  said the easy access to small arms and light weapons only prolonged conflicts and increased the chances of relapse.  The coming entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty would no doubt promote a more responsible global arms trade; however  more needed to be done.  To that end  Lithuania appreciated the efforts of Mexico in hosting preparatory discussions ahead of the Conference of Parties.  Lithuania welcomed a civil-society-led mechanism  which had proved effective in the areas of cluster munitions and anti-personnel landmines.  Looking ahead  the international community should step up efforts to determine implementation measures for the Programme of Action.  The action plan should be complemented by the active use of other instruments.  He went on to highlight the illegal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and that country’s decision to suspend its participation in the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty.  As such  his country was concerned at the diminishing “overall level of trust and confidence” in Europe.  He condemned the Russian Federation’s decision to abandon that agreement and called on the country to stop the flow of weapons to Ukraine  secure its borders and end all support to illegally armed groups. MARITZA CHAN (Costa Rica) expressed her deep concern about the continued impact of the use of weapons on civilians  which shook the legal foundation that was at the centre of the conventional disarmament.  Costa Rica  which had served as the President of the Fifth Meeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions  welcomed the first cluster-munition-free subregion in Central America as well as the accession to the Convention by Belize.  Those weapons should not be part of a modern State’s arsenal.  Despite the legal framework  their use could be seen in the conflicts in Syria and eastern Ukraine.  As such  Costa Rica called for universalization of the Convention as the only framework through which to address the issue.  Costa Rica was also concerned by the use of explosive weapons in densely populated areas and its pervasive impact on civilian and infrastructure.  The potential damage that could be caused by armed drones should also be addressed through international law. Concerning the Arms Trade Treaty  she believed it would be effective in promoting accountability.  The impact of illicit arms flows on development and its contributions to transnational organized crimes were a daily reality  she said  stressing the need to create synergies between that Treaty and related instruments  such as the Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons.  Discussions to strengthen transparency and regulation on proliferation of armed drones should be addressed and States should be held accountable for their use.  Costa Rica believed that environmental and public health challenges created by toxic remnants should be addressed and the use of depleted uranium banned.  It remained dedicated to strengthening conventional disarmament’s legal foundation. ISRAIL TILEGEN (Kazakhstan) called for effective measures to monitor the implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty  including the “grey areas”.  While countries had a sovereign right to self-defence  illicit trade in small arms and light weapons must be controlled through concerted international action.  He highlighted his country’s role in promoting disarmament in the region through its leadership of and participation in various initiatives.  Referring to countries emerging from conflict  he said they required assistance to further the goal of disarmament. Mr. JARUIAHO (Finland)  associating with the European Union  said that the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty served as a testimony of the willingness of the international community to regulate “irresponsible” arms trade.  As the Treaty was to be implemented at the national level with national responsibility  it would have an impact on the lives of millions of people.  To meet the goal of universality  all countries  both big and small  must ratify it.  Calling for the exploration of further synergies between that Treaty and the United Nations Programme of Action  he said the former instrument would contribute positively toward the implementation of the latter after the Treaty’s entry into force.  On landmines  he highlighted Finland’s annual contribution of 6 million euros towards mine clearance.  His country also was in full compliance with the Convention on Cluster Munitions. CHANTELLE NAIDOO (South Africa) believed that the Arms Trade Treaty filled a gap in the global conventional arms control system.  Central to its implementation was effective national conventional arms transfer and control legislation  official guidelines and practical enforcement measures.  South Africa was concerned about the humanitarian impact of cluster munitions and was fully committed to implementing the Convention.  Her delegation supported the destruction of cluster munitions stocks  in compliance with the Convention  and called upon all States to condemn those weapons’ use.  South Africa believed that the United Nations Programme of Action represented the central set of undertakings to prevent  combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.  However  challenges remained.  In many States  for example  the basic elements of national stockpile-management-related measures still needed to be implemented.  She added that without international assistance  many of the issues raised by States  such as civilian displacements  threats to sustainable development  and poverty eradication would never be addressed. BELACHEW GUJUBO GUTULO (Ethiopia)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said the negative impacts of conventional weapons were immense  hampering hard-won peace gains as well as social and economic development.  Over the years  many violent conflicts were fuelled in the African continent by those weapons  resulting in wider instability.  That required strong global cooperation on devising international instruments as well as effective monitoring mechanisms.  It was crucial for all States to coordinate efforts on the Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons.  Ethiopia also suffered from landmines left from the 1930s  hampering lives and livelihoods  he said  adding that it was among the first countries to have signed the Mine Ban Convention  which was among the most widely accepted disarmament treaties.  Among the programmes undertaken by his country was gender-sensitive training to highlight awareness of the mine threat. AHN YOUNG-JIP (Republic of Korea) said the illicit transfer and use of conventional weapons had continued to engender insecurity and conflict across the world  while weapons of mass destruction had dominated much of the global security and disarmament agenda for the last few decades.  The adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty marked an important milestone  requiring States for the first time to consider humanitarian and human rights consequences when exporting conventional weapons.  The adoption of resolution 2117 (2013)  the first ever resolution exclusively dedicated to small arms and light weapons by the Security Council  was also meaningful.  The Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons had served as an essential foundation of conventional disarmament and arms control for the past three decades  while maintaining the delicate balance between humanitarian principles and legitimate and indispensable security concerns.  A balanced and equitable approach towards developing a common understanding on the relevant technology and their implications was vital. VLAD LUPAN (Republic of Moldova)  associating with the European Union  welcomed the coming entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty and said his country had started the ratification process and expected to conclude that procedure as soon as possible.  Today more than ever  the international community should focus on a combination of global and regional conventional arms control arrangements  as the European situation showed.  A genuine security  progress in arms control and disarmament could be achieved if a complex set of measures was taken at all levels — international  regional and national.  For that reason  he would welcome early progress and results on a conventional arms control agreement in Europe. Existing developments  particularly in and around Ukraine  he said  posed a serious test for the arms control instruments and toolboxes of the United Nations and regional organizations.  Efforts  therefore  should focus on the implementation and strengthening of the existing commitments.  A functional Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe  known as the CFE Treaty  would have been a valuable asset  if appropriate political will had been displayed to dispel concerns and defuse tensions  thereby contributing to stabilization in and around Ukraine. YE GYAW MRA (Myanmar) said production and trading of conventional arms  their parts and components should be carefully maintained between Governments or entities duly authorized by Governments for legitimate use.  Every State had the right to import  export or even manufacture conventional arms  their parts and components for its own security needs.  However  those countries also had the responsibility to prevent such arms falling into the wrong hands.  Highlighting recent national efforts to build capacity in small arms control  he said the United Nations Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons was a significant multilateral framework.  Adequate and sustainable international cooperation and assistance  particularly in the area of capacity-building  was of paramount importance for developing countries to fulfil their commitments. MAYTHONG THAMMAVONGSA (Lao People’s Democratic Republic)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  said his country’s strong support and active participation in the work of international conventional weapons disarmament was due to its very traumatic experience and history.  The Lao People’s Democratic Republic had been recorded as one of the most heavily bombed countries on Earth per capita.  Furthermore  unexploded ordnances from the Indo-China war continued to kill and maim innocent people  creating a huge impact on socio-economic development.  Clearance of such armaments was very expensive and time-consuming and compromised the right to life.  As well  the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons had caused great concern for many countries  he said  urging concerted efforts for the international community. SAADA DAHER HASSAN (Djibouti)  associating her delegation with the Non-Aligned Movement  the African Group  and the Arab Group  said a new page in United Nations history had been written which highlighted the dynamism of multilateralism.  The transfer of arms was at the heart of the destabilization of Africa  with conflicts costing the continent billions every year  notwithstanding the human toll.  Thanking Mexico for hosting the first Conference of States Parties in 2015  she said that it was urgent to establish the modalities of the Arms Trade Treaty secretariat  taking into account geographic balances.  Small arms and light weapons were the most deadly weapons in the world  and while no continent was spared  Africa had suffered greatly.  More than ever  the international community must redouble its efforts to step up the application of the Programme of Action and strengthen regional and international cooperation.  Quoting former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan  she said  “without peace there can be no progress; without progress there can be no peace.” CHUKA UDEDIBIA (Nigeria)  speaking in his national capacity  said the increasing spate of threats to national and international security from illicitly acquired conventional arms required a greater articulation of the role of conventional weapons vis-à-vis the security of States  people and territories.  Nigeria faced enormous costs of terror fuelled by illicit acquisition and circulation of conventional arms  with the terrorist group Boko Haram having killed over 13 000 people and destroyed whole communities in the affected areas.  Over the past decade  his Government had been calling for non-transfer of small arms and light weapons to non-State actors and unauthorized end users.  Thus  Nigeria was gratified that the Arms Trade Treaty would effectively enter into force on 24 December of this year.  The next challenge was to ensure its universality.  Arms producers and brokers whose weapons ended up in illicit hands must be held to account.  It was important to plug all possible loopholes against conventional terror through the establishment of a legally binding international instrument on illicit brokering in small arms and light weapons in general. URS SCHMID (Switzerland) said that efforts made to meet the challenges posed by small arms and light weapons were as crucial as those taken against weapons of mass destruction.  The ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty underlined the importance that States attached to its rapid entry into force.  Thanking Mexico for hosting the first Conference of States Parties in 2015  he said that Switzerland would contribute to the process by hosting a preparatory meeting.  Nevertheless  ensuring quality implementation would require States to act throughout the year and not just at annual conferences.  Furthermore  the secretariat must be established in a country in which weapon importing and exporting States from the north and south had a presence.  To that end  Switzerland had offered to host the secretariat in Geneva.  He also welcomed the final document of the Fifth Biennial Meeting of States to Consider Implementation of the Programme of Assistance  noting that his country sought to bolster the capacity of States requiring assistance by lending expertise in life cycle management and in the secondment of experts. NARCISA DACIANA VLĂDULESCU (Romania)  aligning her delegation with the European Union  urged countries that had not done so  to sign and ratify the Arms Trade Treaty as soon as possible.  Her country was ready to offer all assistance to States in that direction.  Its rapid coming into force testified to the reality that sustained and committed international action could produce results.  She stressed the importance of ensuring the universality of the Treaty in order to achieve its objectives  stating that Romania looked forward to cooperating with the international community towards the instrument’s full implementation. THOMAS HAJNOCZI (Austria)  associating himself with the European Union  noted that his country was Chair of the Human Security Network which promoted a people-centred international response to international security manners.  That approach was essential in the prevention of human suffering and must remain at the heart of that group’s efforts.  He also highlighted the “disproportionate” impact of armed conflict on women  noting that gender implications deserved more attention in the political debate and should be included in all disarmament efforts.  As a candidate to host the Arms Trade Treaty secretariat  Austria could offer a wealth of expertise and carry out its duties in a transparent and effective way.  He also called for the universalization of both the Mine Ban Convention and Cluster Munitions Convention.  The use of cluster munitions in Ukraine was of concern  and he called on the international community to refrain from the use of those “indiscriminate” weapons  particularly in populated areas.  Furthermore  there was a need to explore ways to better implement the existing framework. JOHN QUINN (Australia) said that establishing a functional Arms Trade Treaty architecture  including an effective secretariat  was a key step.  His country was committed to assisting States in implementation  and for that purpose had contributed $2 million to the United Nations Trust Facility Supporting Cooperation on Arms Regulation.  Together with the Republic of Korea  his delegation would be presenting the biennial resolution on preventing and combating illicit brokering activities.  The Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons demonstrated its continued relevance this year as a multilateral mechanism to explore emerging issues related to conventional weapons that were excessively injurious or had indiscriminate effects.  His country remained committed to addressing the threat posed by the proliferation of conventional arms  and urged the world community to work together to reduce the impact of those weapons  which hampered development and seriously threatened stability and security. ISMAEL HERRAIZ (Spain)  highlighting the threats posed by small arms and light weapons  said the international community must demonstrate special and sustained efforts on the matter.  The Arms Trade Treaty represented a major milestone in conventional disarmament  he said  adding that implementation and universality were central elements of achieving its objectives.  Greater efforts must be made to regulate the legal transactions of weapons and to prevent their illicit trade  he said  adding that the issue of ammunition must be included in instruments and deliberations.  The humanitarian considerations that inspired recent conventions must prevail over any economic or military benefits that may accrue therefrom. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-22,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gal3485.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. As the Sixth Committee (Legal) took up criminal accountability of United Nations officials and experts on mission  speakers agreed that such personnel must not be able to commit crimes with impunity  but held accountable if the Organization were to maintain its credibility. Israel’s representative said that such crimes undermined the United Nations’ mandate  especially with respect to relations with local populations.  Member States should take appropriate national action to ensure that such crimes were not met with impunity. Indeed  if such serious violations were not prosecuted  underscored the representative of the Republic of Korea  the Organization might create the false signal that its officials and experts could improperly abuse immunities for private benefit. India’s representative concurred  noting that Member States must ensure that their laws had adequate provisions for prosecuting any such conduct of their nationals who served as United Nations officials or experts on mission abroad. However  the delegate of South Africa  speaking for the African Group  pointed out that while some Member States had expressed preference that the host State play a predominant role  the African Group favoured emphasis on the role of the State of nationality of the alleged perpetrator. In that context  El Salvador’s delegate stressed that establishing who should have competence for those serious crimes was an important step for States.  It would not always be necessary to change the description of the crime and expressly include officials and experts on mission  he said  since most States already considered serious crimes to be punishable by law  irrespective of who committed them. Thailand’s representative suggested that one way to bring offenders to justice and end impunity was for host States and troop-contributing States to cooperate through treaties and arrangements on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters. Delegations also pointed out that it was equally important for States addressing such criminal misconduct to report back to the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs on their actions.  The representative of Norway  speaking for the Nordic countries  found the low rate of feedback on such actions troubling.  The General Assembly  then  had no realistic basis for assessing the extent to which States carried out investigations of serious allegations of criminal conduct. Echoing that  the representative of the United States suggested that the Organization provide a more systematic way for States to report on the outcome of such referrals in the future. Also speaking were representatives of Iran (for the Non-Aligned Movement)  Costa Rica (for the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC))  New Zealand (also for Australia and Canada)  Russian Federation  Ethiopia  Malaysia  Viet Nam  Morocco  Algeria  Nigeria and the Delegation of the European Union. The Sixth Committee (Legal) would next meet at 10 a.m. Thursday  23 October  to hear from the President of the General Assembly and consider the effects of armed conflicts on treaties  as well as the responsibility of international organizations. It would also take action on draft resolutions to grant Observer Status in the General Assembly for several organizations. Background The Sixth Committee (Legal) today would begin consideration of Criminal accountability of United Nations officials and experts on mission (document A/69/210). Statements HOSSEIN GHARIBI (Iran)  speaking for the Non-Aligned Movement  said its member States contributed over 88 per cent of the peacekeeping personnel in the field.  At the same time  they were the major recipients of those peacekeeping missions.  He stressed that all United Nations peacekeeping personnel should continue to perform their duties in a manner that preserved the image credibility  impartiality and integrity of the Organization.  It was also important to maintain a policy of zero tolerance in addressing all cases of sexual exploitation and abuse committed by peacekeeping personnel. The comprehensive strategy on assistance and support to victims of sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations staff and related personnel  which had been adopted by General Assembly resolution 62/214  would help mitigate the suffering of those victims as well as offer social support  legal services and medical attention  among other things  he said.  It was necessary to implement  without delay  General Assembly resolution 61/291  which amended the revised draft model Memorandum of Understanding.  That process would strengthen accountability mechanisms and contribute to guarantee due process in investigations of acts of sexual exploitation and abuse.  However  it was still premature to discuss a draft convention on criminal accountability.  For the time being  the Committee’s work must focus on substantive matters and leave matters of form for a subsequent stage. KINGSLEY MAMABOLO (South Africa)  speaking for the African Group  supported the Organization’s zero tolerance policy concerning criminal conduct  particularly that involving sexual abuse and exploitation  committed by United Nations officials or experts on mission.  However  the existence of jurisdictional gaps in ensuring accountability had led to criminality  especially in situations where the host State was unable to exercise its criminal jurisdiction with respect to an alleged offender.  Remedial measures adopted under several General Assembly resolutions on the matter could  if properly implemented  address those jurisdictional gaps.  While some Member States had expressed a preference for the host State to play a predominant role  the African Group preferred to emphasize the role of the State of nationality. GEORGINA GUILLEN-GRILLO (Costa Rica)  speaking for the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  stressed that any type of misconduct especially criminal behaviour committed by United Nations personnel was unacceptable and should not go unpunished.  Not convinced that the registered number of allegations of criminal activities reflected the true extent of the problem  she requested that the Secretariat continue to improve information exchange and communication with Member States immediately after learning of any incident with criminal implications. Furthermore  she said  the process being standardized for notifying Member States of serious allegations of misconduct involving uniformed personnel should also be followed for incidents involved United Nations officials and non-uniformed experts on mission.  States with referred cases should give proper follow-up and inform the Secretary-General of actions taken.  No State had contacted the Office of Legal Affairs to note that their matter had been raised with the relevant officials.  It was the responsibility of the Secretary-General and Member States to take every measure to prevent and punish criminal activities by United Nations personnel and to enforce standards of conduct. GILLES MARHIC  representative of the European Union Delegation  highlighted his continued support for a zero tolerance policy and a coherent approach within the United Nations to establish an “age of accountability”.  While the Organization’s officials and experts enjoyed immunity when on mission  they were expected to respect the law and national legislation of the host State.  Impunity for crimes of a serious nature they might commit would negatively affect the credibility of the United Nations in the long term.  He welcomed the “rights upfront” initiative and special measures taken for protection against sexual exploitation and abuse.  Allegations must be properly investigated. While primary responsibility for bringing offenders to justice lay with the States themselves  in accordance with the Rome Statute  the International Criminal Court should exercise its jurisdiction where the preconditions for such exercise existed and national authorities were unable or unwilling to prosecute  he said. However  training and awareness-raising on the Organization’s standards of conduct remained central as preventive measures in the field and at Headquarters.  The State of the alleged perpetrator’s nationality should be informed promptly to establish proper jurisdiction.  States must fully implement their obligations under international law  he said  expressing support for combining short- and long-term measures to deal with jurisdictional gaps. NATALIE PIERCE (New Zealand)  speaking also for Canada and Australia  noted the efforts of Member States to establish jurisdictions for serious crimes committed by their officials and experts on mission.  She acknowledged the 15 cases referred by the Office of Legal Affairs this year and urged Member States to continue to cooperate with the Secretary-General in reporting on efforts to investigate and prosecute individuals for serious crimes.  Despite that progress  more work needed to be done to prevent individuals from evading accountability for their conduct.  Over the long-term  there was support  in principle  for the Secretariat’s proposal for a convention that would require Member States to exercise criminal jurisdiction over nationals who were participating in United Nations operations abroad.  Dialogue in the Sixth Committee session on the question of a legal instrument was an important step forward and demonstrated the leadership that the issue required. ANDREAS MOTZFELDT KRAVIK (Norway)  speaking also for Finland  Iceland  Sweden and Denmark  said that since the topic was included on the Committee’s agenda  62 cases had been referred to States; however  the Office of Legal Affairs had received information on follow-up in only five instances.  The low rate of feedback was cause for concern since the General Assembly had no realistic basis for assessing the extent to which States carried out investigations of serious allegations of criminal conduct.  The Secretary-General’s report should include feedback by sending States to the Office of Legal Affairs about their follow-up of all cases referred to them  and not just from the most recent 12-month period.  In addition  information on the actual steps taken by the States in question should be included.  Also  a table showing all the relevant cases  the types of alleged crimes  when the case was brought to the Member State’s attention and the date and content of any response from the Member State should also be included.  That table should be updated to incorporate the information received.  Stressing that the Nordic countries’ proposal neither sought nor encouraged an exercise of “naming and shaming”  he said it would not be necessary to identify individual cases nor States in that overview. SERGEY LEONIDCHENKO (Russian Federation) said the Organization must take all possible measures to prevent the commission of crimes by its personnel  noting further that the measures currently in place seemed adequate to the current scale of the problem.  However  allegations of misconduct should be investigated in strict accordance with international law  with primary jurisdiction belonging to the State of citizenship of the person accused.  He emphasized the importance of informing the State of the alleged perpetrator in a timely manner.  Furthermore  mechanisms for cooperation during investigations should be strengthened; it was also important to include cooperation with local authorities.  Commending the preventive work done in the field  he said it had brought real benefits. YIDNEKACHEW GEBRE-MESKEL ZEWDU (Ethiopia)  associating himself with the African Group and Non-Aligned Movement  said the matter was of great importance to his country as Ethiopia was one of the active participants in the United Nations peacekeeping operations and home to several United Nations offices.  Cooperation between States and the United Nations in investigating allegations of criminal conduct of the Organization’s officials and experts on missions was critical.  Member States should establish jurisdiction over crimes committed by their nationals while serving as United Nations officials or experts on mission abroad so that existing legal gaps could be eliminated  those crimes not be met with impunity and justice be served.  Member States should also assist in criminal investigations and extradition proceedings.  Pursuant to the national criminal code  his country’s courts had jurisdiction over an Ethiopian official or expert on mission who could not be prosecuted at the place of commission of the crime due to immunity that that person enjoyed. PIMPIDA RAVIRAT THANARAT (Thailand)  associating herself with the Non-Aligned Movement  reiterated that the rule of law applied fully to the United Nations and its personnel.  She called on all Member States to ensure criminal accountability of United Nations officials and experts on mission.  One way to bring offenders to justice and end impunity was for host States and troop-contributing States to cooperate through treaties and arrangements on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters.  States also needed to adopt a more flexible approach to the double criminality principle. The Organization’s technical advice and support had helped Thailand amend its domestic laws so as to allow for investigation and prosecution.  She also expressed support for existing pre-deployment and in-mission training programmes  which promoted compliance with the United Nations code of conduct and international law. MEITAL NIR-TAL (Israel) said that crimes committed by officials and experts on mission undermined the United Nations mandate  especially with respect to relations with the local population.  She urged Member States to take appropriate national action to ensure that such crimes were not met with impunity.  Furthermore  those States to whom cases had been referred should update the Organization on their actions.  She welcomed the three-pronged strategy of prevention  enforcement and remedial action to address all forms of misconduct  particularly those of a sexual nature.  Enhancing cooperation among States  and between States and the United Nations on the matter would serve as a positive basis for progress.  She also urged all States to develop practical ways to address accountability and strengthen the capacities of their national authorities to investigate and prosecute such crimes. LESLIE KIERNAN (United States) said it was difficult to draw conclusions  given the relatively small number of case referrals.  The United Nations should provide more comprehensive analysis next year on the outcome of those referrals in the State of the official’s nationality over the same period.  In addition  aggregated information on the nature of the crimes  requests to waive immunity and the standard for determining whether such referrals were made would be welcomed.  Member States should report to the United Nations on the disposition of cases to support and inform analysis of the actual  rather than speculative  gaps in jurisdiction and legislation.  It would also be useful for the Organization to provide a more systematic way for States to report on the outcome of such referrals in the future.  On the recommendation for a multilateral convention  he said such an instrument would not present the most efficient or effective means to ensure accountability.  The Committee could consider asking the Secretary-General to examine and report on what obstacles might have blocked effective prosecutions in the past and add the results to the long-term analysis. WAN AIMA NADZIHAN WAN SULAIMAN (Malaysia) said she fully supported cooperation between States and the United Nations through the exchange of information and expediting of investigations and prosecutions.  That would ensure there was no impunity for serious crimes committed by officials and experts on United Nations missions.  Malaysia’s Extradition Act of 1992 and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 2002 helped provide a legal basis for international cooperation.  Concerns had been raised about information and evidence-sharing mechanisms used during investigations carried out by the United Nations.  The issue merited in-depth consideration.  Regarding the draft convention prepared by the Group of Legal Experts  she said that additional study was needed to determine such a convention’s feasibility.  Those efforts should not prevent the Sixth Committee’s Working Group on the matter from identifying significant issues and exploring practical solutions  independent from the draft text of the proposal. PHAM THI THU HUONG (Viet Nam)  associating herself with the Non-Aligned Movement  noting that her country had started to participate in the Organization’s peacekeeping missions this year  said that further measures were needed to close jurisdictional gaps.  She called on all States to take the necessary steps  including adoption of legislation and enhancement of international cooperation  to ensure criminal accountability of nationals for any offence committed while on mission for the United Nations.  Viet Nam had taken measures that allowed the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction over crimes committed by nationals in other countries under certain circumstances and had concluded agreements on extradition and mutual legal assistance with many other States. KOTESWARA RAO (India)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  said offences committed by Indian officials or experts on mission while serving abroad were subject to the jurisdiction of Indian courts and punishable under Indian law  which also had provisions for assistance in criminal matters.  Dealing with the wrongdoings of United Nations officials or experts on mission did not require an international convention.  Member States must ensure that their laws provided for jurisdiction and had adequate provisions for prosecuting any such conduct of nationals who served as United Nations officials or experts on mission abroad.  Additionally  those laws should have provisions for international assistance for the investigation and prosecution of the crimes committed. MOHAMED ATLASSI (Morocco)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and African Group  said that any criminal infraction committed by a United Nations official on mission should be addressed by the State of nationality of the offender.  Further  the Organization should strengthen cooperation with Member States in that context.  He expressed support for preventive measures  including strengthening training of civilian and military personnel on proper conduct in the field and at Headquarters.  The legitimacy of the Organization’s work depended upon the confidence it enjoyed  which was harmed by infractions committed by its staff.  Such alleged perpetrators must not enjoy impunity for serious crimes  but be investigated and prosecuted  if necessary  with respect for all relevant international law. MOHAMED SALAH EDDINE BELAID (Algeria)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  expressed concern over the persistence of cases and instances of sexual exploitation and abuses.  He noted an increase in the number of cases of misconduct for the reporting period 1 January to 31 December 2013.  However  overall  during the last decade  there had been a downward trend in allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse.  He expressed hope that there would be a decrease in such crimes by the next report.  Immunity enjoyed by officials and experts on mission should not offer impunity for serious crimes they might commit.  Therefore  measures initiated by the Secretary-General that promptly brought credible allegations of such crimes to the attention of the States of nationality were welcomed  as was the implementation of preventive components.  He also expressed satisfaction at the development of an accountability framework to measure performance in the field  to be implemented in the third quarter of 2015. HUSSEIN ABDULLAHI (Nigeria) commended the zero-tolerance policy on criminal conduct  especially as it concerned sexual exploitation and abuse committed by United Nations personnel and experts on mission.  He voiced support for the current procedure that let police of a troop-contributing Member State exercise authority over an erring national on a mission.  Referral of alleged criminal conduct to the State of the official or expert for investigation and possible prosecution was also welcomed.  He urged States to report their subsequent steps to the Organization and prosecute their nationals for any offence committed while on mission and  if necessary  adapt their national legislation to guarantee jurisdiction would be exercised.  Activities by the Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and Field Support  which raised awareness of personnel in the field missions  and an initiative to develop an accountability framework were commendable.  The framework would measure field missions’ performance around several indicators relating to conduct and discipline. RUBÉN IGNACIO ZAMORA RIVAS (El Salvador)  associating himself with CELAC  said all individuals must be subject to the rule of law irrespective of their functions.  Establishing who should have competence for those serious crimes was an important step for States.  However  it would not always be necessary to change the description of the crime and expressly include officials and experts on mission since most States already considered serious crimes to be punishable by law  irrespective of who committed them.  In that regard  it would be more useful for States to ensure the applicability of criminal law in the broadest context and not be limited to the territoriality principle. CHOI YONGHOON (Republic of Korea) said that bringing United Nations personnel who committed a crime to justice was a crucial part of the continuing global fight against impunity.  If such serious violations were not prosecuted  the Organization might create the false signal that its officials and experts could improperly abuse immunities for the sole purpose of their private benefit.  The recurring misuse of immunities could bring about serious institutional damage to the credibility  impartiality and integrity of the international body.  It was important for the States of nationality to periodically inform the Office of Legal Affairs of ongoing progress  including details of their legal procedures and final results of cases within their jurisdiction.  In his country  the selected personnel for peacekeeping operations took a three-month intensive training course prior to their deployment to prevent such offenses. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-21,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaspd563.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Facing limited resources and expanding responsibilities  the Department of Public Information was striving to make the best use of its tools to fulfil its mandate and address new challenges such as coverage of the Ebola outbreak  the Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) heard today  as it began its annual consideration of questions relating to information. The Department’s efforts had largely been guided by the strong support it received from Member States  said Maher Nasser  its Acting Head.  “The job of the Department was to be the Organization’s public voice  to tell the United Nations story to as many people as possible.  In doing so  the Department set priorities in a manner that allowed it to do what was achievable  and where it could have the best results ” he said. The strategic approach had best been reflected in overall outreach efforts during the high-level period of the current General Assembly session.  The Department had deployed the full array of media tools at its disposal — both new and traditional — and further energized and expanded its pool of outreach partners.  That had helped the Department to successfully connect and engage audiences worldwide. Interest in the United Nations peaked on social media during the general debate and related high-level meetings  he said  reporting that the English-language accounts broke all previous records  with a total of more than 27 million people viewing the Department’s updates on Facebook.  One of the most popular posts ever had been a tweet about Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks to last month’s Security Council meeting on threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts or foreign terrorist fighters.  Climate content  he noted  was estimated to have been seen by half of all active Twitter users — 127 million people.  Chinese social media was particularly strong as well; United Nations posts on the Weibo platform  for example  were read more than 112 million times during the high-level week. The Department  he noted  had created a website dedicated to the United Nations system-wide Global Response to Ebola  aiming to be the hub for official and up-to-date information.  The website would showcase updates on the status of the epidemic  the newly established United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER)  the decisions of the main organs of the United Nations  its partners in the global response  current news on Ebola from the News Centre  a Twitter feed for #ebolaresponse  and a link by which users could make donations. “Instead of resting on our laurels  we remain committed to further sharpening our tools and better coordinating our activities ” Mr Nasser said.  “Inform.  Engage.  Act.  This remains our guiding principle.  We know a strong UN means a better world.  Together  we can achieve this goal.” In the interactive discussion that followed  a speaker praised the Department as the voice of the United Nations  as another urged it to do more energetic work in fostering dialogue among civilizations.  Yet another representative sought inclusion in the United Nations database of proceedings in all official United Nations languages for future reference. Responding  Mr. Nasser said the Department organized regular events and spearheaded initiatives to promote a culture that respected those values by utilizing diverse platforms.  On multilingualism  he said budgetary constraints resulted in the availability of archival material only in the floor language.  Earlier  he noted that some 150 events during the general debate week were webcast live in the six official languages  as well as in the original language of the speaker  which had yielded more than 2.5 million views.   Also addressing the Committee  Sam Kutesa  President of the General Assembly  said it was important for the Department to spread awareness of the sustainable development goals in the context of the post-2015 agenda.  The Fourth Committee had played a historically important role in promoting the purpose and principles of the Organization  he added. As the Committee began debate on the agenda item  the representative of Thailand lauded the contribution of the Department in promoting global awareness on issues such as sustainable development  the Millennium Development Goals  disarmament  and peacekeeping. The representative of Costa Rica emphasized the need for new and innovative methods that allowed for a better flow and increased precision in the distribution of information  as well as for non-discriminatory and inclusive access. Speaking on behalf of the Group of Friends of Spanish at the United Nations  the representative of Argentina said it was a matter of growing concern for the Group that new activities and products did not demonstrate the linguistic parity among the six languages that the General Assembly had enshrined as the Department’s guiding mandate. The United Nations had an important role in providing credible information  said the representative of Syria  citing the “negative role played by some biased mass media”. Also making statements were the representatives of Trinidad and Tobago  Cuba  Mexico  Brazil and Israel  along with a representative of the European Union delegation.   Chibaula David Silwamba  Rapporteur of the thirty-sixth session of the Committee on Information  introduced that body’s report. The Committee will meet at 3 p.m. Wednesday  22 October  to continue its consideration of questions relating to information. Background The Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) met this afternoon to begin its annual consideration of questions relating to information  for which it had before it documents A/69/310 and A/69/21. Opening Remarks SAM KUTESA  President of the General Assembly  said the Department of Public Information had been instrumental in implementing the United Nations communication and information strategy.  It was important to spread awareness of the sustainable development goals in the context of the post-2015 agenda.  The Fourth Committee had played a historically important role in promoting the purpose and principles of the Organization. The world was in the midst of the third international decade for the eradication of colonialism  he said  adding that much work remained to be done.  At the same time  decolonization was one of the Organization’s successes.  When the United Nations was founded  almost two-thirds of the world’s territories were under colonialism  while today  a remaining 16 Non-Self-Governing Territories were home to just 2 million people.  Several speakers in the General Assembly stressed the urgency of a two-State solution in the Middle East  but  regrettably  peace remained uncertain.  The United Nations should continue to support the parties in achieving a just  lasting  and comprehensive peace. Peacekeeping and peacebuilding  he said  remained mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution.  The contexts had become complex and challenging  often placing personnel and assets of the United Nations in increasing danger.  The world must stand united in condemning those who attacked peacekeepers. Regional organizations continued to play an important role in the maintenance of peace and security  he said  adding that the United Nations  together with those organizations  had important compatibilities that could be deployed in conflict management.  Those links had expanded in recent years  he said  adding that the efforts of both the African Union and United Nations had borne fruit in Somalia.  Kosovo and Haiti were other examples of successful partnerships.  Regional groups had comparative advantages and regional proximity  which should be promoted. Space-based technology and tools played a valuable role in achieving sustainable development  he said  stressing the importance of sustainable use of outer space. Presentation of Report CHIBAULA DAVID SILWAMBA (Zambia)  Rapporteur of the Committee on Information  presented the report of that body’s thirty-sixth session  during which  he said  several speakers had emphasized the central role of the United Nations in global affairs  and of the Department of Public Information as its public voice.  Speakers had acknowledged that the United Nations was the only universal forum for collective deliberation and decision-making on the international community’s concerns. Much of the discussion during the session  he recalled  had focused on the role of multilingualism and the use of new communication platforms.  Appreciation was expressed for the growing use of the new information and communication technologies.  However  one speaker  representing a large group  had voiced concern about the deepening disparity in the use of official United Nations languages on the Organization’s website  despite the Department’s efforts to improve multilingual content. Another speaker  also reflecting the views of a large group  expressed the members’ satisfaction with the Committee’s explicit support of the mainstreaming of multilingualism in the Secretariat’s communication and information activities.  She commended the Department for its partnership arrangements on increasing the availability of multilingual content in a cost-neutral manner; also  for its continued efforts to enhance the United Nations website’s accessibility. Referring to the General Assembly’s request for the issuance of United Nations press releases in all six official languages  a speaker  also reflecting the views of a large group  reiterated the call for the Department to design and implement a strategy in close collaboration with other departments through creative schemes  in a cost-neutral manner.  The speaker emphasized that the use of the phrase “creative schemes” in the current resolution was deliberate  as the group recognized that in times of zero-real increases in budgets  departments must find ways of doing more with static resources. Another speaker  voicing the concern of her group about the strategy on press releases submitted by the Department  noted that fewer meetings would be covered if that were enacted.  The group was particularly concerned that several important United Nations bodies would not receive any coverage under the proposed plan  in any language.  Since summary records were not available for some of those bodies  press releases were the only way to ensure transparency  accountability  and institutional memory. Another speaker  sharing his group’s concern about inconsistency on the Department’s website with regard to the principle of parity among the six official languages  reiterated that the Department’s existing mandate demanded that it deliver press releases in all official languages. Several speakers voiced strong support for the network of United Nations Information Centres  describing them as a vital source of information for local communities  he said.  A number of speakers identified individual Information Centres located in their respective capitals  and lauded their efforts to promote the work of the United Nations  often using local languages and in partnership with local authorities. Several speakers welcomed the growing importance of the United Nations Academic Impact as a global platform for universities and research organizations.  Still others applauded the Department for its special information programme on the question of Palestine  including the training programme for Palestinian journalists.  In response to the common consensus for augmenting multilingualism in the Department’s work  the Committee Chairperson had proposed that a Group of Friends work with the Department on effective  pragmatic  and creative ways through which to address the issue of multilingualism. Statement by Acting Head  Department of Public Information MAHER NASSER  Acting Head of the Department of Public Information  said the Department’s efforts had largely been guided by the strong support it had received from Member States.  The job of the Department was to be the Organization’s public voice  to tell the United Nations story to as many people as possible. In doing so  the Department set priorities in a manner that allowed it to do what was achievable  and where it could have the best results.  The strategic approach had best been reflected in overall outreach efforts during the high-level period of the current General Assembly session.  The Department had deployed the full array of media tools at its disposal — both new and traditional — and further energized and expanded its pool of outreach partners.  That had helped the Department to successfully connect and engage audiences worldwide. The Department  he said  had played a critical role in the success of the Secretary-General’s Climate Summit on 23 September  through large-scale outreach to media  civil society  and other stakeholders.  It had developed key messages  created communications products  provided content for the Summit website  and led a United Nations-wide social media strategy.  The Department also had organized press conferences  drafted press releases  and managed a digital media zone on the day of the event to increase social media engagement.  It also had led communication efforts for other key events during the high-level period  he said  adding that external partnerships would be further strengthened during the year. Interest in the work of the United Nations during the general debate and related high-level meetings was especially strong on social media  he said.  The English-language accounts broke all previous records  with a total of more than 27 million people viewing the Department’s updates on Facebook.  One of the most popular posts ever had been a tweet about Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks to last month’s Security Council meeting on threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts or foreign terrorist fighters.  Climate content was estimated to have been seen by half of all active Twitter users — 127 million people.  Chinese social media was particularly strong as well; United Nations posts on the Weibo platform  for example  were read more than 112 million times during the high-level week. As part of the Department’s efforts to make better strategic use of its United Nations Information Centres  a group of information centres participated  for the first time — via a web-based video conferencing tool — in a live briefing on the Climate Summit.  That new approach helped to ensure that journalists who were not able to attend the Summit in person could still cover the event with informed knowledge.  The Department had organized similar briefing sessions with 26 Information Centres on the General Assembly’s main agenda items  as well as a briefing on the United Nations World Conference on Indigenous Peoples. He said that Member States were partners in the Department’s efforts to better explain the work of United Nations peacekeeping and political missions to the public worldwide.  The Department was increasingly providing staff on short-term assignments to missions during their critical start-up phases  such as in Mali and the Central African Republic. Using the Information Centres  the Department was both promoting the efforts of troop-contributing countries through outreach campaigns  and building the troops’ communications skills before they were deployed. The Department’s calibrated approach to public information included ensuring a balance between new and traditional means of communication  he said.  From United Nations Radio and Television to the United Nations News Centre and Photo Unit  the Organization’s traditional news platforms posted record levels of engagement  from downloads to posts to page views.  The live webcasting — in the six official languages  as well as the original language of the speaker — of some 150 events during the general debate week had yielded more than 2.5 million views.  Videos posted on YouTube  Youku  Tudou and Tencent were viewed more than 3.17 million times  and the demand for broadcast-quality videos increased by 103 per cent — compared to last year’s high-level period.  Some 2 500 journalists from around the world were accredited and assisted by the Department in their coverage of various meetings at Headquarters  500 more than for the same period last year. This year  he continued  the Department created a dedicated online portal that gave access to the video  audio  text  and summary of the statements of Member States as they became available.  The Department also developed a customized website for the President of the sixty-ninth session  and launched two new “apps” for mobile devices  in time for the opening of the new session.  Those  along with UN Audio Channels and UN News Reader  made it possible for people to listen to live audio from United Nations meetings and radio content in different languages  as well as to read the latest news from the News Centre on their smart phones. The Department also had created a website dedicated to the United Nations system-wide Global Response to Ebola  aiming to be the hub for official and up-to-date information  he said.  He added that the website would showcase updates on the status of the epidemic  the newly established United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER)  the decisions of the main organs of the United Nations  its partners in the global response  current news on Ebola from the News Centre  a Twitter feed for #ebolaresponse  and a link by which users can make donations.  The Department had loaned two staff members to the United Nations Ebola Crisis Centre to coordinate strategic communications for United Nations agencies  funds and programmes  and other partners.  The two staff members were subsequently deployed to Accra  as part of UNMEER. A team representing the full spectrum of the Department’s areas of work had been created to provide advice and to support the Organization’s communications efforts.  The Department was chairing an inter-agency Ebola Communications Group  which was established to structure and share UN-wide messaging  updates  and contacts.  It also had mobilized the Information Centres in sub-Saharan Africa  asking them to regularly update Headquarters on measures by United Nations Country Teams and Governments to mitigate the further spread of the deadly disease. Another way in which the Department continued to make improvements to serve the needs of Member States and others was the Dag Hammarskjöld Library  he said  adding  “We all struggle with information overload and information inequality. The Library — or DHL  as we call it — is your ally in that struggle.  Listening to what delegates want and need  the Library has expanded and customized services for you.”  Research facilities included up-to-the-minute political analysis  media sources and e-books — all online and free for delegations’ use.  The new “DAG Discovery” provided a single point of online access.  “Ask DAG”  launched this year  was a multilingual online service with frequently-asked questions on United Nations topics that channelled requests from researchers worldwide.  Research guides were in all six languages. Noting that the United Nations Intranet  iSeek  was now accessible outside United Nations networks from mobile devices and home computers  he said that allowed staff members to work more efficiently  and would foster a greater sense of community within the United Nations family.  The Department remained committed to expanding its outreach with the academic community.  The United Nations Academic Impact initiative remained the gateway for schools of higher learning and research to connect with the United Nations and with each other for promoting key priorities on the Organization’s agenda.  United Nations Academic Impact members  responding to the call by the Secretary-General to use the global celebration of the Organization’s seventieth anniversary to honour the historic breadth of its development  security  and human rights work  were planning a wide range of activities  including designating a “UN70” scholarship for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. He said that the Department continued to harness its outreach with civil society and members of the creative community.  In late August  a record 2 200 participants from some 700 non-governmental organizations  representing nearly 100 countries  had participated here at Headquarters in the sixty-fifth annual DPI-NGO Conference  which allowed the voice of an important civil society forum to be heard in the debate around the post-2015 development agenda.  In keeping with the Assembly’s mandate to promote multilingualism throughout the United Nations  the Department launched  in September  a new Arabic-language version of Basic Facts — the first such edition since 1980.  Funded by the United Arab Emirates  the Arabic edition would be distributed as a non-sales item to United Nations Information Centres and other outlets throughout the world  including schools. In the draft resolution on questions relating to information  Member States had encouraged the Department “to make the UN Chronicle available in paperless editions only  with a view to expanding the service to all six official languages within existing resources”.  Based on current costs  translation in five official languages of the magazine in 2016-2017 would total $260 000.  That was in contrast to total printing costs in English and French for that period  amounting to $32 000.  Viewed from another angle  stopping printing of the magazine for the entire biennium would cover only the publication of about a single issue in all official languages  out of a total of eight issues over the two-year period.  While the Department would still meet the needs of paid subscribers  the Information Centres in many countries  developing and developed alike  still relied on having a base of flagship print publications for outreach and information purposes.  The Department’s efforts to live up to its commitments to the global audience would continue to be guided by Member States’ recommendations and budgetary decisions. Success was often described as doing the best one could with what one had  he said  and faced with limited resources and expanding mandates  the Department had made every effort to make the best use of its resources — the most important of which was its staff.  Instead of resting on its laurels  the Department remained committed to further sharpening its tools and better coordinating its activities. Inform. Engage. Act.  That remained its guiding principle.  A strong United Nations meant a better world.  Together  that goal could be achieved  he concluded. Interactive Dialogue When the floor was opened for discussion  the representative of Iran stressed the importance of more energetic work by the Department of Public Information in fostering dialogue among civilizations and peace  especially in the context of growing violence and extremism.  He urged the Department to expand the duration and reach of its training programme for journalists.  The representative of Argentina said it was heartening to see simultaneous interpretations of speeches and other improvements in the dissemination of information in the General Assembly.  Those interpretations should be kept in the database in all languages for future reference; currently  information was kept there in English  even if it was originally delivered in Spanish. The representative of Lebanon said the Department of Public Information was becoming the voice of the United Nations  which  indeed  brought new challenges.  She asked what steps the Department would take to strengthen partnerships in the future.  She also sought more information on the activities of the United Nations Information Centres  and ways of ensuring the widespread dissemination of the UN Chronicle. The representative of Guatemala said the statistics in the report of the Secretary-General were scarce  paltry  and not related to what had been requested.  He asked why more detailed statistics on the use of various languages were not given.  He also asked about the status of press releases in other languages  and wondered whether combining audio and video files together would be more effective. The representative of Iraq said there was unanimity in supporting his country’s efforts against terrorism  and asked whether the Department could more effectively portray the risks and challenges posed by that scourge. Responding to the questions and comments  Mr. NASSER said working for peace and tolerance was part of the reason the United Nations was founded.  Therefore  the Department of Public Information organized regular events and initiatives to promote a culture that respected those values by utilizing diverse platforms. The number of participants in the training programme for journalists had actually grown this year  compared to last  he said.  Given its limited funding  however  the Department had only been able to increase that number by shortening the duration of the programme.  Efforts would be made to improve the programme on both levels. On multilingualism  he said archival material was only available in the floor language because of budgetary constraints.  Similarly  Information Centres were using new technologies in an environment of limited resources  and the Department was doing its best to distribute the UN Chronicle within those resource constraints. Partnerships between the United Nations and academia and civil society were aimed at promoting the impact of the Organization’s work in an efficient manner  he said.  For that purpose  as well  the Department tried to identify celebrities with track records on relevant issues.  National celebrities were often named as Goodwill Ambassadors because they were more identifiable locally.  “We try to be strategic and not overstay our welcome ” he added. In terms of audio files  only two languages were archived  again because of lack of resources.  He said the Department would look into ways of improving the situation.  As for press releases in other languages  the Department was awaiting engagement with the group established for that purpose. On Iraq  Mr. MAHER said that the Department disseminated information emanating from the United Nations mission there  and its coverage had highlighted the risks and challenges posed by terrorism.  Information was needed from United Nations agencies on the ground  so that more information on the overall challenge of rebuilding Iraq could be put out. NORACHIT SINHASENI (Thailand)  speaking on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  said he valued the contribution of the Department of Public Information in promoting global awareness of the work of the United Nations on issues such as sustainable development  the Millennium Development Goals  disarmament  and peacekeeping.  The Committee should focus more attention to the issue of multilingualism  he added.  Commending the United Nations Academic Impact initiative  he said that ASEAN also supported efforts made by the Department to utilize social media platforms to complement the use of traditional media.  He encouraged the Department to pay careful attention to accurate reporting of events. ASEAN  he said  called upon countries with advanced technology to provide assistance to developing countries and help bridge the digital divide.  He noted that the region attached great importance to raising awareness through information and communications technologies (ICT).  In his national capacity  he added that Thailand’s technology policy aimed to empower both the Thai government and the private sector to benefit from ICT.  He welcomed the Department’s collaboration with other United Nations departments  such as Peacekeeping Operations and Political Affairs  and commended its support to peacekeeping missions in Haiti  Liberia  and Côte d’Ivoire.  He finally underlined the importance of accurate and credible information to today‘s changing world.  JUAN CARLOS MENDOZA-GARCÍA (Costa Rica)  speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  said information should always contribute to the welfare of human beings and the promotion of sustainable development through the integration of its three pillars: economic  social  and environmental.  The changing global situation with regard to information  required that the international community adopt new  innovative methods that allowed for a better flow and increased precision in the distribution of information  as well as for non-discriminatory and inclusive access.  Electronic communication had a high potential to generate exchanges in multiple ways.  However  although it was a useful tool  there was a growing digital gap between developed and developing countries  which had negative consequences.  It was  therefore  important to continue using traditional methods to transmit the messages of the Organization — namely through radio  television  and written press  as those constituted the major sources of information in developing countries. He said that freedom of speech and press were indispensable values and principles of democracy; they should be exercised responsibly  in line with the relevant national legislative frameworks and instruments.  Further  multilingualism was associated with the very existence of the United Nations  which was why it was essential that information be disseminated in as many languages as possible — including Portuguese and indigenous languages.  There should be parity and respect for all official languages of the Organization  he said  stressing that there could be no effective action by the United Nations without proper dissemination of its work. EDEN CHARLES (Trinidad and Tobago)  on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  commended the Department of Public Information on its efforts to inform the widest audience possible about the Millennium Development Goals  disarmament  and climate change  through utilizing multiple languages  among other means.  Outreach for the shaping of the post-2015 development agenda remained essential to ensuring that all were kept updated and engaged in the process.  CARICOM welcomed the webcasting of the General Assembly formal meetings and the Security Council; the use of social media in all six official languages and efforts to increase multilingualism; and the work to increase outreach to youth.  Partnerships remained important in reducing disparities in the flow of information for developing countries still relying mainly on traditional media. He reaffirmed the support of CARICOM to the United Nations Information Centres.  However  he remained concerned over the fact that the regional Centre for the Caribbean was still without a director.  In addition  he expressed appreciation for activities marking the International Day of Remembrance of Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade.  Regarding the issue of non-communicable diseases  he underscored the importance of ensuring that information continued to be made available on prevention and control.  Finally  he applauded improvements made in information dissemination and the use of official and other languages. MATEO ESTREME (Argentina)  speaking on behalf of the Group of Friends of Spanish at the United Nations  said that the growing interest of the Spanish-speaking public in the work of the Organization was instrumental in the formation of the Group last year.  Cooperation between the United Nations and the Group would redound to the benefit of dissemination of information.  He invited all Member States to become observers in the Group to demonstrate the importance of multilingualism.  Expressing appreciation for the work of the Department of Public Information  he lauded  in particular  personnel of the Spanish television and radio units  the library  and the Information Centres  for their contribution to fostering peace  solidarity  and cooperation among peoples. Traffic on the United Nations website had been increasing across all languages.  However  it was a matter of growing concern for the Group that new activities and products did not demonstrate the linguistic parity among the six languages that the General Assembly had enshrined as the Department’s guiding mandate.  Spanish  according to latest available statistics  was the second-most requested language  but there was no disaggregated data portraying a clearer picture.  Multilingualism was inherent in the work of the United Nations  and cut across platforms and activities.  In that light  the Department should come up with “creative means” to fulfil the General Assembly’s mandate to produce the daily press releases in Spanish and the five other official languages.  The principle of justice in the midst of scarcity should be pursued  so that any one language was not favoured over others. IOANNIS VRAILAS  representative of the European Union Delegation  commended the efforts of the Department of Public Information in communicating the work of the United Nations to the widest possible audience.  He welcomed the efforts by the Secretary-General to integrate strategic communications  news  and outreach services.  A strategic framework across the United Nations system was important  in view of the challenges the Department faced in building coherence and consistency in the shaping and implementation of the post-2015 agenda.  He welcomed the efforts to use all media tools  as well as to integrate the work of the Information Centres.  Close collaboration across the Organization through the United Nations Communications Group  was key for the Time for Global Action Campaign. Currently  he said  the international community faced numerous challenges such as extremism  the situation in Iraq and Syria  the Ebola virus and climate change  to name just a few.  It was important to inform the public about such challenges through the use of multiple languages on social media platforms.  Multilingualism in the Organization’s information was a key issue for the European Union.  Information Centres were of great value to ensure that all were engaged in the final push to shape the next round of development goals.  Human rights issues should also be given prominent focus through ongoing attention throughout the year  and not just through special campaigns. DAVID FORÉS RODRIGUEZ (Cuba)  endorsing the statements made on behalf of CELAC and the Group of Friends of Spanish  said the reports presented to the Committee were testimony to the effective use of new technologies in the dissemination of the work of the United Nations.  There was a growing gap  however  in information and communication technology.  In that light  he urged the Department of Public Information to continue using traditional media.  The importance of radio in tackling Ebola was highlighted recently.  The Department should hold consultations on how best to utilize new media.  He stressed the importance of multilingualism in the Organization’s work  and called for strategies to ensure the publication of press releases in all six official languages.  Cuba  he maintained  faced invasion of its communications airwaves by the United States  in violation of the regulations of the UN Charter.  Social media was being used for subversion as well; such use of new technologies was contrary to principles of peaceful relations and cooperation.  Cuba was ready to work with the international community to build a new world order of communication based on equity and justice. RICARDO ALDAY GONZÁLEZ (Mexico) said that  for most countries  traditional media continued to be the only source of information on developments around the world.  Voicing concern over the digital divide  he urged collaboration among various sectors to bridge it.  Equitable access to information media was a necessity for prosperity  he said  stressing the need to make information products available in Spanish.  Mexico was ready to work with others to identify ways of achieving that objective effectively.  He called for the Department to create new tools to highlight the  work of the United Nations in the Millennium Development Goals  and conflict prevention and resolution.  Lessons learned could provide lasting benefits in those areas.  The pursuit of comprehensive  balanced  and objective information products must be backed by editorial independence and accuracy  he stressed. THIAGO TAVARES VIDAL (Brazil)  associating with CARICOM  said the world had experienced a revolution in how it communicated and obtained information.  Those information and communications technologies had changed the way people perceived the world  interacted with others  and treated the process of information.  The Department of Public Information had proved capable of using those new technologies  and had a significant presence on social media.  Nonetheless  the international community must not lose sight of the fact that the vast majority of people — more than 4.3 billion people — still lacked access to the Internet.  In Africa  only 19 per cent of the population had online access.  Therefore  traditional means of communication should not fail to receive attention and resources from the Department. The network of United Nations Information Centres  she said  had a vital role in disseminating the messages of the Organization to local populations.  That had proved essential in mobilizing support for the work of the United Nations.  Last year  the Centre in Rio became the major source of information about the Organization in Portuguese.  The Department should further develop and improve initiates that supported multilingualism  and guaranteed the diffusion of the principles and work of the United Nations. IHAB HAMED (Syria) said that the Department had a key role in explaining the objective of the United Nations in different parts of the world.  It presented the coverage of events throughout the world  and it made and led public opinion.  Because of the negative role played by some biased mass media  changing facts  advocating terrorism  and promoting the culture of violence  he stressed the importance of the United Nations in providing credible information  free from politicization and distortion.  He saluted journalists who put themselves in harm’s way to cover despicable acts. He disagreed with some high-ranking officials who described some terrorist organizations as armed opposition groups in Syria.  His delegation stressed the importance of the Department’s actions on the question of Palestine  in light of the increasing suffering of the Palestinian people brought about by the Israel occupation and violation of international laws.  He urged the Department to continue its international programme on Palestine.  It must also focus its efforts in expediting parity among the official languages of the United Nations.  Intercultural and interfaith dialogue was necessary for freedom of expression  but that could not be used to attack the beliefs of others.  He called on all Member States to cooperate with the Department  as issues such as decolonization  combatting terrorism  or the right of people to sustainable development  were important. YAEL BITTON (Israel) said that the Holocaust and the United Nations Outreach Programme would mark its tenth anniversary this year.  Over the last decade  the international community had brought life to resolution 60/7  which served as a model for educational programmes at the United Nations.  The outreach programme produced educational material in all United Nations official languages  and was delivered worldwide through the Organization’s Information Centres.  Israel applauded the Holocaust programme for its commitment to initiate a wide range of activities at Headquarters.  Israel had partnered with the Department of Public Information and had continued to contribute to the thematic functions that sought to inform  educate  and inspire.  Israel welcomed the Department’s open-minded approach  embracing new communication tools and technologies to reach new and young global audiences. Regarding the Department’s Special Information Programme on the Question of Palestine  she said her country remained concerned that the programme generated a narrative that was biased and misleading.  Based on that one-sided mandate  the Israeli Government would continue to not participate in the programme.  She reiterated that Israel was willing to engage in the formulation of a more constructive and balanced resolution to mandate further activities. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-21,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gashc4107.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Forensic science played a key role regarding the obligation of States to investigate and prosecute allegations of torture or other ill-treatment  a special rapporteur said today  as the Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) began its discussion on human rights. “Effective medical and forensic documentation can bring evidence of torture and other ill-treatment to light so that perpetrators may be held accountable ” said Juan Méndez  Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  Indeed  the lack of investigation and of accountability perpetuated the practice of torture and other ill-treatment.  The Special Rapporteur’s fact-finding mission had discovered that States were reluctant to carry out criminal investigations into torture allegations and accurate statistics on its incidence were difficult to obtain. However  scientific evidence obtained by an effective investigation  including impartial  independent and thorough forensic evaluations  assisted States to comply with their obligations systematically and to investigate  prosecute and punish each incident of torture.  Instrumental in overcoming a lack of objective evidence were medical records  which played a major role in preventing future acts of torture  he said.  In addition  adequate  extensive forensic evaluation and the effective training of health  legal and other professionals involved in documenting and investigating cases of reported torture and other ill-treatment could positively impact the detection and prevention of its practice. The Committee also heard briefings from other four United Nations experts: Claudio Grossman  Chair of the Committee against Torture; Malcolm Evans  Chair of the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture; Maria-Virginia Bras Gomes  Rapporteur of the Committee on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  reading a statement on behalf of its Chair  Zdzislaw Kedzia; and Nigel Rodley  Chair of the Committee on Human Rights. Mr. Grossman said the Committee against Torture had registered 627 complaints presented by individuals alleging violations by a State party.  Individuals from only 66 of the 156 States parties had had that possibility  he said  because 90 States parties had not yet declared their recognition of the Committee’s competence  thereby limiting available tools to supervise the full compliance with the Convention. Mr. Evans said the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture was not a source of abstract legal obligations  but a set of practical tools in the form of independent national preventive mechanisms.  He also underlined the need to be open and honest about the reality of governance within places of detention  reminding delegates that “it is the Subcommittee’s role to understand and advise rather than to investigate  expose or condemn”. Ms. Gomes said the General Assembly had referred to direct assistance to States parties at the national level by building and developing institutional capacity for reporting and strengthening technical knowledge through ad hoc training.  Turning to the post-2015 agenda she said it must be linked with human rights  particularly economic  social and cultural rights.  The new development goals  as well as its indicators and benchmarks  needed to be explicitly aligned with human rights principles and standards  she added. Mr. Rodley said failure to promote and protect all human rights contributed to the root causes of escalating violence in certain regions of the world.  In that regard  the Committee on Human Rights had assisted States parties in meeting their obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Stressing that a lack of implementation undermined the Committee’s credibility  he encouraged all States parties to give great weight to the Committee’s advice and follow-through on its recommendations. Ivan Šimonović  Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights  introduced four reports of the Secretary-General related to the implementation of human rights instruments.  He also provided an overview of how United Nations voluntary funds reached victims of torture and contemporary forms of slavery. Also delivering statements on human rights were representatives of Italy  India  Lao People’s Democratic Republic  Japan  Nicaragua  Iran  China  Kazakhstan  New Zealand  Yemen  Burkina Faso  Rwanda  Mongolia  Indonesia  Venezuela  Armenia  as well as the European Union delegation. A representative of the International Labour Organization also delivered a statement. The Third Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Wednesday  22 October  to continue its discussion on human rights. Background The Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) met this morning to begin its discussion on the promotion and protection of human rights. For its discussion on human rights instruments  the Committee had before it reports of the following: Human Rights Committee (documents A/69/40 (Vol. I)  A/69/40 (Vol. II  Part One)  A/69/40 (Vol. II  Part Two)); Committee against Torture (document A/69/44); and Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (document A/69/48).  Also before it were reports of the Secretary-General on: the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery (document A/69/290); United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture (document A/69/296); Status of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto (document A/69/284); and the Special Fund established by the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (document A/69/289). Also before members were notes by the Secretary-General transmitting the report of the Chairs of the human rights treaty bodies (document A/69/285) and the interim report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (document A/69/387). The report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (document A/69/36) was also before the Committee. Interactive Debate IVAN ŠIMONOVIĆ  Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights  introduced four reports of the Secretary-General on the implementation of human rights instruments  providing an overview of recent activities.  On the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Voluntary Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery  he said that despite the limited contribution of $409 000 received from donors  the Fund was able to support 35 organizations in all five regions of the world.  They provided rehabilitation to victims of trafficking  forced and early marriage  the worst forms of child labour  domestic servitude  bonded and forced labour  sexual exploitation and traditional slavery. Turning to the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture  he said it supported the rehabilitation of victims of torture worldwide thanks to the disbursement of some 270 grants to non-governmental channels of assistance.  Through competitiveness and clearer parameters for time-bound support to projects  he added  the Fund’s portfolio would be better balanced geographically and better able to respond to new and emergency situations. On the Secretary-General’s note transmitting the report of the Chairs of the human rights treaty bodies  he said that the main items of the agenda included a simplified reporting procedure  constructive dialogue and concluding observations.  Turning to another report of the Secretary-General  he said the Special Fund established by the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture was supporting projects in countries the Subcommittee had visited  and publishing visit reports.  It had supported 22 projects since it became operational since 2012  for a total sum of just over $600 000  he added. CLAUDIO GROSSMAN  Chair of the Committee against Torture  said that  out of 193 Member States  156 had ratified or acceded to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to date.  However  26 had never submitted a report to the Committee  violating their obligations and preventing the body from fulfilling its monitoring mandate.  Regarding individual communications  the Committee had registered 627 complaints presented by individuals alleging violations by a State party.  Individuals from only 66 of the 156 States parties had that possibility  he said  because 90 States parties had not yet declared their recognition of the Committee’s competence  thereby limiting available tools to supervise the full compliance with the Convention.  He called on States that had not yet ratified the Convention to do so  and for others to accept all procedures of the Convention in order to enable the Committee to fulfil its mandate. Recalling the Convention against Torture Initiative  a 10-year initiative launched in 2014 for the universal ratification and implementation of the Convention  he said topics to be highlighted included the sharing of implementation experiences and best practices  and identification of quantitative measures to assess compliance.  The Committee against Torture had been actively engaged in the treaty body strengthening process  including the organization of a dialogue process with treaty body chairs  States and civil society organizations. Providing information on accomplishments and challenges  he emphasized that the Committee had received continuous reports of intimidation and reprisals against individuals and groups.  It had  in that regard  designated two rapporteurs to address reprisals  and created a dedicated web page  publicly stating its concerns.  The Committee also sought to improve its working methods to face challenges that arose regarding the implementation of the Convention against Torture.  Concluding  he commended States on the thirtieth anniversary of the Convention  and called upon all stakeholders to commit themselves to the full implementation of all of the Convention’s obligations. In the ensuing interactive dialogue  representatives of Switzerland  United Kingdom  Chile and the European Union asked about measures taken to address the problem of reprisals on individuals or groups who engaged with treaty bodies and on a pilot project to create a platform assessing the work of those bodies.  Other questions related to practical opportunities to advocate for the universal ratification of the Convention and to follow-up activities. Mr. GROSSMAN said all actions of the Committee had to be guided by the principles of legality  independence and autonomy  as well as interpreted as serving humanity and looking primarily at the victims.  On initiatives to improve the work of treaty bodies  he said the Committee did not have a meeting on that issue  but all coordination initiatives were welcomed.  Reprisals needed to be dealt with  he said  announcing that a special sitting of the Committee would be organized if the question of reprisals arose.  Additional work also needed to be done on prevention  he said  welcoming suggestions from Member States. On practical measures to encourage universal ratification  he noted that there were no countries that were allowing confessions under torture or accepting the utilization of torture for any means.  Therefore  he noted  an international legal framework to deal with torture was already in place.  However  he said  it was important to promote constructive dialogues and to have meetings on capacity-building and other initiatives.  On follow-up activities  he said it was important to insist that Member States met their obligations.  Civil society  he added  also had an important role to play  as it had the capacity to mobilize volunteers as well as provide extensive experience and enthusiasm. MALCOLM EVANS  Chair of the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  presented that body’s seventh annual report  providing an update on its activities.  Pressure on the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture to undertake more field visits had increased as the number of States parties to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture rose.  Due to a lack of capacity  the Subcommittee had scheduled six visits in 2013  with that number increasing to eight in 2014  including Nicaragua  Ecuador  Malta and Azerbaijan. The Optional Protocol was not just a source of abstract legal obligations  he continued  highlighting its establishment of a set of practical tools in the form of independent national preventive mechanisms.  Those tools had proven to be of real worth  he said  noting that the Subcommittee would continue to focus on ensuring that national preventive mechanisms were established and operated as the drafters of the Optional Protocol intended.  However  despite very clear convention commitments  the Subcommittee had experienced increasing delays in receiving the required information and facilities to undertake visits efficiently. Turning to the idea of cooperation in the interests of prevention  he said that increasing attention was being paid to responses to its reports and recommendations as more visits had taken place.  Delighted by a strong trend in favour of publishing its reports  he expected to see a similar trend towards the implementation of its recommendations.  In that regard  the Subcommittee sought to expand the number of short follow-up visits.  Concluding  he underlined the need to be open and honest about the reality of governance within places of detention  reminding delegates that it was the Subcommittee’s role to understand and advise rather than to investigate  expose or condemn. Delegates then asked about a range of issues  including cooperation with regional organizations  trends and developments on national preventive mechanisms  identification and prevention of reprisals and the implementation of recommendations. Mr. Evans said that there had been an increase in the ratification of the Convention  which currently had 74 States parties.  On regional cooperation  he said the Convention required working with all organizations including local  regional  and international.  As the number of States parties to the Optional Protocol rose  the Subcommittee was expected to undertake field visits within a short period of time and to properly fulfil the Convention’s mandate.  In that regard  it was important to keep an open dialogue with the Subcommittee and States.  Due to technical and practical reasons  increasing the number of visits was hard to achieve.  However  the Subcommittee was always excited to address questions and requests coming from States parties  he said. Every country had its own national preventive mechanisms  he said.  Stressing the importance of sharing experiences and best practises  the Subcommittee was always pleased to read country reports on such mechanisms.  On reprisals  he said the measures had already been tested and the risk analysis had been completed  with outcomes to be published at the end of next calendar year.  He noted that reprisals came from many places  including from those managing detention facilities and sometimes from detainees themselves.  In that regard  the presence of national preventive mechanisms was an invaluable safeguard.  Concluding  he underlined that there must be new and innovative ways to implement the recommendations while the process was going on. JUAN MÉNDEZ  Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment  said his report reflected on the key role that forensic science played regarding the obligation of States to investigate and prosecute allegations of torture or other ill-treatment  especially with regard to individual responsibility and the fight against impunity.  “Effective medical and forensic documentation can bring evidence of torture and other ill-treatment to light so that perpetrators may be held accountable ” he said.  Medical records could be instrumental in overcoming a lack of objective evidence with which survivors of torture were confronted  given that torture mostly took place without witnesses. During fact-finding missions  he had observed that States were reluctant to carry out criminal investigations into torture allegations and that accurate statistics on the incidence of torture were difficult to obtain.  The lack of investigation  together with a lack of accountability  perpetuated the practice of torture and other ill-treatment.  Scientific evidence obtained by an effective investigation  including impartial  independent and thorough forensic evaluations  assisted States to comply with their obligations systematically to investigate  prosecute and punish each incident of torture.  Such evidence also played a major role in preventing future acts of torture by fighting impunity and holding perpetrators accountable. International law prohibited torture and ill-treatment  he said  and the three pillars in the fight against torture were the obligations of States to ensure justice and to prevent and to redress all acts of torture.  The obligation to investigate was central to the realization of all three pillars  he added.  States were obliged to undertake an effective investigation whenever there were indications of torture or other ill-treatment  he said.  Adequate  extensive forensic evaluation and the effective training of health  legal and other professionals involved in documenting and investigating cases of reported torture and other ill-treatment  he noted  could positively impact the detection and prevention of its practice. During a lively interactive segment  issues were raised by delegates from the United States  Switzerland  Bahrain  Brazil  Denmark  Norway  Argentina  Maldives  Morocco  Liechtenstein  United Kingdom  Mexico and the European Union.  Questions related to ways to make the best resources available to victims of torture  as well as to best practices of successful training for legal and medical professionals.  Other speakers asked about how to step up mechanisms to improve the use of forensic evidence in countries and about country visits. Mr. Méndez encouraged potential for exchanges for medical associations from around the world on techniques to identify torture  calling for shared best practices and technical cooperation.  Making medical examinations available at critical moments of detention was crucial to prevent torture and should be integrated into procedural codes.  On the impact of cancellations and postponements of his visits  he said his mandate relied on the cooperation of States and that last-minute cancellations had a negative impact on the organization of his work.  He also insisted on being able to visit certain countries and on the conditions he could accept  in order to conduct free and independent investigations.   On reprisals  he said there was anecdotal evidence of them  and called for devices and systems to track them.  It was also important to maintain the level of attention his visits brought to engage civil society  medical professionals and the State.  On best practices on forensic sciences  he applauded Mexico as the only country where the Istanbul Protocol [a manual on the effective investigation and documentation of torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment] was very well known and implemented  urging the sharing of best practices. Responding to a question on the responsibility of the executive branch of government  he said the exclusionary rule was mostly incumbent on the legislative branch but if the executive was involved in an investigation  they could also be informed of it.  He also mentioned the dialogue with the Deputy Secretary-General concerning the Human Rights up Front initiative  saying he looked forward to including a human rights approach in peacekeeping and in humanitarian operations. EVA CHARLOTTA SCHLYTER  of the European Union delegation  said that human rights treaty bodies were fundamental in the translation of universal norms into practical measures.  Welcoming the adoption of resolution 68/268 on strengthening those bodies  she added that technical assistance and institution-building was also vital to fostering the effective implementation of human rights obligations.  The European Union appreciated the work of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and welcomed the attention paid to the situation of human rights defenders. The Vienna Declaration on human rights  she added  remained a key reference document for the advancement of human rights worldwide.  Sadly  many countries  civil society representatives and organizations continued to experience increasing restrictions on their work and access to funding  facing intimidation and even violent attacks.  The European Union was fully committed to the defence of civil society spaces and also strongly believed that the Human Rights Council must remain a safe space to express concerns.  Human rights were not something separate or technical to be relegated to mechanisms and experts  she said.  Human rights  she said in conclusion  provided the basic guidance for all areas of the Organization’s work. MARIA-VIRGINIA BRAS GOMES  Rapporteur of the Committee on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  read out a statement on behalf of its Chair  Zdzislaw Kedzia.  She said two years ago  the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly had granted the Committee additional meeting time to address a growing backlog of State party reports.  That  in combination with fewer meetings for the consideration of each report  had enabled the Committee to reduce the number of pending reports.  Further  following General Assembly resolution 68/268  the Committee would have additional time for the 2015-2017 period  which would eliminate the backlog gradually. Emphasizing the crucial importance of building capacities at the country level  she added that the General Assembly  through resolution 68/268  had referred to direct assistance to States parties at the national level by building and developing institutional capacity for reporting and strengthening technical knowledge through ad hoc training.  Further  the General Assembly had called on Member States to cooperate with regional human rights mechanisms  developing a roster of experts on treaty body reporting and facilitating the sharing of best practices among States parties. Noting continuing progress in the ratification of the Optional Protocol  she added that the number of States parties to that instrument had now reached the level of 16.  In conclusion  she stressed that the post-2015 development agenda must be linked functionally with human rights  particularly economic  social and cultural rights.  The individual must be at the heart of that agenda so that the new goals  indicators and benchmarks would be explicitly aligned with human rights principles and standards. Delegates from Argentina  Belgium  Chile  China  Costa Rica  Cuba  Lao  Norway  South Africa  Switzerland  as well as the European Union then asked about several matters  including the best ways to increase the efficiency of the treaty bodies system and how austerity measures taken by States as a result of the global financial crisis may have affected the delivery of economic  social and cultural rights.  Delegates also asked how the Committee planned to deal with overdue reports and emphasized that optional protocols must be ratified as widely as possible and that the protection of rights must begin at the national level  with international mechanisms monitoring their implementation. Responding  Ms. GOMES said that enhancing working methods was a high priority for her Committee  and General Assembly resolution 68/268 had supported that.  By improving time management and the quality of the dialogue with States parties  the Committee was planning to deal with its backlog.  In order to deal with overdue reports  the Committee would be reminding States parties that it was in their interest to meet their reporting obligations as it was an opportunity to analyse their public policies and dialogue with civil society. Continuing  she said the Committee was developing a more consistent approach to indicators and benchmarks.  Austerity measures had resulted in cutting down social spending  which had negatively affected the implementation of social and cultural rights.  In May 2012  the Chair of the Committee had written a letter to the States parties to remind them of their obligations  especially in times of crisis.  Policy changes in response to financial crises must still meet the minimum standard of rights  she stressed. NIGEL RODLEY  Chair of the Human Rights Committee  presented that body’s annual report  saying the failure to promote and protect all human rights contributed to the root causes of escalating violence in certain regions of the world.  In that regard  the Committee had assisted States parties in meeting their obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  The General Assembly’s support marked a turning point in the recognition of the treaty bodies and the need to ensure they were all sufficiently resourced. Since the previous General Assembly  he said  the Committee had undertaken a substantial amount of work  including the adoption of decisions on 94 communications  an increase of 22 per cent over the norm of recent years.  Stressing that a lack of implementation undermined the Committee’s credibility  he encouraged all States parties to give great weight to the Committee’s advice and to follow through on its recommendations. The Committee was constantly revising its working methods to make it more efficient  he continued.  Two recommendations in response to General Assembly resolution 68/268 offered ways and means for States as well as the Committee to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  Furthermore  the Committee hoped to adopt its General Comment on Article 9 relating to the right to liberty and security of persons at its current session.  Concluding  he recalled the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  aiming at the abolition of the death penalty  and reiterated the appreciation for the support States parties had provided. Mr. RODLEY then responded to a question posed by a representative of the European Union about challenges in the implementation of the General Assembly resolution and heard comments from a delegate of Belarus  who spoke about the role of civil society in the Committee report.  He said the Committee had very little experience in evaluating the preliminary assessment.  Translating reports and the issue of “using time efficiently” were among other challenges they faced  he continued.  In that regard  States were grateful when the Committee spent extra time to cover the State delegates and questions as more participation meant more justice.  Furthermore  he said the Committee was given power to adopt its own rules and procedures  which were available to the public.  In addition  he said the Committee had the right to decide on the registration of cases and their admissibility procedures. He also responded to questions raised by representatives of Switzerland and Norway asking about the best way to deal with acts of intimidation and reprisal against human rights defenders and how civil and political rights could best be represented in the post-2015 development agenda.  On reprisals  he said that such issues were taken up during the session and in concluding observations.  But there was a whole menu of further actions  including drawing the matter to the attention of the Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders.  Further  the Secretariat’s annual report on reprisals could also reflect the problems that the treaty bodies had encountered. Turning to the question of the post-2015 development agenda  he added that the treaty bodies as a whole had come up with a set of principles that they wished to see reflected in the agenda.  It was not clear what the fate of those recommendations was.  It would be extremely deleterious to the human rights project if the guarantees of good governance and civil and political rights were not fully and visibly reflected in the post-2015 agenda  he said. Statements SEBASTIANO CARDI (Italy) said his country had been at the forefront of a cross-regional coalition that had brought the question of the death penalty to the General Assembly in 2007.  As negotiations began for the fifth resolution establishing a moratorium on the use of the death penalty  Italy stood ready to offer its experience.  The aim of the resolution was not to indict any one system or culture.  Italy was also committed to the promotion of interreligious and intercultural dialogue.  His country was convinced that religion could play a pivotal role in preventing conflicts. MAYANK JOSHI (India)  welcoming resolution 68/268  which aimed at strengthening the human rights treaty body system  said that his country was a State party to the principal covenants on human rights and practically all other major human rights instruments.  While the Constitution of India guaranteed its citizens fundamental civil and political rights  an independent judiciary  a progressive Parliament and a free media had reinforced those safeguards.  His Government’s priority was to ensure sustained  inclusive socio-economic development with special attention on gender issues.  Further  in a paradigm shift from a welfare to a rights-based approach  India had enacted the landmark National Food Security Act of 2013. THIPHASONE SENGSOURINHA (Lao People’s Democratic Republic) said his Government was implementing different policies  strategies  programmes and projects to create necessary conditions for the enjoyment of human rights for its citizens.  National reporting mechanisms had also been enhanced by setting up committees and commissions for the purpose of reporting.  Awareness-raising and the dissemination of information on human rights treaties as well as the observations and comments from the treaty bodies and the Universal Peer Review were among the main focuses on human rights issues in his country  he added.  ARINO YAGUCHI (Japan) said that her country  under the leadership of Prime Minister Shinzō Abe  had been engaging enthusiastically in measures promoting women’s rights.  Japan was also faithfully implementing the Universal Periodic Review and all relevant international human rights treaties.  Further  the country had ratified the Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2014 and had set a target to increase the proportion of women in leading positions in the political and public sectors to at least 30 per cent by 2020. JUANA SANDOVAL (Nicaragua) said her Government was committed to guaranteeing human rights  ensuring the well-being of all its citizens.  Nicaragua was making efforts to eliminate poverty  which was a major challenge for her country to protect human rights. The Government was also taking necessary steps to eliminate all types of human rights violations  specifically related to violence against women  sexual diversity and people living with HIV/AIDS.  Further  the Government had carried out significant activities  including continuous learning on ethnics  police activities  prison system efforts and a code on children and adolescents.  It was also important  she said  that the Government had set up a national mechanism for the prevention of torture and was working with community organizations.  Concluding  she reiterated her country’s commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights. FOUROUZANDEH VADIATI (Iran) said his Government had presented and defended  over the course of the past three years  its periodic reviews.  No ready-made model for human rights should be imposed on States  he continued.  He then called on the international community to deepen a common understanding of universal human rights and allow different cultures and civilizations to follow their own interpretations.  Turning to sanctions  he called on the High Commissioner for Human Rights to condemn them as a violation of the United Nations Charter and international human rights law  including the rights to development  to health and to food. REN XIAOXIA (China) said that her country supported various human rights treaty bodies and had fulfilled its obligations in good faith.  Over the past two years  China had conducted dialogues with the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on Economic  Cultural and Social Rights.  Turning to resolution 68/268  she added that its effective implementation hinged on good communication between States parties  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and human rights treaty bodies.  While States parties were obliged to comply with reporting requirements  any requests beyond the scope of the Convention and without consent of States parties would increase the burden and make it harder for them to implement the Convention.  Further  all responsible international mechanisms should be subjected to effective monitoring.  Treaty bodies should be accountable as well  she said  and should carry out their work objectively and without exceeding their mandates.  While non-governmental organizations could play a useful role in promoting human rights  it was necessary for treaty bodies to screen the information submitted by them for veracity. DINARA IZANOVA (Kazakhstan) said that her country had ratified most human rights treaties and was working on bringing national legislation in line with the Conventions.  Kazakhstan was currently considering ratifying the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Welcoming measures to improve the effectiveness of treaty bodies and to provide technical assistance to countries  she said that it was vital to promote religious cooperation.  Accordingly  Kazakhstan was organizing a meeting of leaders of traditional religions.  Further  Kazakhstan was especially concerned about the rights of children and was considering establishing an ombudsman institute to enhance their protection. PHILLIP TAULA (New Zealand) welcomed the establishment of a mandate for a Special Rapporteur for persons with disabilities by the Human Rights Council  saying it was another step towards bridging the gap between simple words and the actual realization for the rights of all persons.  Since persons with disabilities were often disproportionately represented among those left behind in the development process  he emphasized the importance of mainstreaming disability issues as an integral part of relevant strategies on sustainable development. INTISAR NASSER MOHAMMED ABDULLAH (Yemen) said continuous progress in legislation  reflected in the Constitution  gave human rights a strong foundation in her country.  The Government had adopted a number of measures in line with international criteria and had taken steady steps acceding to such instruments as the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court  the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others.  Her country also paid particular attention and enacted laws to protect the rights of special groups  such as children  women  refugees  persons with disabilities and the elderly.  She noted that the Government was working with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to ensure children’s rights.  In closing  she drew attention to the situation of Yemeni detainees held at Guantanamo Bay  particularly those not involved in committing any offences. OUINIBANI KONATE (Burkina Faso) said his delegation endorsed the statements delivered on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China and the African Group.  His Government had made significant progress in terms of rewriting its criminal code  which ensured civil and political rights.  Underlining the link between the promotion of human rights and development  he noted that the Government had implemented its national development strategy  providing free education  health care and vaccination.  However  despite efforts and progress  his country had faced challenges regarding living conditions  which had had a negative impact on the promotion and protection of human rights. JEANNE D’ARC BYAJE (Rwanda) said that given the dark history of her country  the issue of human rights was very important to her Government  and the Constitution was based on principles of equal rights and equal treatment of all citizens.  An independent institution  the Rwanda Governance Board  regulated and guaranteed the rights of political parties  faith-based organizations and non-governmental organizations and the country had held several free and fair elections at all levels. The death penalty had been abolished  which she called “a necessary decision for a country rebuilding itself from genocide”.  Rwandan citizens could access legal aid through different mechanisms and the justice system had been restored to meet internationals standards.  Media outlets  including online ones  continued to grow  she said  as the vibrant civil society of her country played an active role in  among other things  assisting victims of human rights violations and fostering a culture of accountability. ENKHTSETSEG OCHIR (Mongolia) recognized the centrality of human rights in development and acknowledged that human rights  the rule of law and democracy were interlinked and mutually reinforcing.  Recognizing the unique role played by the Universal Periodic Review mechanism  she said her Government had adopted an action plan to follow those recommendations on its first national report and had been engaging all relevant stakeholders.  Mongolia supported the principles of non-selectivity  universality and indivisibility of human rights and firmly believed that the promotion and protection of human rights should be based on the principle of cooperation and genuine dialogue. INDAH NURIA SAVITRI (Indonesia) said that her country believed it imperative that every dialogue between a State party and a treaty body provided added value in a holistic manner.  However  it was vital that members of the treaty bodies maintained their independence and accountability to improve the effectiveness of the system.  The High Commissioner for Human Rights and his Office was an important partner in the international community’s endeavour to protect human rights.  It was crucial to provide the political and financial support the Office needed to function fully and effectively.  Indonesia stood ready to engage with treaty bodies and had undergone a review process with the Human Rights Council in May 2012.  Her country had also welcomed the visits of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights defenders and other special mandate holders  and was now implementing its third human rights action plan for the 2011-2015 period. ROBERT ALEXANDER POVEDA BRITO (Venezuela) said that his Government had created various institutions to support economic  social and cultural rights and the culture of human rights was becoming stronger day by day.  The Constitution guaranteed the human rights of all people  including vulnerable groups  such as indigenous people.  In 2011  Venezuela had joined various optional protocols  including the one on the Convention on Torture.  To date  Venezuela had presented a number of country reports.  The poverty level in the country had reduced significantly over the last 15 years  thanks to public policies that placed the individual at the heart.  Further  all citizens had the right to free expression of ideas and Venezuela’s democracy was based on diversity of views  pluralism and democratic media. SAHAK SARGSYAN (Armenia) said that his country had made undeniable progress in advancing human rights thanks to numerous measures  such as the strategic gender policy.  A national strategy on human rights protection was adopted in October 2012 and the country also fully respected the office of the ombudsman and a recently established office to defend women’s rights.  “Cruelty and violence would never contribute to human progress ” he stressed.  As a party to the Convention on Torture  Armenia strongly believed in the need to condemn torture wherever it took place and whatever form it took.  His country was shocked by the tragic death of one of its citizens while in custody in Baku.  Karen Petrosyan had been publicly humiliated and killed by the authorities of Azerbaijan and it was announced that he was an Armenian saboteur.  Such deplorable acts must be investigated and perpetrators must be held accountable. KEVIN CASSIDY  of the International Labour Organization  said international labour standards were integral to the larger international human rights framework.  The Organization’s eight core fundamental conventions  he continued  were also human rights instruments that addressed such challenges as forced labour  child labour  discrimination in employment and occupation  freedom of association and collective bargaining.  Further  he noted that its Domestic Workers Convention addressed the deplorable working conditions  labour exploitation  and human rights abuses faced by the 53 million domestic workers worldwide.  It was also active in eradicating forced labour and human trafficking  which affected the most vulnerable and least protected people.  Concluding  he called on Member States to ratify the new Protocol on Forced Labour and to continue their efforts in protecting the most vulnerable in society through the equal provision and application of human rights. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-21,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gadis3507.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. An unimplemented Nuclear-Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was nothing but a “place-holder” for disarmament that told States to “insert effective measures for nuclear disarmament here”  heard members of the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) today during a thematic debate on nuclear weapons. The international community’s record of implementing disarmament obligations was so poor  said the representative of Ireland  that questions must be asked about the seriousness of its collective commitment to article VI of that Treaty and the overall goal of a world without nuclear weapons.  No disarmament treaty could possibly function on those terms  she added. The representative of the Russian Federation  offering his country’s perspective on the road map to nuclear disarmament  said it stood behind the consensus 2010 NPT Action Plan.  Any attempts to undermine the review process with the aim of launching alternative dialogues  without taking into account the opinions of nuclear-weapon States  would be “doomed to failure”. Despite the “unprecedented” track record of the Russian Federation and United States in reciprocal reductions of strategic arsenals  he said it was no secret to anyone that within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  joint nuclear-sharing missions were still being developed.  Moreover  the non-nuclear members of the alliance were receiving nuclear weapons on their territories and training in launching nuclear strikes on the Russian Federation.  Speaking on behalf of the Group of Arab States  the representative of Egypt denounced Israel for not acceding to the NPT and stalling the process of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free-zone in the Middle East.  That country could not “reverse the course of history”  he said  calling any delays on that issue “unjustifiable”  since ridding the region of those weapons was critical. A zone free of nuclear weapons  said Israel’s representative  must emanate from direct negotiations and consensus-building.  Disturbing realities in the Middle East required a step-by-step approach and such zones could only begin with modest arrangements for confidence and security-building measures.  Israel’s national policy on nuclear matters had always been one of responsibility and restraint  consonant with the underlying goals and principles of non-proliferation  she said. Shifting to conventional weapons  the Committee heard from several Groups representing a broad contingent as it began its thematic debate on that cluster. Speaking for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  the representative of Guyana said that small arms and light weapons continued to cause irreparable harm to people around the world  and posed a major threat to the safety  security and development of his region.  The transnational nature of the flow of those weapons required a multi-national effort  he said  commending the coming entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty as an important step. Similarly  the representative of Indonesia  speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  said his Group remained deeply concerned over the illicit manufacture  transfer and circulation of those weapons and called on all States to ensure that their supply was limited to Governments or entities authorized to use them.  Asserting a “significant imbalance” between the industrialized and Non-Aligned countries  he called for a reduction in conventional weapons by the former group in order to enhance international and peace and security. Sharing the perspective of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  the representative of Mali said that the illicit trade and circulation of small arms and light weapons continued to sustain a number of “theatres of conflict” around the world  exacerbating violence and contributing to civilian displacement.  Those fed terrorism and organized crime  and were the weapons most frequently used in armed conflicts.  Combatting proliferation would only be effective if it was carried out in cooperation synergistically with all concerned.  During the course of the meeting  delegations introduced draft resolutions on forwarding multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations; a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East; the danger of nuclear weapons; the Hague Code of Conduct on missiles; and assistance to states for curbing the illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons and collecting them. Also speaking during the cluster on nuclear weapons were representatives of Turkey  Ecuador  Australia  Peru  Republic of Korea  Finland  Spain  Algeria  Bahrain  Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  Slovenia  Syria  Morocco  and the United Republic of Tanzania. The representatives of the Russian Federation  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  Japan and the Republic of Korea spoke in exercise of the right of reply on the nuclear weapons cluster. During the discussion on conventional weapons  the representative of Suriname (on behalf of UNASUR) also spoke  as did the representative of the European Union.   The Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. tomorrow  22 October  to continue its thematic debate on conventional weapons. Background The First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) met today to conclude its thematic debate on nuclear weapons and begin consideration of conventional weapons.  For more background  see Press Release GA/DIS/3497. Nuclear Weapons Thematic Debate BREIFNE O’REILLY (Ireland)  associating with the New Agenda Coalition  introduced “L.21” entitled  “Taking forward multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations”.  He said that the international community’s record of implementing disarmament obligations was so poor that questions must soon be asked about the seriousness of its collective commitment to the NPT’s article VI and the overall goal of a world without nuclear weapons.  What the world had was a “place-holder for disarmament”  effectively telling States to “insert effective measures for nuclear disarmament here”.  However  no disarmament treaty could possibly function on those terms. He said the Chemical Weapons Convention could not ever have arrived at a point where it had all but eliminated an entire category of vicious  inhumane weapons if it had not set out a framework of clearly defining prohibitions and obligations  a functioning verification system and multilateral decision-making organs to oversee the process.  Likewise  the recent destruction of Syrian chemical weapons could not have been dealt with so resolutely and quickly if the Chemical Weapons Convention contained nothing more than a request for States to pursue negotiations in good faith towards effective chemical weapons destruction. That raised troubling questions with regard to nuclear weapons  he said. The international community’s apparent willingness to go along with the status quo  which did not envisage nuclear weapon disarmament in the near-  medium- or even long-term future  seemed to suggest that those weapons were somehow more “necessary” or “legitimate” or “justifiable” than chemical or biological weapons.  That was “most certainly” not Ireland’s position  even if some States had wielded chemical weapons as their presumably ultimate deterrent.  Those weapons were now rightly held up as the object of revulsion and as illegitimate weapon of war.  Why then  he asked  was it that nuclear weapons were not seen in the same way.  “Is it more respectable to retain the capacity to kill civilians on a large scale by incineration and radiation than by nerve agents?” he asked. He said that while the world was told that “conditions were not yet in place” for nuclear disarmament  that was in fact an indirect invitation to proliferate.  Ireland did not accept the doctrine of nuclear deterrence  nor did it accept that nuclear weapons had kept the world safe during the cold war or at any other time since 1945.  While some might ask what the “hidden agenda” was behind the humanitarian consequences initiative  the answer was simple — it was solely and exclusively aimed at fulfilment of the NPT’s obligations. Amr Abdellatif Aboulatta (Egypt)  speaking on behalf of the Group of Arab States and supporting the statement of the Non-Aligned Movement  called for the convening of a high-level conference on nuclear disarmament by 2018 at the latest.  The Arab States had actively participated in all nuclear disarmament forums and had all joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  thereby subjecting themselves to the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  However  those steps had not been mirrored by Israel  which was the only State in the region that had not yet to acceded to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon State.  Nor had it subjected itself to IAEA safeguards or adhered to the 2010 NPT Action Plan.  Israel “cannot reverse the course of history ” he said  adding that Arab States must stress the urgent need to rid the region of nuclear weapons. Towards that end  turning the Middle East into a nuclear-weapon-free zone was critical.  The delays in holding a conference on that issue were “unjustifiable”  and he urged all parties to assume their responsibilities in that regard. At the same time  he said  discussions should be pursued on fissile materials with the aim of outlawing them for nuclear weapons use.  That issue  the international community agreed in principle  should be a part of the 2015 NPT Review Conference.  It was time to “get down to business”.  As the First Committee was collectively responsible for helping achieve a nuclear-weapon-free zone in his region  the Arab group would table a resolution on the matter  for which it sought a “no vote” adoption.  The joint report presented by Iraq reflected the Group’s opinion.  In addition  the Group had introduced a resolution on the danger of nuclear weapons  reaffirming the importance of Israel’s accession to the NPT.  It also must agree to IAEA safeguards  which would bolster confidence in the region and be a huge step towards achieving peace there. EFE CEYLAN (Turkey)  speaking in his national capacity  urged State parties to the NPT to reaffirm and uphold their commitment to the fulfilment of the legal and political obligations contained in the three pillars of disarmament  non-proliferation and peaceful use establishing the regime’s “grand bargain”.  Turkey supported calls for systematic  progressive and irreversible nuclear disarmament.  The establishment of weapons-of-mass-destruction-free zones  including the Middle East  was an important confidence-building measure.  The country stressed the centrality of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  whose entry into force the international community had spent enough time waiting for.  Starting negotiations on the fissile material cut-off treaty would pave the way for parallel advances in other core agenda items of the Conference on Disarmament.  Welcoming statements delivered earlier by New Zealand and Australia on behalf of groups of countries on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons  Turkey was satisfied with the growing awareness of the catastrophic consequences of the possible use of such weapons. FERNANDO LUQUE MARQUEZ (Ecuador)  associating with the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) and the Non-Aligned Movement said his country’s Constitution  which proclaimed his country as a zone of peace  unequivocally condemned the use of weapons of mass destruction.  That permanent proclamation was expressed through Ecuador’s active participation in the establishment of the first nuclear-weapon-free zone in a densely populated area through the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean  known as the Treaty of Tlatelolco.  The expansion of and increase in the number of nuclear-weapon-free zones was an important step forward on a road that should lead to the total elimination of such weapons.  It was unfortunate that the international community had not yet held a conference for the creation of a zone free of nuclear and other mass destruction weapons in the Middle East. The signing of the NPT had three goals  he said  which were to prevent proliferation  allow States to pursue peaceful uses of nuclear energy  and the elimination of the arsenals of nuclear-weapon States.  Negotiations on a multilateral treaty should begin.  The mechanisms for agreeing on that universal treaty existed; missing  however  was the political will.  There had been several initiatives over the past years showing that the international community continued to place a high priority on nuclear disarmament.  The horrors of such weapons  which were witnessed by all in Hiroshima and Nagasaki  had been enough for the world to declare “enough”.  The international community should take all the necessary steps to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons. JOHN QUINN (Australia)  speaking in his national capacity  said that reducing the numbers of nuclear weapons was a key requirement for making the world safer.  It was also a key aspect of nuclear transparency  and  along with members of the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative  his country had argued that transparency about nuclear arsenals was crucial for building confidence.  Including the non-NPT nuclear-armed States in a global move towards nuclear transparency was also important.  Another concern was the development of smaller-battlefield-deployable nuclear weapons  as their use in conflict would likely escalate it to a full-scale-nuclear exchange.  His country welcomed the renewed focus on humanitarian consequences  as well as the continued discussion by the five NPT nuclear-weapon States on their commitments. “We are collectively following a long and hard road  and there are no shortcuts to achieving our goal of eventual nuclear disarmament ” he said  noting some positive steps towards the entry into force of the CTBT and ripening negotiations for a fissile material cut-off treaty.  The establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction remained a priority.  Australia also shared the international community’s concerns about the possible military dimension of Iran’s nuclear programme and welcomed ongoing discussions between Iran and P5+1  as well as the work of the IAEA in Iran.  He also called on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to abandon its nuclear weapon and missile development programmes. PENA DOIG (Peru)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  introduced a draft resolution reaffirming the importance of the International Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation  aimed at building transparency.  She said the draft resolution was based on a previous text on the matter  but this one reflected the most recent developments.  Additionally  it highlighted efforts to ensure the Code’s universalization and called on States that had not subscribed to the mechanism to do so.  The objective was to ensure the Code’s full implementation and strengthen awareness among States that had not yet subscribed to it.  Peru requested broad support for the draft resolution  as well as the co-sponsorship of States that had subscribed to the Code. VLADIMIR YERMAKOV (Russian Federation) said that the broad opinions expressed on the nuclear weapons cluster were encouraging in that many delegations had given pride of pace to the NPT.  In May next year  in New York  the whole world would be marking the seventieth anniversary of the victory over the brown-shirted plague of Nazism during the Second World War.  However  some seemed to forget that his country had lost 30 million of its own citizens in that conflict.  With this in mind  the Russian Federation valued peace and strategic stability based on the principles of security for all States  respect for national interests and the upholding of the standards of international law perhaps more than any other State. Nevertheless  he said his country shared the aspirations of freeing the world from nuclear weapons.  The Russian Federation had gone through unprecedented nuclear disarmament and reductions in arsenals by almost 90 per cent.  That had brought the stock to its minimal sufficient level.  Additionally  his country kept its nuclear weapons exclusively on its own national territory in full safety and security.  It was well aware of who had started the nuclear arms race  and did not intend to repeat the mistakes of the past. Currently in the field of nuclear disarmament  he noted  the Russian Federation and the United States had an unprecedented track record in reaching agreements through the New START  carrying out major steps in reciprocal reductions of strategic arsenals  even in the most critical situation.  However  it was “odious” to see the military nuclear bloc of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) edging closer to Russian borders.  It was no secret to anyone that within NATO  there was still the development of joint nuclear-sharing missions.  Moreover  the non-nuclear members of the alliance were receiving nuclear weapons on their territories  as well as training in launching nuclear strikes on the Russian Federation. It would be insane  he said  to think that the Russian Federation would simply close its eyes to all such increasing threats to her national security. For Russia  the nuclear disarmament road map was the consensus outcome document of the NPT Action Plan.  Any attempts to undermine the NPT review process with the aim of launching alternative dialogues  without taking into account the opinions of the nuclear-weapon States  would be doomed to failure. ANH YOUNG-JIP (Republic of Korea) said that  given the wide gap between the approaches of nuclear and non-nuclear-weapon States on ways to rid the world of those weapons  the world community should be practical and realistic  moving away from an “all or nothing” approach.  Taking note of significant progress in the reduction of nuclear arsenals  he said ongoing efforts to enhance transparency and build confidence through “P5” dialogue appeared to have a positive effect.  Much remained to be done  however  including ensuring that the CTBT came into force and that negotiations began on a treaty banning the production of fissile material.  Countering possible nuclear-weapon proliferation to non-State actors and strengthening nuclear security and safety capacity were urgent tasks.  The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear programme was a threat to the security of the region and beyond  he said  urging that country to abandon its programme for the sake of economic prosperity. JANNE TAALAS (Finland)  associating with the European Union  said that working towards a world free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction was the responsibility of all nations.  That would require decreased tensions and increased confidence  as well as the robust implementation of the many existing agreements.  To achieve progress in nuclear disarmament  a stronger sense of urgency was needed  he said  welcoming the joint statement presented by New Zealand on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons.  Eliminating those weapons was the only possible solution  through substantive and constructive engagement with nuclear-weapon States.  On the conference to establish a nuclear-weapon-free-zone in the Middle East  he noted that some important developments had taken place.  Together with States in the region and the facilitator and conveners of the Helsinki Conference  five informal meetings had been held in Switzerland.  Some progress on the arrangements of the conference had been reached; consensus and political will was now required.  As the host Government  Finland stood prepared to convene the conference on short notice  he added.  JULIO HERRAIZ (Spain)  associating with the European Union  highlighted the importance of the NPT and adherence to its three pillars  which needed to be implemented in a balanced and complementary manner.  It was necessary to develop the 2010 Action Plan  which should be carried out in a realistic fashion.  State sovereignty should not be infringed upon  and there should be a framework of trust to enable the international community to build on commitments made.  All actors must take part in the process.  He urged implementation of the various initiatives recently undertaken by the international community concerning the consequences of nuclear weapons. Regarding the regional proliferation crisis and Iran  he said Spain supported efforts to reach a diplomatic solution  urging that full advantage be taken of the negotiating process.  He called on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to abandon its nuclear programmes in their entirety  and also highlighted the importance of the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones.  In that light he supported the holding of a conference for such a zone in the Middle East.  Countries should be able to develop their nuclear energy for peaceful purposes  in strict compliance with international commitments.  The IAEA had a key role in that in the context of its safeguards and Additional Protocol.  He also highlighted the importance of verification.  Regarding the NPT  he hoped all States would work to make real progress on the goals set in 2010. Zaina Benhabouche (Algeria)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  the Arab and African Groups  reaffirmed that nuclear disarmament remained its highest priority.  She was seriously concerned about the danger those weapons posed to humanity.  Algeria supported the Movement’s road map  which called for the urgent commencement of negotiations of a comprehensive convention banning nuclear weapons.  She reiterated Algeria’s commitment to the NPT and underlined that efforts aimed at nuclear non-proliferation should run parallel with efforts towards nuclear disarmament.  At the same time  she reaffirmed the legitimate right of States to produce research  produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under the non-proliferation regime.  She went on to express support for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East  pointing to the African Nuclear-Weapon Free Zone Treaty as an example that should be followed.  FATEMS MANDEEL (Bahrain)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and Arab Group  reaffirmed strong support for dismantling weapons of mass destruction.  Peace  security and stability required the world to eliminate nuclear and other mass destruction weapons  and to stop their production and proliferation.  The United Nations played a key role in that regard  but more discussions were necessary.  A conference should be held on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East as soon as possible.  Bahrain looked forward to an increased exchange of knowledge and technology to further the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  That was part of an effort to ensure that all countries respected the IAEA  and those that had not done so should place their facilities under the Agency’s safeguards.  Iran should fulfil its NPT commitments  and Israel should place its nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards.  Weapons of mass destruction must not fall into the hands of terrorists  she said  urging all nuclear weapon-producing countries to take precautionary measures. KIM JU SONG (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) said it was clear the international community desired comprehensive and complete nuclear disarmament.  In that regard  the “posture” of some nuclear-weapon States of denying and delaying ran counter to the broad desire for the total elimination of nuclear weapons.  Further  the lack of progress in the Conference for Disarmament was due to adherence by some nuclear-armed States to “one-sided” proliferation efforts.  That double standard clearly demonstrated the real purpose of the non-proliferation regime; that loud clamouring by those States  he said  which was to misuse the non-proliferation instruments for attacking sovereign countries.  Under the guise of non-proliferation  those countries were “persistently clinging” to hostile policies and manoeuvres aimed at overthrowing regimes and crushing countries that were “out of taste”. He said that nuclear modernization pursued by nuclear Powers was entering a “dangerous stage” of a pre-emptive nuclear attack.  In particular  the world’s top nuclear Power was engaging in nuclear “blackmail”  conducting nuclear-war exercises against a dignified United Nations Member State.  In that context  a comprehensive international convention banning nuclear blackmail and the complete destruction of nuclear weapons were vital.  The total elimination of nuclear weapons and global denuclearization was his country’s consistent position.  Turning to Japan  he highlighted the recent Stockholm Agreement  which clearly stated the responsibilities of both parties.  Its implementation would depend on the attitude of Japan  he added. Boštjan Jerman (Slovenia)  associating with the European Union  said his country was a staunch supporter of effective multilateralism.  A world free of nuclear weapons should not be just a vision  but rather a concrete goal and final objective of the international community’s efforts.  The NPT should remain the framework for those efforts  and his delegation believed that a positive outcome of the next Review Conference was feasible.  Negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty in the Conference on Disarmament should be a first priority  and he called on Conference members to begin those negotiations as soon as possible.  Regarding the recent initiative on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons  the Conferences held in Mexico and Norway had broadened Slovenia’s understanding of that phenomenon. Bashar Ja’afarI (Syria) condemned the fact that the 2012 conference for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East had not taken place  and called for the meeting to be convened by the end of the year.  At the same time  he urged the international community to exert pressure on Israel to accede to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon State and subject its nuclear facilities to IAEA safeguards.  He denounced the protection that Israel continued to enjoy  stressing that the country was not a party to the NPT or other important treaties.  Previously  France had provided a uranium reactor to Israel as well as missiles  and other States had contributed to Israel’s nuclear programme  which continued to develop as certain States refused to recognize it as a threat. He went on to affirm the inalienable right of States to acquire and develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes under IAEA control.  To prove that the country was against the use of chemical weapons  Syria had adhered to the obligations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and successfully honoured its commitments  despite challenging conditions. ISMAIL CHEKKORI (Morocco)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  as well as the African and Arab Groups  stressed that nuclear weapons were not a guarantee of security.  That  he said  resided in dialogue and partnership  which  in turn  would foster sustainable development.  Nuclear weapons were the only weapons of mass destruction that had not been subjected to global prohibition  he said  adding that his country was hopeful that the Vienna conference would reinvigorate that process.  Morocco subscribed to New Zealand’s statement on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons and believed that implementation of the outcomes of the NPT Review Conference in 2010 was of “vital importance”.  Despite efforts made  the international community remained a long away from a process that would lead to a world free of nuclear weapons.  Efforts must be stepped up to ensure the success of the May 2015 NPT Review Conference  and its universal ratification was crucial  as that would strengthen the non-proliferation regime and pave the way for a nuclear-weapon-free world. RAMADHAN M. MWINYI (United Republic of Tanzania)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and African Group  said that in order to achieve the purpose of the NPT  the IAEA must retain its vital role  including in encouraging the peaceful use of nuclear energy.  Also crucial was the creation of an environment conducive to nuclear cooperation.  He called on that Agency to ensure that education on nuclear technology was equally provided to all Member States  in good faith without discrimination  and urged countries with nuclear arsenals to comply with NPT provisions.  He commended the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones  as invaluable contributions to international peace and security  and joined calls for such a zone in the Middle East. He regretted that nuclear-weapon States were reluctant to offer negative security assurances  and called on those States to offer a legally-binding agreement to that end. Alifeleti Soakai (Palau)  associating with the Pacific Small Island Developing States  said his country had a particular interest in advancing nuclear disarmament as it had experienced first-hand the devastating impact of nuclear arms.  In that regard  Palau stood in solidarity with the Marshall Islands in its legal proceedings before the International Court of Justice to compel nuclear-armed States to fulfil their legal obligation to disarm.  The time had come for a new diplomatic process to negotiate a legally-binding instrument that prohibited  not only the use of threat of use of nuclear weapons  but also their production  deployment  transfer and stockpiling.  By banning nuclear weapons  the international community would devalue and stigmatize them  a necessary first step towards their complete elimination  he said. MICHAL SEHAYEK-SOROKA (Israel) said her national policy in the nuclear domain had always been one of responsibility and restraint  and was consonant with the underlying goals and principles of non-proliferation  including those expressed in the NPT.  Unfortunately  it had been clearly demonstrated in the Middle East in recent years that NPT did not provide a guarantee that those non-proliferation principles would be implemented and adhered to  nor address the unique security challenges of the region.  The Treaty had certainly not prevented substantial violations of its obligations by several Middle East member States  and had not sufficiently remedied those violations once they were discovered. She said that NPT membership was not a goal in itself  and that of critical importance was for the treaty to be respected by those countries that had joined it.  Calls for universal adherence to the NPT must be judged against the Middle East’s region-specific characteristics and particularly the fact that the vast majority of members of the Arab Group continued to refuse to recognize Israel as a sovereign State.  When Syria joined the NPT  it specifically stated that its accession did not imply recognition of Israel.  In that context  it was clear that Israel must give due consideration to the fact that four out of five cases of violation of the NPT took place in the Middle East  namely Iraq  Libya  Iran and Syria.  The fourth was the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Israel’s approach to regional security and arms control was rooted in its belief that all security concerns of regional members should be taken into account  she said.  A zone free of nuclear weapons could only emanate from within a region through direct negotiations and consensus-building.  The disturbing realities in the Middle East mandated a practical  step-by-step approach  and could only begin with modest arrangements for confidence and security-building measures to build necessary trust.  Regrettably  no regional security dialogue existed at present in the Middle East  nor was there a forum to develop confidence-building measures and defuse tensions.  Israel had expressed its commitment to sincere and open dialogue  and regretted the Arab Group’s decision to choose a path of confrontation rather than reconciliation. Right of Reply Speaking in exercise of the right of reply  the representative of the Russian Federation said the bare-faced accusations levelled at Russia did not contain an ounce of truth.  Concerning the theme of the commitments of the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 with regard to security guarantees to Ukraine following its accession to the NPT  he advised those taking that line to familiarize themselves with the text of that document.  A key provision was a negative assurance not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear-weapon State.  Regarding Crimea  he said that the loss by Ukraine of its territorial integrity was not a result of foreign interference.  Rather  it was an internal political crisis.  That could in no way be conflated with the Budapest Memorandum.  In Budapest  at the same time as the memorandum  a joint statement had been adopted by the Russian Federation  the United States and Ukraine to confirm the significance of commitments within the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to combat the growth of aggressive nationalism and chauvinism.  It was that joint statement that Ukraine violated by long abetting extremely aggressive ultra-nationalism. Even the European Parliament in 2010  he went on  had adopted a resolution on Ukraine  saying that racist  anti-Semitic and xenophobic groups in Ukraine were contradictory to the fundamental values of the European Union.  After the coup and violent overthrow of the lawfully elected President of Ukraine  it was those forces that came to power in Kyiv in 2014.  With their ultra-nationalism  they shattered the unity of Ukraine and drove a whole region “out of its constitution”.  In Crimea  97 per cent of voters wanted the independence of Crimea from Ukraine  and to return to the Russian Federation.  In  1994  Russia had not assumed any commitment to coerce any part of Ukraine to remain in its constitution without the will of the local population.  The Budapest Memorandum did not extend to the consequences of internal social political processes. Crimea’s reunification with the Russian Federation  through a direct national referendum  had taken place without a shot being fired  he said.  However  he was greatly troubled by the current Powers in Kyiv and their sponsors in the European Union and the United States  which had not learned any lessons from the past.  During the coup  those enacting it were killing law enforcement officers and setting fire to civic buildings in Kyiv - and those actions were called a struggle for democracy.  Yet when the citizens in the southeast of Ukraine wanted independence  they were labeled separatists and even terrorists.  The new Powers in Kyiv beset the civilian population with regular troops including air force  tanks  heavy artillery and ballistic missiles  which were especially striking in their cruelty.  There had been mass killings of civilians including women  children  the elderly and invalids  and there had been violence  looting and destruction of infrastructures  including maternity wards  schools and old peoples’ homes  with places being literally razed to the ground. All of that was happening in the territory of a major and potentially resource-rich European State that had been violently dragged under the control of NATO and the European Union  he said.  It was evident that those war crimes against humanity  and the effective genocide against the population in the southeast of Ukraine  was still being “played down” in the countries of the so-called Western democracies and described as outside the bounds of international humanitarian law.  It was as if the vaccine against brown-shirted plague of Nazism given during the Second World War was wearing off in some States  and it was sad that that Nazi nightmare was coming to the surface  even in the First Committee.  For those supporting the coup in Ukraine  it was just a bargaining chip in its geopolitical strategy.  For Russia  on the other hand  Ukraine was the closest and dearest  and part of its own culture and history. People living there had close family ties in Russia  and that must be borne in mind. Ukraine was close to Russia’s heart. Exercising his right of reply  the representative of the Republic of Korea said it could not accept the assertions made by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.  The Republic of Korea had been threatened many times by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  whose statements contradicted those made in other forums.  That country had carried out three nuclear tests and continued provocations this year  he said  adding that “the facts speak for themselves”.  It was that country that had escalated tensions in the region. Also exercising his right of reply  the representative of Japan responded to the statement of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to urge it  once again  to fully comply with its international commitments on related issues. The representative from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea said the former United States Secretary of Defence wrote in his memoir that he had informed the South Korean authorities in 2011 on the use “nukes” as a contingency against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.  That same American Defence Secretary had said he received a report from the commander in the Republic of Korea that a war scenario with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea included the use of nuclear weapons.  That was but another example of the “nuclear-grade” threat against his country by the United States. The United States  he went on  had employed a policy of nuclear blackmail since the 1950s  when that country’s “brigandish” nuclear threat had been put into practice.  Those realities proved that the United States’ nuclear blackmail was aimed at aggression and had entered a phase of practical strike  going beyond threat.  He called on the representative of the Republic of Korea to ask himself when it came to a nation  “what was dignity and what was shame”. Speaking in exercise of a second right of reply  the representative of the Republic of Korea said he would not respond to such baseless accusations  but wished to remind those present that the international community supported the relevant Security Council resolutions and the Joint Statement of 19 September 2005  which clearly stated that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was obliged to abandon all nuclear weapons and programmes  including uranium enrichment. Also speaking in a second right of reply  the representative of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea said he wished to clarify that his country had never recognized those so-called resolutions  which the representative from the Republic of Korea kept “sticking with”.  The security situation on the Korean peninsula was a result of the nuclear blackmail of the United States.  As long as that continued  it would be hard to expect peace and security there.  The Republic of Korea should not worry about the nuclear deterrence of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  but about the placement of nuclear materials on their own soil  which could push the peninsula to disaster.  Directing an “old Korean proverb” at the delegate from the Republic of Korea  he said  “that was the pot calling the kettle black”. Conventional Weapons Thematic Debate KAMAPRADIPTA ISNOMO (Indonesia)  on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  reaffirmed the sovereign right of States to acquire  manufacture  export  import and retain conventional arms and their parts and components for self-defence and security.  At the same time  the Movement was concerned about unilateral coercive measures  and emphasized that no “undue restriction” should be placed on the transfer of small arms and light weapons.  It also remained deeply concerned over the illicit manufacture  transfer and circulation of those weapons and called on all States to ensure that their supply was limited to Governments or entities authorized to use them.  Recognizing the “significant imbalance” between the industrialized and Non-Aligned countries  he called for a reduction in conventional weapons by industrialized States  with a view to enhancing international and peace and security. In anticipation of the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty  the Movement  he continued  called for its balanced  transparent and objective implementation  while reaffirming the inherent right of each State to security and collective self-defence.  The Movement also called on all States in the position to do so to provide the necessary assistance to landmine clearance operations  including resources  and the social and economic rehabilitation of victims.  The Movement also expressed solidarity with the cluster munitions-affected countries  calling for the necessary assistance to clear such weapons. El Hadji Alhousseini Traoré (Mali)  speaking in his national capacity and associating with the African Group and Non-Aligned Movement  recalled the need to strengthen multilateralism so that the international community could move forward its effort in disarmament and non–proliferation.  He deplored the erosion of multilateralism  but also pointed to recent successes.  The Arms Trade Treaty would soon enter into force  and this December  the international community would hold a conference in Vienna on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons. Speaking on behalf of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  he introduced a draft resolution on “assistance to states for curbing the illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons and collecting them”  or  “L.4”.  That illicit trade and circulation continued to sustain a number of theatres of conflict around the world  exacerbating violence and contributing to civilian displacement.  They fed terrorism and organized crime  and were the weapons most frequently used in armed conflicts.  Combatting their proliferation and illicit trade would only be effective if it was carried out synergistically in cooperation with all concerned.  He recognized the support given by the European Union to ECOWAS  including the allocation of €5.56 million to fight the circulation of those illicit weapons. GEORGE WILFRED TALBOT (Guyana)  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  said that the unregulated trade of illicit small arms continued to cause irreparable harm to people around the world  fuelling crime  conflict and humanitarian law violations.  The transnational nature of the flow of those weapons required a multi-national effort; in the Caribbean region  the illicit trade posed a major threat to its safety  security and development.  In that regard  the Community commended the coming entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty  which was an important step to curb the flow of light arms  he said  stressing that the Treaty was expected to make a significant difference in people’s lives in the Caribbean.  CARICOM was proud to have played a leading role in that Treaty’s success and confirmed that all 14 Member States had already signed it.  One of its members  Trinidad and Tobago  had also offered to host the Treaty’s secretariat  which had CARICOM’s full support. He said CARICOM welcomed the adoption of the outcome document of the small arms and light weapons Programme of Action’s review  which contained capacity-building measures for States to implement the Programme.  As implementation remained uneven across regions  the international community must ensure the instrument’s effective and broad implementation.  CARICOM supported exploring ways in which the implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty and the Programme of Action could be complementary.  The Community fully supported the Maputo+15 action plan on the prohibition of anti-personnel land mines  and urged full implementation of the Mine-Ban convention. MICHIEL RAAFENBERG (Suriname)  speaking on behalf of the Member States of UNASUR  recognized the contribution made by the United Nations Programme of Action in preventing the illicit trade in small arms by providing a comprehensive  multidimensional response to the problem.  However  UNASUR reiterated that the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons “in all its aspects” must include ammunition and explosives.  The working group on firearms and ammunition  established in 2001  had become a useful tool for the coordination of the positions of member and associated States of the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR).  UNASUR expressed its support of Colombia  South Africa  and Japan for the introduction of the draft resolution on the illicit small arms and light weapons trade  as it addressed issues related to the unregulated trade in conventional arms.  The Arms Trade Treaty contributed to the prevention of armed conflict and international law violations  and the Union urged its transparent implementation. He reiterated UNASUR’s support for the international community’s efforts to regulate cluster munitions and also reaffirmed the need to eliminate anti-personnel mines.  The UNASUR attached importance to the international cooperation and assistance framework of the Mine-Ban Convention and welcomed the documents adopted at the third review conference.  The Heads of State of UNASUR decided to strengthen South America as a zone of peace  committing to mutual confidence in security and defence.  They also reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening the cooperation and fight against terrorism and transnational organized crime. IOANNIS VRAILAS  representative of the European Union Delegation  welcoming the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty in December  said it would significantly contribute to international peace and security.  Recognizing that the Treaty’s effective implementation and universalization would be essential for its success and relevance  the Union had adopted an ambitious and tangible implementation support programme for countries in need  with overall funding of €6.4 million.  It also considered the United Nations Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons to be a key universal tool in addressing the challenges posed by the illicit trade and excessive accumulation of such weapons at the national  regional and global levels.  The Union would continue to call for theinclusion of ammunition as part of a comprehensive approach to controlling those weapons  he said  reiterating his commitment to promoting the Mine-Ban Convention. The European Union  he continued  had consistently supported international efforts addressing the humanitarian  socio-economic and security impact of conventional weapons and halting their indiscriminate use.  Expressing support for the humanitarian goal of the Convention on Cluster Munitions  he voiced deep concern about reports of alleged use of such munitions against civilian populations in Syria and called upon all concerned to refrain from such use.  There were similarly worrying reports concerning South Sudan and Ukraine.  With a view to strengthening international humanitarian law  the European Union remained firmly committed to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and its Protocols  and stressed the need for its universalization.  He highlighted the strong linkage with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  which provided a wider framework to address comprehensively the needs of survivors. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-21,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gal3484.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Faced with new challenges in protecting diplomatic and consular missions and representatives  speakers today called upon Member States to ensure compliance with the Vienna Conventions  as the Sixth Committee (Legal) today considered effective measures to enhance the protection  security and safety of those entities. A representative of the European Union Delegation  condemning recent attacks on the Indian Consulate in western Afghanistan and the Turkish Consulate in Mosul  as well as the abduction in Yemen of an Iran Embassy staff member  underscored that no attack on diplomatic and consular missions or their staff could be justified.  While receiving States were required  under the two Vienna Conventions  to take appropriate steps to protect diplomatic missions and consular premises  she said threats posed by terrorists and other armed groups also required particular attention. Syria’s representative said his country’s diplomatic and consular missions and their staff  worldwide  had suffered over the past four years.  Serious aggressions in the form of invasions  sabotage  destruction and looting  and physical attacks had negatively affected the safety of those missions and the ability of personnel to carry out their functions.  Echoing other delegations  he said that in all States where such incidents occurred  comprehensive investigations must be carried out. The representative of Costa Rica  speaking for the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  noted that the dramatic events that had taken place in recent years served as a reminder that the role of representing one’s country implied a risk to those who performed it.  There were also new challenges  including the impact that State surveillance and interception of communications might have on the inviolability of diplomatic and consular archives and documents. Echoing his counterpart  Brazil’s delegate said that the protection of archives  documents and communications  which were also covered by international law  must be considered in the Committee’s discussion.  The Vienna Conventions affirmed that such documents were inviolable “wherever they may be”  he said  pointing out that such texts now existed on digital platforms as well  and should also be protected. The Sixth Committee also considered reports of the Secretary-General on the administration of justice at the United Nations  with several delegations praising the achievements made to date by the system  and sharing several recommendations to improve it. Canada’s representative  also speaking for Australia and New Zealand  said that the United Nations’ own practices in administering justice should reflect its values in promoting respect for individual rights and the rule of law.  However  as the number of staff members representing themselves within the system had continued to rise in 2013  the need for a single code of conduct for counsel was amplified. Switzerland’s delegate also subscribed to the idea that there be one code of conduct for counsel of internal and external representatives.  As well  he recommended that the panel that would conduct the interim independent assessment of the system of the administration of justice include legal experts conversant with internal labour dispute mechanisms. The Sixth Committee also concluded consideration of the status of the Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and relating to the protection of victims of armed conflicts. A representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) emphasized that the principal cause of suffering during armed conflict was not a lack of rules  but insufficient respect for those that applied.  The joint initiative with Switzerland aimed to create a new compliance system for international humanitarian law. Also speaking today in the Sixth Committee (Legal) were representatives of Bahrain  Belarus  United States  China  Algeria  El Salvador  Sierra Leone  Finland (speaking for the Nordic countries)  Russian Federation  Cuba  Ethiopia  Israel  Eritrea  India  Turkey  Guatemala  and Tonga  as well as the State of Palestine and the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission. Speaking in exercise of the right of reply were delegates from Israel and Syria. The Sixth Committee (Legal) will next meet at 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday  22 October to commence consideration of criminal accountability of United Nations officials and experts on missions. Background The Sixth Committee met today to conclude its consideration of the reports on the Status of the Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and relating to the protection of victims of armed conflicts and its addendum.  For background  see Press Release GA/L/3483. It also had before it reports on the Consideration of effective measures to enhance the protection  security and safety of diplomatic and consular missions and representatives (document A/69/185) and its addendum (document A/69/185/Add.1). Further to that  it would also take up the administration of justice at the United Nations and consider the Report of the Secretary-General on the matter (document A/69/227)  the Report of the Secretary-General on activities of the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services (document A/69/126) and the Report of the Internal Justice Council (document A/69/205). Statements on Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 Ms. ABDULGHAFFAR (Bahrain) said her country was committed to all international instruments to which it had become a party  such as the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols relating to victims of armed conflict.  Her country had a committee that was charged with all issues related to the implementation of international humanitarian law  including the development of related strategies and policies.  In particular  it exchanged information with all domestic  international and regional Arab entities related to international humanitarian law.  The committee was also charged with strengthening cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and spreading awareness on international humanitarian law.  It participated in developing educational curricula related to humanitarian law in schools  and recommended programs and training courses as well.  The Government was also keen on participating in international events related to the protection of victims in armed conflict.  It had recently participated in the First World Summit to End Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict which had been held in London in June of this year. ILYA ADAMOV (Belarus) said that his country was party to all major treaties on international humanitarian law  a fundamental component to the contribution of its military personnel to peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities.  Work on the third Additional Protocol was being carried out in relation to the country’s implementation of the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention 1954.  Belarus was striving to disseminate international humanitarian law in the military and legal faculties of its higher educational institutions  including through an Olympics event testing knowledge of the law.  Realities of the global situation made international humanitarian law one of the most dynamically developing areas.  Modern technologies would be useful to its further dissemination. STEPHEN TOWNLEY (United States) said that his country’s military operations in armed conflicts complied with international humanitarian law and all other applicable international and domestic laws.  Ratification of Additional Protocol II was pending on the Senate’s Calendar  and an interagency review had indicated that current military practice was compliant with it.  Furthermore  while he expressed concerns about Protocol I  he noted that the guarantees in article 75 for persons in the hands of opposing forces in international armed conflict would be treated as applicable to any individual detained in such a conflict by his country.  It was also important to conduct legal reviews of weapons to determine their consistency with a State’s international obligations  as reflected in article 36 of Additional Protocol I.  Expressing support for the joint Swiss–ICRC initiative on strengthening international humanitarian law  and for the multi-year ICRC project related to legal protections for persons deprived of their liberty in relation to non-international armed conflicts  he emphasized that nations would need to address the conduct of and frequent violations of international humanitarian law by non-State actors.  He also expressed support for the establishment of a Montreux Document forum where issues relating to private security companies could be considered. LI YONGSHENG (China) said that his country had become party to the Additional Protocols to the four Geneva Conventions in 1983  and was one of the first countries to do so.  For over 30 years  his Government had adopted many active and constructive measures to study  disseminate and implement the Additional Protocols.  Domestic legislation had contained explicit stipulations on the obligation to comply with the Additional Protocols.  Education and awareness raising programs on international humanitarian law had been launched in universities.  As well  a National Committee on International Humanitarian Law had been established in 2007 to conduct research and to coordinate related dissemination and implementation.  Noting his country’s participation in the process initiated by the ICRC and the Government of Switzerland to strengthen the mechanisms of compliance with international humanitarian law  he said that such efforts should focus on enhancing the effectiveness of existing mechanisms and proceed from the real needs related to the application of and compliance with international humanitarian law. MOHAMED SALAL EDDINE (Algeria)  associating himself with the African Group  said his country was a State party to all major instruments of international humanitarian law.  In accordance with article 90 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions  his country had declared the competence of the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission.  Its Constitution granted compliance with those international commitments  integrating them into its legal system.  International humanitarian law was disseminated among its armed forces  and was a basic component in its military schools and academies curricula.  The Algerian Red Crescent was also actively involved in the dissemination of international humanitarian law among civil society and the local population.  However  the recent devastating lethal war conducted by Israel  the occupying Power  in the Gaza Strip  still under blockade  constituted a grave violation of international humanitarian law  and he expressed strong support for the State of Palestine’s request for convening a conference of high contracting parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention to examine measures to ensure respect and enforce the Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory  including East Jerusalem. EGRISELDA ARECELY GONZÁLEZ (El Salvador) said that only compliance with international humanitarian law could assist the victims of armed conflict.  She underscored the importance of her country’s Inter-Agency Committee for International Humanitarian Law in complying with the major international treaties on the matter  to which it was a party.  In that regard  the country provided institutional support on international humanitarian law in its national defence in accordance with Additional Protocol I.  There was also a signage campaign to disseminate information on the protection of cultural heritage during time of armed conflict.  She emphasized that international humanitarian law should be complemented with international human rights law. KOUSSAY ABDULJABBAR ALDAHHAK (Syria)  said it was regrettable that despite progress made in international humanitarian law and progress in the accession to conventions  none of that had impeded Israel from committing serious violations of international humanitarian law  as well as other atrocities  such as genocide  crimes of war  and crimes against humanity against the Arab population in the occupied territory  specifically in the occupied Arab Syrian Golan.  The occupying Israeli power had pursued its systematic policy based on deliberate attacks on civilians  the murder of children  women  and older persons  the destruction of infrastructure  and displacement and exile of Arabs from the territory.  The United Nations and the Commission of Inquiry had documented  in hundreds of reports  serious proof of infractions.  Those crimes  committed for decades  had demonstrated that certain countries had accorded immunity to Israel in the area of international humanitarian law.  Israel had also committed indirect violations  which had been committed by proxy  by terrorist fighters  and by mercenaries that certain countries had sent to his country.  International humanitarian law  as well as the United Nations  must now prove their effectiveness and capability of enforcing the Geneva Conventions and its two Additional Protocols  which referred to the protection of victims in armed conflict.  Those countries must be held accountable and not be treated with impunity. REEM JULIA MANSOUR  Observer for the State of Palestine  said the tragedy that befell the Palestinian people this summer in the Gaza Strip had made it clearer than ever before that Israel  the occupying Power  which was responsible for providing protection to the Palestinian people  was violating its legal obligation under the relevant provisions of the Geneva Conventions.  That was evident in the gross number of civilian casualties and injuries that had resulted from the Israeli aggression on Gaza  and the now eight-year illegal and inhumane blockade that had resulted in the collective punishment of an entire civilian population.  Earlier this year  the State of Palestine had acceded to the four Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol I  and thus was now a high contracting party of those international legal instruments.  His Government had requested the Government of Switzerland  in its capacity as the Depository of the Geneva Conventions  to convene a meeting of the high contracting parties to consider measures to enforce the Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory  including East Jerusalem  and to provide protection to the Palestinian people due to the grave breaches of the Convention being committed by Israel.  He urged that such a Conference be convened as soon as possible  appealing to all high contracting parties to support that call. JOY ELYAHOU International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said the principal cause of suffering during armed conflict was not a lack of rules  but insufficient respect for those that applied.  Most of those rules were applicable to international conflict  while the majority of current conflicts were non-international in nature.  The Switzerland-ICRC initiative  aimed at creating a new compliance system for international humanitarian law  would have as its central pillar a regular meeting of States that would serve as an anchor for several compliance functions  including national reporting and thematic discussions on international humanitarian law issues.  A key challenge would be ensuring the system’s effectiveness on the ground  as most States were unwilling to amend the Geneva Conventions or to adopt a new treaty.  Options and recommendations would be proposed in December 2015. The Red Cross was also working to strengthen legal protection for detainees in non-international armed conflict situations  she said.  Four key areas requiring clarification were: conditions of detention; particularly vulnerable groups of detainees; grounds and procedures for internment; and transfers of detainees.  The Committee would prepare a final report presenting options and recommendations by the 2015 International Conference.  She encouraged States to actively participate in the ongoing consultations to strengthen international humanitarian law.  The recent accessions to the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols were welcomed  she said  drawing States’ attention to the ICRC’s International Humanitarian Law National Implementation Database  which contained information on national legislation and case law of 194 countries. HUGO CORUJO  Vice President of the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission  said that his Office was established by article 90 of Additional Protocol 1 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 as an instrument at the disposal of States  to ensure that international humanitarian law was applied during all types of armed conflicts.  The Commission had offered its services in a number of situations  and had carried out delicate negotiations with several parties. However  in order to operate  the Commission needed a specific mandate given by parties to the conflict  he said  adding “To date  that has not been forthcoming.”  It would be helpful to receive comments from States and the relevant United Nations organs as to why they had not yet made use of the services offered by the Commission  and why there appeared to be a preference to appoint ad hoc Commissions  rather than to engage the only established body. Right of Reply In exercise of the right of reply  a representative of Israel said that the attacks upon his country by several delegations were cynical attempts to divert attention from tyrannical regimes.  In response to Syria  he noted that the Government was illegitimate and had killed over 200 000 of its own people.  Similarly  Algeria  whose Government was corrupt  also had no right to criticize. Turning to the comments from the Palestinian representative  he said that much had been said about Israel  without once mentioning Hamas.  Israel never targeted civilians but Hamas  placing its fighters among the civilian population  had  in August  targeted rockets at Israeli citizens every 15 minutes.  Even the Human Rights Committee had said that each rocket launched against Israel was a crime against humanity  while Israel’s military actions had been within the compass of the law. A representative of Syria  in exercise of the right of reply  said the representative of the Israeli occupation was spreading lies.  Many delegations  when they spoke about Israel’s violations of international law  were not speaking in a vacuum  but were speaking of well-documented facts.  The Israeli occupation and its practices had been with the United Nations from its establishment until the present.  The occupying authority had permitted every kind of war crime and crime against humanity over seven decades.  Those vicious actions had affected not only Arabs  but peace activists as well. “Who could forget Rachel Corrie?” he asked  deliberately run down by an Israeli tank.  There were many such actions taking place on a daily basis.  The wounds of victims of latest aggression against the Gaza Strip had not yet healed  and the debris of those attacks were still spread all over Gaza.  The hostilities also practiced by terrorist organizations against the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Golan Heights still echoed through the halls of the Organization.  Israeli occupation always had new crimes to offer.  The occupation itself was the most serious violation of international humanitarian law.  As to Israel’s claims to democracy  he said that was not compatible with racism  the abduction of territory and the displacement of people. EBUN ABEBOLA STRASSER-KING (Sierra Leone) said international humanitarian law was not lacking in jurisprudence.  What was lacking was the commitment of States to abide by their international obligations  and leaders to provide political leadership.  Impunity for serious crimes in armed conflict should not a have a place in modern society.  All States had a moral duty to investigate and prosecute gross violations of international humanitarian law.  Her country would continue to show strong support for the Rome Statute and the International Criminal Court  as well as the activities of the ICRC  the Red Crescent Society and the Sierra Leone International Red Cross Society.  As a post-conflict country  the Government was aware that sexual violence in conflict was one of the greatest and most persistent injustices in the world today.  At the regional level  her country had worked with the African Union and other regional organizations in the implementation of international humanitarian law  and in the enhancement of respect for its rules.  Annual seminars that had been organized by the ICRC and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) had facilitated information-sharing and updating of good practices on international humanitarian law.  At the national level  the formation of a national committee under the ICRC and ECOWAS Plan of Action ensured that her country honoured its international obligations.  That national committee  whose membership was drawn from various stakeholders  advised and assisted the Government in the implementation and promotion of international humanitarian law. Statements on Diplomatic Protection GEORGINA GUILLEN-GRILLO (Costa Rica)  speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  said the dramatic events that had taken place in recent years served as a reminder that the role of representing a State implied a risk to those who performed it.  Member States should redouble their efforts to ensure that the protection and safety of diplomatic and consular representatives  as well as diplomatic and consular missions  was a priority for all.  Recalling that the topic had been included on the agenda in 1980  she said the Committee should not only consider the nature of situations that had been addressed over the last 24 years  but also the new challenges faced in the implementation of those equally important aspects of diplomatic and consular immunities. The impact that State surveillance and/or interception of communications  including extraterritorially  might have on the inviolability of diplomatic and consular archives  documents and communications was of concern  she said.  A transparent and constructive dialogue on that issue would be welcomed.  Noting that States must ensure that their legislation conformed with public international law  she urged all States to take all appropriate measures at the national levels to prevent any acts of violence against diplomatic and consular missions and representatives  as well as against missions and representatives of international governmental organizations and officials of such organizations.  She also urged all States to prevent abuses of diplomatic or consular privileges and immunities  especially those involving the use of violence  and to cooperate with the host State in cases where such abuses had been committed. EGLANTINE CUJO  Delegation of the European Union  urged States to strictly observe  implement and enforce the provisions of international law governed by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  Close cooperation on security matters was needed at the international and national levels  as well as between missions and local authorities.  She condemned the recent attacks on the Indian Consulate in western Afghanistan and the Turkish Consulate in Mosul  as well as the abduction in Yemen of a Iran Embassy staff member  noting that no attack on diplomatic and consular missions or their staff could be justified.  She called on all States to bring the perpetrators to justice. Pointing out that receiving States were required  under the two Vienna Conventions  to take appropriate steps to protect diplomatic missions and consular premises  she said that particular attention must be paid to the threats posed by terrorists and other armed groups  which sometimes forced States to shut down their embassies and consulates  as seen in Libya and Yemen.  She called upon States that had not yet done so to consider becoming parties to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. SARI MAKELA (Finland)  speaking also for Denmark  Iceland  Norway and Sweden  said universally accepted principles and rules of international law  as reflected in the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular relations  placed upon the receiving States a special duty to take all appropriate steps to promote the diplomatic and consular premises and the prevention of any attacks on the diplomatic and consular representatives.  In a situation where the receiving State failed to offer the required protection in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Conventions  the injured State was entitled to claim prompt compensation for loss or injury suffered as a result of such failure. She went on to say that the special duty of the receiving State to protect and to prevent attacks extended also to foreign missions and representatives and international intergovernmental organizations and officials of such organizations.  Effective measures to enhance the protection  security and safety of those missions  representatives and officials were crucial to enable them to fulfil their mandates.  Also needed was close cooperation and information-sharing on security matters  not only at the international level  but also at the national level  between the missions and the competent local authorities  in order to prevent violations of the protection  security and safety of diplomatic and consular missions and representatives. SERGEY A. LEONIDCHENKO (Russian Federation) said it was no coincidence that the most important element of diplomatic and consular law was the special duty of the receiving State to take all appropriate steps to protect the premises of foreign missions against intrusion or damage  or to prevent any disturbance of such missions.  The violence that had occurred against official missions demonstrated that no receiving State was immune from such incidents.  It was unfortunate that a receiving State did not always take appropriate measures to prevent them.  In June of this year  his country’s embassy in Kyiv had suffered attacks  including damage to its building  desecration of its flag and threats to the security of its staff.  That situation was unacceptable.  The inviolability of diplomatic missions and consular representatives was not subject to discussion  as had been recently emphasized by the Yemeni delegation.  In all States where such incidents occurred  decisive measures must be taken to ensure the security of diplomats  as well as foreign diplomatic and consular missions  in accordance with international legal obligations.  As well  comprehensive investigations must be carried out  in order to bring responsible persons to justice. PATRICK LUNA (Brazil)  associating himself with CELAC  said that over the last 24 years  discussions had been limited to the inviolabilities of diplomatic and consular staff and premises without adequate consideration to the protection of archives  documents and communications  which were also covered by international law.  The Vienna Conventions affirmed that such documents were inviolable “wherever they may be”  and further recognized the inviolability of official correspondence.  Such documentation now also existed on digital platforms  and should also be protected in that format.  In that context  he expressed concern at the use of diplomatic and consular missions for surveillance and/or interception of communications in the receiving State  which clearly violated the Vienna Conventions.  The draft resolution on the matter must reflect all those difficulties in ensuring the respect for diplomatic and consular immunities.  The Assembly should recognize those new challenges  and call for full implementation of applicable international law. TANIERIS DIEGUEZ LAO (Cuba)  associating herself with CELAC  said communications and information technology should be used by all States  with the objective of improving capacities  in step with international law.  She expressed concern about and condemned recently revealed practices of using diplomatic and consular locations as surveillance posts  and the interception and/or collection of data on nationally protected individuals  destabilizing countries whose Governments had been legitimately elected by their people.  Those were fragrant violations of the Vienna Convention.  Her country’s legislation had regulated or codified as aggravated crimes all aggressions or attacks on the dignity and honour of foreign diplomatic representatives and other internationally protected individuals.  Also  firm sentencing guidelines for those who committed such acts were in place.  There was a multi-front system for protecting diplomatic corps  and in particular  a security and protection system that ensured the full protection of those individuals on the whole.  The system functioned throughout the country  24 hours a day with translation services.  Diplomatic personnel had numerous quick access phone lines to request any help they needed; that help was provided immediately by a specialized team that had been highly trained.  The system of protection for diplomatic corps had shown a notable drop in criminal acts  and those that had been registered were of low danger levels.  There was a climate of peace and security for the discharge of diplomatic and consular functions in Cuba. YIDNEKACHEW G/MESKEL ZEWDU (Ethiopia) pointed out that host States were duty-bound by the Convention to protect diplomatic premises and persons  and to prevent crimes against them.  Further  host States were obligated to punish or prevent such crimes.  He expressed concern at violent attacks against missions and diplomatic persons  from which his country had also suffered.  The perpetrators of such crimes should be held accountable.  States must prevent illegal activities on their territories  and communicate measures taken to bring the perpetrators to justice.  However  the necessary support was not always provided to the victims of such attacks.  His government was undertaking the responsibility to protect those missions in his country  and believed that the same protections should be provided to his country’s premises and persons. MEITAR NIR-TAL (Israel) noted that her country’s diplomats and premises had long been subject to terrorist attacks and failed plots throughout the world.  The international community should cooperate closely in all spheres  particularly on the operational legal and intelligence sharing levels  and take all necessary measures to provide adequate protection for all diplomatic and consular missions and representatives  as required by the two Vienna Conventions.  She urged Member States and the international community as a whole to cooperate closely to ensure a safe international environment  which would allow diplomatic and consular missions and representatives to carry out their essential duties free from fear and harm. ELSA HAILE (Eritrea) said diplomatic and consular officials were discharging their responsibilities in a more complex environment.  Access and transparency and use of communications technology could largely describe the essence of modern diplomacy.  Despite the increased vulnerability of diplomatic missions and consular personnel  it was the responsibility of the host country to protect the inviolability  safety and security of diplomats and missions.  Today  diplomats and diplomatic missions relied more on more on electronic technology.  However  the secret and illegal collection of electronic data was a violation of the Vienna Convention and international principles.  It was unacceptable behaviour and must be stopped. STEPHEN TOWNLEY (United States)  tracing the history of diplomatic protections to ancient times  pointed out that States had also always had the duty to protect diplomats from harmful acts by non-State actors.  Such attacks had increased in numbers  and more often involved non-State armed groups.  There had been 200 such attacks against his country’s diplomatic facilities and personnel in the last ten years  resulting in the deaths of 40 personnel.  Nor was the United States alone in that regard.  The Convention on Internationally Protected Persons  adopted by the General Assembly in 1973  which had 176 United Nations States parties  required the punishment of violent attacks against foreign Government officials and the prevention of the commission of such crimes.  As the facts and circumstances of attacks on diplomatic and consular personnel were changing  so must preventive measures.  Among such measures  he stressed the need for collaboration with local authorities. M. KOTESWARA RAO (India)  condemning all acts of violence against the security and safety of diplomatic and consular missions and representatives  said it was a serious concern that needed to be addressed effectively.  He enumerated international instruments on the matter  to all of which his country was party  and stressed the need for those States that had not yet done so to become party to them.  He also took note of the comments made by the Brazilian delegation  and expressed his support for them. PAN KUN (China) condemned recent incidents against diplomatic premises  and asked that States adopt more effective measures to enhance the protection of diplomatic personnel.  As stated in the Vienna Convention  receiving States would be obligated to take all appropriate preventive measures.  However  with “serious security concerns”  consideration could be given to allow sending States to dispatch security personnel to protect its own diplomatic corps.  States should also continually improve measures to pursue and punish the perpetrators following an incident  and should adopt measures to investigate the acts.  The receiving State should also be held accountable for failing to fulfil its obligations under the Convention. ĪPEK ZEYTINOĞLU ÖZKAN (Turkey)  associating herself with the European Union  condemned all attacks perpetrated against diplomatic and consular missions and representatives worldwide  and underlined that her country took all measures to effectively protect missions and diplomats stationed on its territory.  Cooperation between States and the fight against terrorism were crucial.  Noting that Turkish diplomatic and consular officers had been subjected to attack over the last two years  she expressed gratitude to the delegation of the European Union for its condemnation of the attack against its consulate in Mosul in June of this year. MOHAMED SALAH EDDINE BELAID (Algeria) condemned the attacks against the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA)  and conveyed his country’s “deepest and sincere condolences” to the families of fallen peacekeepers and their Governments.  He also strongly condemned all and any acts of violence against diplomatic and consular missions and representatives.  The receiving State was under special duty to protect diplomatic personnel and entities against intrusion or damage  and to prevent disturbances.  Algeria was committed to its obligations under international law and the Vienna Conventions to provide appropriate protections and security.  He advocated for a close cooperation on practical and preventive measures to enhance protection  security and safety of diplomatic and consular missions and representatives  and the prompt and timely exchange of information regarding the violations. EGRISELDA ARECELY GONZÁLEZ (El Salvador) noting that her country had been party to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations since 1965  drew attention to article 25 of that document  which required host States to take all measures to protect the safety of all diplomatic premises and persons.  Therefore  any violence committed against diplomatic facilities or personnel was clearly illegal.  Measures were needed to prevent such acts.  Pointing out that El Salvador had internal domestic mechanisms allowing for the protection of diplomatic premises and personnel  she called for ongoing consideration of the topic in the Committee  as its principles were essential to governing relationships between States. KOUSSAY ABDULJABBAR ALDAHHAK (Syria) said successful diplomacy required the provision of an appropriate environment  and conditions of peace and safety  to enable diplomats to carry out their functions.  He condemned attacks against diplomatic and consular missions  which  regardless of their motives  were criminal acts  and could not be justified under any circumstances.  Perpetrators must be held accountable and must be punished.  Syrian diplomatic and consular missions in various capitals throughout the world  and diplomats working therein  had suffered over the past four years and had continued to suffer to this day.  Serious aggressions and gross intrusions in the form of invasions  sabotage  destruction and looting  and physical attacks  had affected negatively the safety of those missions and their personnel and their ability to carry out their functions.  While the Governments of some States had dealt positively with that phenomenon and had respected their obligations under international law  the responsibility of other States had not risen to the “required level”.  His Government  which exerted all efforts to guarantee the safety of accredited diplomatic missions in Syria  reaffirmed the need for all States to respect their obligations arising from the Vienna Conventions  among others. Statements on Administration of Justice GILES NORMAN (Canada)  speaking also for Australia and New Zealand  said the United Nations’ own practices in administering justice should reflect its values in promoting respect for individual rights and the rule of law.  It should continue to be independent  transparent and professional.  He welcomed General Assembly resolution 68/24  which recognized the need to ensure that all individuals acting as legal representatives  whether staff members representing other staff members or themselves  or external counsel representing staff members  were subject to the same standards of professional conduct in the United Nations system.  As the number of self-represented staff members had continued to rise in 2013  the need for a single code of conduct was amplified. Expressing support for the principle that all parties in a dispute should be equal  he recommended that the Secretary-General consider the feasibility of extending the proposed code of conduct to cover all counsel  rather than limiting it to external representatives.  Acknowledging the role of the Office of Staff Legal Assistance in the internal justice system  he said an effective and efficient way for staff to contribute to funding the Office was needed.  Thus  he welcomed the introduction in April of this year of an automatic payroll deduction with an opt-out provision.  He also encouraged efforts to enable settlement of disputes through informal means  which could avoid unnecessary litigation and its associated costs and resources. GEORGINA GUILLEN-GRILLO (Costa Rica)  speaking for CELAC  stressed that the Community would continue to support all measures enabling the Organization to become a better employer.  Recalling the important role of the Committee in making the administration of justice fully operational  she said that the proposal to conduct independent interim evaluation on all aspects of the justice system was of great importance.  The plan addressing the mechanism for additional voluntary funding for staff legal assistance should be complementary  and take into account the views of stakeholders.  Noting the substantive volume of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal and Appeals Tribunal’s work  she said CELAC was ready to explore new ways to improve their working methods. On the work of the Office of United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services  she emphasized that the informal resolution of conflict was a crucial element in the administration of justice.  Incentives must be implemented to encourage more recourse to informal resolution.  That office should not only reflect the responsibility for oversight  but also continue with necessary support to reinforce due process within the Organization  and ensure transparency and accountability by holding managers responsible for their actions.  The Sixth Committee must continue to coordinate and cooperate closely with the Fifth Committee  to ensure an appropriate division of labour and avoid an overlapping or encroachment of mandates. GILLES MARHIC  Delegation of the European Union  said that the processing of cases through all phases of both the formal and informal systems of justice at the United Nations had improved markedly  although some challenges remained.  In light of the revised proposal for an assessment of the system  2015 would be important.  The view of the Internal Justice Council and the independent review panel in charge of the system’s assessment would be well-placed to consider the issues at stake  and recommend to the General Assembly whether changes to the statutes of the Tribunals were needed.  He expressed support for efforts by the Office of the Ombudsman and Mediation Services to advance and encourage use of the informal conflict resolution  and praised the Management Evaluation Unit’s systematic efforts to identify requests  with the potential for settlement through the informal system. Pointing out that the number of new cases in the Dispute Tribunal seemed to be stabilizing and that progress was being made in disposing of them effectively  he expressed concern  however  at the number of decisions and judgments that were being appealed to the Appeals Tribunal with markedly different success rates.  As well  the Tribunals had not yet amended their rules of procedure to provide that judgements imposing financial obligations on the Organization were not executable until the deadline for appeal had expired  or the appeal had been concluded.  The interim assessment could also evaluate the impact of case law on the work of the Organization’s managers.  Consideration should also be given to the scope of the code of conduct  which could also apply to in-house counsel.  Caution should be taken towards proposals to amend the Statute.  All possible systemic consequences should be explored.  On the issue of legal protection of non-staff personnel  he favoured a differentiated system that provided an adequate  effective and appropriate remedy. ANA CRISTINA RODRIGUEZ PINEDA (Guatemala)  associating herself with CELAC  said that while achievements had been significant  a lot remained to be done to achieve a system that met the expectations of all sides.  The informal system of dispute settlement should be used as much as possible to avoid unnecessary judicial proceedings.  She commended the Ombudsman and Mediation Services for their efforts in encouraging staff to use the informal system.  The interaction between the formal and informal systems should continue to be examined  given the low number of cases submitted by the Tribunals to the Office of the Ombudsman.  The Secretariat should continue to disseminate information on the system  so that staff could be informed of its benefits.  The recently launched modern and updated search engine would facilitate access to the Tribunal’s jurisprudence.  Regarding the request to extend to the end of 2015 the posts of three ad litem judges and their support staff  given the volume of their work  permanent judges must be considered  rather than having part-time or ad litem judges.  In regards to the Committee’s substantive contributions on legal aspects in the administration of justice  she had identified the draft amendment of article 3 on the Statutes of the Appeals Tribunal and the prerogatives and immunities of judges  among others  as possible topics for the current session. MAXIM V. MUSIKHIN (Russian Federation) expressed satisfaction with the number of cases handled by the Office of the Ombudsman and Mediation Services  which demonstrated their effectiveness.  It was difficult to overestimate the usefulness of pre-trial methods to resolve conflicts  which helped to avoid litigation.  In most cases  the parties could come to an agreement.  In that context  he said the Office of the Ombudsman should step up its efforts to inform staff of the non-judicial means available for the resolution of conflicts. DAMARIS CARNAL (Switzerland) made recommendations for elements to be included in the letter of the Sixth Committee (Legal) to the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) on the administration of justice at the United Nations.  It was important to ensure the independence of the Dispute and Appeals Tribunals.  An adequate solution must be found for non-staff personnel  regardless of the type of contract they had concluded with the Organization.  He welcomed the revised proposal for conducting an interim independent assessment of the system of administration of justice.  However  the proposal did not set out the qualifications for the panel members who would conduct that assessment.  He recommended that it include legal experts conversant with internal labour dispute mechanisms.  He further expressed support for the proposal to amend the Statutes of the Dispute and Appeals Tribunals  with a view to clearly specifying the privileges and immunities enjoyed by the judges of both.  Finally  on the proposed code of conduct for external representatives  he subscribed to the Internal Justice Council’s view that there should be one code of conduct for internal and external representatives. T. SUKA MANGISI (Tonga) emphasized the importance of judicial independence in the administration of justice at the United Nations  to which all staff members should have access.  He expressed support for the proposed code of professional  conduct for external legal representatives contained in the Secretary-General’s report.  Recognizing the importance of addressing the accountability of individuals whose violations had led to financial loss  he also expressed support for the mechanism for addressing potential complaints under the code of conduct for the judges in the United Nations Dispute and Appeals Tribunals.  Regarding the under-resourcing of the Office of Staff Legal Assistance  and the voluntary funding mechanism which he was in support of  he said that he was waiting for the final report on the system’s implementation.  The Secretary-General’s revised proposal for an independent assessment of the system for administrative justice was welcomed  as well as an upgraded  streamlined search engine to access jurisprudence and past cases. STEPHEN TOWNLEY (United States) expressed concern at the Dispute Tribunal’s practice in recent years of ordering suspensions of action after completion of the management evaluation in cases where such suspensions were not authorized by article 10 of its Statute.  There was also concern that the Tribunals might be awarding moral damages in some cases where it appeared the claimant had not suffered harm.  He pointed out that the Appeals Tribunal’s recent decision stated that the Dispute Tribunal had “`acted unlawfully’” by ordering suspension of action in a case involving non-renewal of appointment.  He voiced hope that that decision would put the matter to rest.  He also voiced concern that for damages to be moral  as opposed to exemplary  there must be a finding of harm.  However  the jurisprudence of the Tribunals did not draw that clear line.  On other matters  he supported the amendment to the Statute of the Appeals Tribunal relating to qualifications of judges  saying that such an amendment might be considered for the Dispute Tribunal as well.  He also sought clarification on what the proposed code of professional conduct for external legal representatives was meant to address  and expressed support for the protection of whistleblowers. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-21,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaef3403.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Preparations for the Third Conference on Financing for Development had proceeded in a “positive spirit”  the representative of Ethiopia today told delegates in the Second Committee (Economic and Financial) during discussions on Financing for Development and the international financial system and development. “A successful and ambitious outcome” for the Conference  which would take place in Addis Ababa  was possible  he said  pointing to consensus among States on the need to build on Monterrey and Doha the critical role of official development assistance (ODA) in implementing the post-2015 agenda. “Addis needs to make a difference on the ground ” said the representative of Norway who agreed that ODA was “crucial”  particularly for least developed countries  and urged respect and re-confirmation of existing commitments. Other flows  such as foreign direct investments and remittances  were far more important than ODA  he added  stressing the need to use resources efficiently  to encourage private sector job creation  and to curb illicit financial flows.  The latter should be placed at the top of the new development agenda as a key element in the discussion on domestic resource mobilization. For India’s representative  the Conference should go beyond a discussion of financing for development and should aim to create a “global system conducive to development itself” with the goal of enabling faster  inclusive economic growth in developing countries to allow them to generate necessary resources domestically. The Conference should also aim to update the Monterrey Consensus and Doha Declaration  urged the representative of Brazil  so that the new development agenda and sustainable development goals could be financed.  The Conference needed to provide clear guidance on means of implementation  and decide on follow-up  including providing adequate permanent structures and an accountability framework. That view was repeated throughout the debate  with Indonesia’s delegate  speaking on behalf of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  also stressing the need for a strong means of implementation in financing  technology transfer  capacity-building and trade.  He welcomed the proposal of the Open Working Group on the Sustainable Development Goals to include a standalone goal on means of implementation. The representative of the United States noted the growing complexity of development financing  with the growth of private flows reflecting changes in developing countries’ markets and increased access to information about those markets.  Private flows would be highest when businesses expected returns  so it was important to ensure an enabling domestic environment. Trade was also vital to growth  she added  calling on States “not to turn inward” but to “integrate further”.  That call for liberalization was echoed by St Lucia’s representative  who spoke for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).  She called for changes to an international trading system that worked to “harm the world’s poorest” and the removal of agricultural subsidies that “rob poor countries of markets for their products”. Least developed countries were particularly badly hit by trade imbalances  said the delegate of Benin  on behalf of the Group representing those countries.  He stressed the need to consider full debt cancellation and to improve the framework for encouraging foreign direct investment. Least developed countries attracted less than 1.7 per cent of total foreign investment  he said  adding that most was focused on natural resources extraction and related industries.  An “international investment support centre for least developed countries under the auspices of the United Nations” should be considered to help boost investment flows. Zimbabwe’s representative called for amplification of the voice of the General Assembly on matters of global economic governance and reform of global economic governance structures to fix a “democratic deficit” that “severely undermines their credibility and legitimacy”.  Better resources were needed and developing countries needed greater voting powers. The reports before the Committee were introduced by Alexander Trepelkov of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Also speaking today were representatives of Bolivia (on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China)  Costa Rica (on behalf of the Economic Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC))  Malawi (on behalf of the African Group)  Egypt (on behalf of the Arab Group)  Peru  Belarus  Japan  Sudan  Venezuela  Trinidad and Tobago  Switzerland  Senegal  China  Nepal  Russian Federation  Thailand  Singapore  Mexico  Morocco  Australia  United Republic of Tanzania  Bangladesh  Algeria  Congo  New Zealand  Iran  and the Solomon Islands. A representative of the delegation of the European Union also spoke. The Committee will meet again on 22 October  at 10 a.m.  to consider international trade and development. Background The Second Committee (Economic and Financial) met this morning to discuss macroeconomic policy questions (the international financial system and development) and financing for development.  The Committee had before it several reports related to the two agenda items. Introduction of Reports ALEXANDER TREPELKOV  Director of the Financing for Development Office of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs  introduced two reports.  The Secretary-General’s report on the follow-up to and implementation of the Monterrey Consensus and Doha Declaration on Financing for Development (document A/69/358) dealt with mobilizing domestic financial resources for development; mobilizing international private resources for development; international trade as an engine for development; international financial and technical cooperation for development; external debt; and systemic issues — enhancing the coherence and consistency of the international monetary  financial and trading systems in support of development. He also introduced the report of the Secretary-General on the international financial system and development (document A/69/188)  which contained information on trends in international official and private capital flows to developing countries and efforts to strengthen the international financial system towards the post-2015 development agenda.  Ongoing challenges in the areas of financial regulation  sovereign debt distress  the global financial safety net  multilateral surveillance  policy coordination and governance reform of the international financial institutions were reviewed.  Overall  it stressed that the international financial system would be critical to implementation of the post-2015 agenda. Statements PAMELA GRACE LUNA TUDELA (Bolivia)  speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China  said the question of financing had a central role in the implementation of the internationally agreed development goals  including the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda.  In that regard  it was imperative to ensure adequate and stable means of implementation to achieve those goals and to support the implementation of the post-2015 agenda.  ODA remained essential as an instrument for development and to help the achievement of national development objectives  she said  adding that it was necessary for developed States to fulfil in good faith their commitments to developing and least developed countries. The upcoming Conference on Financing for Development must also discuss the 2008-2009 economic financial crisis and its consequences  including its impact on the implementation of the internationally agreed development goals. The preparatory process of the Conference must also address financing for sustainable development through a coherent approach that integrated its three dimensions and inter-linkages.  Further  it must articulate a forward-looking focus on financing the new set of sustainable development goals.  The Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration provided the conceptual framework for the Conference.  A strong preparatory process leading to the Addis Ababa Conference was needed with participation from capitals in order to achieve an ambitious outcome document. MENISSA RAMBALLY (Saint Lucia) spoke on behalf of CARICOM  and associated herself with the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC).  She said that challenges faced by financing for development required a global commitment to achieve internationally agreed development goals  to create conditions that would enable more foreign investment  debt relief and efficient Government  and to tear down the trade barriers that “harm the world’s poorest” and the agricultural subsidies that “rob poor countries of markets for their products”. Building on Monterrey and Doha  she said  the third International Conference on Financing for Development must include due consideration to the strengthening of international cooperation in tax matters  financing of sustainable development goals  and the reform of global institutions.  Attention must also be given to the questions of debt  including the matter of sovereign debt restructuring.  The practice of using per capita gross domestic product (GDP) as a measure of national wealth and resilience presented a “persistent obstacle to any form of development assistance or relief” for CARICOM member States  and resulted in a misleading classification of many of them as middle- or high-income countries. WILLIAM JOSÉ CALVO CALVO (Costa Rica)  speaking on behalf of CELAC  said that despite noticeable progress in some developing regions  the world gross product was forecast to grow modestly  and unemployment remained dangerously high in several countries.  More forceful and concerted policy actions at the national and international levels were needed to mitigate major risks and ensure stronger and sustained economic recovery.  Policies pursuing long-term sustainable growth  employment and lowering income inequality were the best way to achieve poverty eradication.  It was also critical to enhance transparency  supervision  regulation and good governance of the international financial system to assure international stability. He welcomed General Assembly resolution 68/304 as the first step to improving the international architecture for sovereign debt restructuring.  Concerning trade  he noted that to harness its potential  there had to be a universal  rule-based  open  non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system that promoted recovery  growth  sustainable development and employment  taking into account the needs and interests of developing countries.  The distortions on international trade should be addressed  in particular non-tariff measures  the persistence of tariff peaks  agricultural export subsidies and trade distorting domestic support.  On financing for development  he said that an effective strategy would require the mobilization and use of new and additional financial resources  and underscored the central role of ODA in achieving development goals. OTTO RIADI (Indonesia)  speaking on behalf of ASEAN and associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said the post-2015 agenda needed to be supported by a strong means of implementation in financing  technology transfer  capacity-building and trade.  He welcomed the proposal of the Open Working Group to include a standalone goal on means of implementation  and targets on means of implementation connected to each other goal.  He looked forward to the Financing for Development conference  hoping it would deliver new reaffirmation of commitments on ODA  mobilize international and domestic financing sources  and strengthen cooperation between developed and developing countries on development financing  financial policy coordination and reform of the international financial architecture. Regional cooperation was important to global strategies for financing for development  he said.  As the ASEAN economic community progressed  new and improved methods were promoting trade facilitation  capital market development  food security  intellectual property and infrastructure development.  Several regional projects aimed at strengthening national capacities to formulate  implement and monitor development strategies  like the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) project to support countries in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  Peace  stability and development was at the top of the ASEAN agenda and the aim was to sustain existing momentum while encouraging connectivity for trade and investment that enhanced private sector integration and competitiveness among Member States. CHARLES P. MSOSA (Malawi)  speaking on behalf of the African Group  and associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  underlined that international development cooperation should remain at the heart of the new global development framework process.  The implementation of the post-2015 agenda would depend on a global partnership for sustainable development and the eradication of poverty.  The success of the Millennium Development Goals and the global development agenda beyond 2015 would depend on the accomplishment of the global commitment on financing for development. He said that as ODA declined for Africa  urgent measures were needed to enable the continent to sustain development gains and adapt to new economic  social and environmental challenges.  The African Group anticipated that the outcome of the Conference on Sustainable Development Financing would have concrete recommendations that could be put into immediate effect.  The Conference could make a difference if its outcome placed poverty eradication as a core development agenda and provided the financial framework to back the transformative development agenda beyond 2015.  The international community should support the efforts of many African countries to develop their capacities of collecting public revenues as to finance their development.  Members States and other donors should also consider contributing to the Trust Fund for the Follow up to the international Conference on Financing for Development. OSAMA ABDELKHALEK MAHMOUD (Egypt)  speaking on behalf of the Arab Group  and associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  supported a more prosperous and just future for all countries  in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.  He stressed the need for good preparations for the upcoming Conference on Financing for Development to address the issues facing the world.  There must be an environment conducive to sustainable development  taking into account the needs of developing countries  particularly their access to markets.  He also called for the restructuring of the international system to involve developing countries in all decision-making processes. ANTONIO DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and CELAC  said the Monterrey Consensus and Doha Declaration must be updated and adjusted to enable the framework for financing sustainable development goals.  The upcoming Conference on Financing for Development was expected to provide clear guidance for the means of implementation  and should decide on the follow-up mechanisms  including adequate permanent structures and an accountability framework.  Many countries  including his  had prioritized people-centred policies for poverty eradication and sustainable growth.  An agreement must be reached on a global economic and financial architecture that respected domestic policy choices and the central role of Governments.  In view of falling levels of ODA  which “tended to be overestimated”  he called on development partners to meet their commitments and to consider an across-the-board increase in that assistance. GEIR O. PEDERSEN (Norway) said “Addis needs to make a difference on the ground”  and that future sustainable development goals could only be achieved by tapping into all available sources and using them efficiently.  Private incentives and public goals must be better aligned  and the major push for poverty reduction would come from private sector-led job creation.  As ODA was crucial for many countries  particularly those least developed and fragile States  the existing commitments should be respected and re-confirmed.  However  other flows  such as foreign direct investments and remittances  were far more important than ODA.  In particular  there was a vast potential in curbing illicit financial flows  which should be placed at the top of the development agenda as a key element in the discussion on domestic resource mobilization. GLAUCO SEOANE (Peru) aligned himself with the Group of 77 and China and CELCAC  saying it was a “moral imperative” to eradicate poverty worldwide.  The Conference on Financing for Development would be crucial to the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda.  To address the three dimensions of sustainable development  new and more comprehensive means for development were needed and he listed several directions in which international efforts should go in order to boost growth and help eradicate poverty  with a strengthened global partnership for development as a key element.  If the sustainable development goals failed  he predicted infinitely greater costs for humanity to develop in harmony with nature. TERRI ROBL (United States) said her country was working to achieve the goal of eradicating extreme poverty in the next two decades.  Development financing had become increasingly complex  with the growth in private financing for development reflecting changes in developing countries’ markets and the increased availability to potential investors of information about those markets.  Private flows were at their highest when businesses expected returns  so it was important to encourage that.  She stressed the growing importance of South-South cooperation.  Noting the approach of the Conference on Development Financing  she hoped that several resolutions that the Committee would discuss would remain procedural to ensure focus on preparations for the Conference.  She underlined the importance of infrastructure investments and trade to boosting growth and called for continued liberalization.  The answer was “not to turn inward” but to “integrate further”. IGOR MISHKORUDNY (Belarus) looked forward to the Conference on Financing for Development  and stressed the need for the development agenda to include a greater role for developing States  including through the expansion of the world’s reserve currencies.  He pointed in particular to special drawing rights.  Working alongside the Bretton Woods institutions  Belarus had prepared laws on financial market regulation  with a World Bank partnership aimed at modernizing financial governance  taking into account best practices.  The private sector was also developing  with forestry management and transport infrastructure receiving $300 million in investments.  The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) aided growth and he called for greater cooperation between members and other participants.  The markets of middle-income countries drove growth and technological innovation and he rejected all unilateral coercive economic and trade measures. MICHIKO MIYANO (Japan) said that for successful implementation of the post-2015 agenda  all macroeconomic tools must be mobilized in an integrated manner.  She outlined several priorities in preparation for the Conference on Financing for Development.  Namely  the discussion should build on the Monterrey Consensus and Doha Declaration  capture the full spectrum of capital flows  including the illicit ones  and address the evolving development cooperation.  As domestic public financing was fundamental for development financing  capacity-building in the areas of tax  customs  statistics and others was instrumental in ensuring sustainability.  Her country had promoted people-centred investment  meaning that all public and private investments should be conducive to sustainable development and enhance people’s resilience to economic crises  disasters and climate change. RWAYDA IZZELDIN HAMID ELHASSAN (Sudan)  associating herself with the African Group  Group of 77 and China  and the Arab Group  said the world was facing a global challenge regarding financing for development in countries in special situations.  ODA for developing countries had decreased in the past two years  and it was not enough to meet development challenges  especially in countries in special situations.  She was concerned about developed countries’ unmet commitments  and appealed to them to allocate the necessary resources to sustainable development agendas  in accordance with national priorities and needs.  Moreover  she insisted on having sufficient financing for all executive activities implemented by the United Nations system. AMIT NARANG (India)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that 2015 was the perfect opportunity “to ensure a global financial system that is pro-development”.  For the post-2015 agenda to be realized  the international financial system must ensure a substantial augmentation of net financial flows to developing countries  as well as incentivize long-term investments in sustainable development by balancing the imperatives of “stability” with those of “access”.  The upcoming Conference on Financing for Development must go beyond the question of development finance and aim at creating a “global system conducive to development itself”.  The ultimate goal should be to enable faster inclusive economic growth in developing countries to allow them to generate the resources they needed themselves. JEAN-FRANCIS ZINSSOU (Benin) spoke on behalf of the Group of Least Developed Countries and aligned himself with the Group of 77 and China.  He said that least developed countries needed additional  preferential  concessional and most favourable treatment to improve access to markets  finance  technologies  know-how and other resources  along with differential and flexible treatment as they undertook international commitments and obligations.  Domestic resources needed mobilizing but substantial limits on the growth of tax revenues hampered that.  ODA remained a “critical source of external financing” but international aid plans indicated a focus on middle-income countries.  Debt  especially debt-servicing  aggravated the poverty trap  with servicing crowding out much needed public expenditure in budgets.  Full debt cancellation should be considered at the Conference on Financing for Development. Least developed countries attracted less than 1.7 per cent of total foreign direct investment  he said  adding that most was focused on natural resources extraction and related industries.  Infrastructure  regulatory frameworks  and human and institutional capacities were needed to boost investment flows.  An “international investment support centre for least developed countries under the auspices of the United Nations” should be considered as part of the financing conference  the post-2015 agenda and the mid-term review of Istanbul Programme of Action.  Remittances  South-South cooperation and aid for trade were essential elements of development but a deceleration in the expansion of trade for least developed countries had occurred.  The 1.11 per cent of global exports for which they accounted was well below the 2020 target of 2 per cent and the Bali Package needed urgent implementation.  The voices of least developed countries needed amplifying in international financial and economic decision-making and they should be recognized as a special category by the Bretton Woods institutions. HENRY ALFREDO SUÁREZ MORENO (Venezuela) said no single model on development financing could be applied to all countries and that the approach had to be adapted based on the needs and specific circumstances of each State and on the basis of their chosen policies.  Approaches also had to account for debt  trade  and technology transfer issues.  Donor countries had to honour commitments made on ODA to ensure they provided necessary resources to promote development.  The main responsibility lay with States  including responsibility for financing.  The international financial architecture needed reform to ensure they contributed better to democratic decision-making and the greater participation of developing countries.  Financing was vital to the fulfilment of goals set beyond 2015  and he said he had taken part in the intergovernmental panel to find mechanisms effective for implementation of the post-2015 agenda.  The consensus document that emerged from discussions would be a useful input for the financing conference. FREDERICK MUSIIWA MAKAMURE SHAVA (Zimbabwe) aligned with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  saying ill-discipline and lack of coordination in global economic policy often led to macroeconomic imbalances that caused dire consequences for the stability of the international system.  The Assembly’s voice needed amplifying on matters of global economic governance  while the global financial system needed reform.  Global economic governance also needed reform to fix a “democratic deficit” that “severely undermines their credibility and legitimacy”.  Better resources were needed and developing countries needed greater voting powers.  Landlocked developing countries were “persistently marginalized” in trade because of their “geographical handicap” and measures were needed to improve their participation.  The Doha Round should be concluded and the Bali Package implemented  particularly in light of the low share of world trade held by landlocked developing countries due to dependence on primary commodities.  For the needed structural transformation  technical and financial assistance was needed.  Zimbabwe had a policy aiming at developing processing capacities of commodities. MELISSA ANN MARIE BOISSIERE (Trinidad and Tobago)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  CELAC and CARICOM  said the imperative of assisting small States with building resilience to external shocks required that their vulnerabilities be taken into account in the design of rules and practices in the international financial system.  She called for a reform of the international financial system and institutions so that they would be more inclusive  transparent and participatory.  Further international assistance was needed to assist small vulnerable developing countries with building resilience to economic and financial shocks  especially with the evaluation and implementation of various instruments aimed at managing sovereign debt.  In that context  her country fully supported the recent resolution on the establishment of a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes. AMAN HASSEN (Ethiopia) associated himself with the Group of 77 and China  Group of least developed countries  and the African Group.  He recalled the preparatory process for the Conference on Financing for Development  believing the “positive spirit” of negotiations boded well for “a successful and ambitious outcome”.  There was consensus on the need to build on Monterrey and Doha  to involve technical experts in the preparatory process  and the critical role of ODA in implementing the post-2015 agenda.  The Conference would also review implementation of previous outcomes and map out a strengthened framework for future work.  To mobilize significant domestic resources for development  countries needed capacity  and that required international support. OLIVIER MARC ZEHNDER (Switzerland) reiterated the need for a single agenda to eradicate poverty and promote sustainable development  which should include a monitoring and accountability framework  and a means of implementation.  If the international community was serious about financing the new agenda  an integrated and coherent framework for aid  climate finance and sustainable development was needed  as the different flows were not substitutes for one another.  The path from the large number of policy recommendations presented by the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts towards a coherent framework was long.  “We must strike the right balance between short-term needs and aligning incentives for long-term financing” to ensure the sustainable development agenda could become a reality  he said. IBRAHIMA SORY SYLLA (Senegal)  associating himself with Group of 77 and China  African Group  and the Group of Least Developed Countries  said the current state of the global economy was negatively impacting the performance of developing countries and the stability of their macroeconomic frameworks.  While the Monterrey Consensus had laid a major groundwork for mobilizing resources  its implementation had not enabled their countries to properly address economic imbalances.  He hoped the upcoming conference in Ethiopia would provide an opportunity to adopt new and more coherent financial strategies  founded on national ownership. On ODA  the international community should uphold its commitments and adopt measures to guarantee more predictability of aid flows to ensure their effectiveness.  He called for the establishment of an international tax on financial transactions  except on remittances  and for a reform of the global economic and financial governance to give more flexibility to the conditions for access to credit. YINGZHU CHEN (China)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  said the international community must ensure more balanced macroeconomic policies  and countries must take reform and innovation as core components of their growth patterns.  It was important to continue to object to trade and investment protectionism  and to create a transparent and stable investment environment.  She called for a reform of the current international financial system and global economic governance to increase the representation and bargaining power of developing countries.  The global financial regulation and international monetary system should also be improved.  Her country’s economy had grown by 7.4 per cent in the first half of 2014  and economic restructuring continued to move ahead. JOHN BUSUTTIL (European Union) said his engagement at the United Nations and the Committee would be guided by the objective of reaching consensus on a single  short  inspiring and relevant post-2015 development framework that was universal  comprehensive and transformative and ensured a rights-based approach encompassing human rights.  The proposal agreed in the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals should be the basis for integrating those goals into the post-2015 agenda.  The report of the Committee of Experts on Sustainable Financing would guide the intergovernmental process which would lead to the Addis Ababa Conference.  It was important to ensure that goals and targets had universal significance.  If the post-2015 agenda were to be truly transformational  it was vital that all Governments played their part and were sufficiently ambitious in their levels of aspiration.  Further deliberation was needed on how to ensure the necessary global transformation  while taking into account national circumstances. He said that climate change would continue be an important topic and a central challenge for sustainable development  with the potential to undermine poverty eradication efforts.  The Union stood ready to contribute to the elaboration of a new global partnership which encompassed all available means of implementation.  That partnership should mobilize action at all levels by all countries and other stakeholders  based on an enabling policy framework.  The Union remained committed to the Doha Development Agenda and the implementation of the Bali ministerial decision.  The Financing for Development Conference in July 2015 would provide an opportunity for a global discussion on the range of means of implementation for the post-2015 agenda  thereby making a positive contribution to the September 2015 summit.  Preparations for the two events should support one another and avoid a duplication of effort. SEWA LAMSAL ADHIKARI (Nepal) associated herself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Group of Least Developed Countries.  She said that resource constraints constituted one of the biggest challenges facing the least developed countries in achieving sustained  inclusive and equitable growth  and sustainable development.  Structural weaknesses such as low levels of per capita income  savings and investment  and a small tax base constrained their efforts to mobilize domestic resources.  As those countries had only 1.14 per cent share of world trade  the international trade and finance architecture should be supportive of and responsive to their special needs and priorities.  The volume of foreign direct investment flows to the least developed countries remained low with less than 2 per cent  and mostly concentrated in extractive sectors.  Accordingly  development partners should encourage their companies to diversify their investment in the productive sectors of such countries. DILYARA S. RAVILOVA-BOROVIK (Russian Federation) said that unless shortcomings in the international financial system were appropriately addressed  the implementation of the post-2015 agenda would not be safeguarded from a stalemate.  Finding successful solutions could be helped by expanding the representation of developing countries and fast growing economies in international institutions.  ODA should remain the main source of financing to achieve the sustainable development goals.  At the same time  alternative and innovative sources played an important role as additional mechanisms for mobilizing development resources.  She called for private incentives for development to be harmonized with State goals  and expressed support for the principle of ownership and leadership of countries in implementing international development strategies. PATTAMAWADEE AUEAREECHIT (Thailand)  aligning with the Group of 77 and China and ASEAN  said that despite progress in regulatory reforms after the 2008 global economic and financial crises  stability had not be restored for progress towards the post-2015 development agenda.  Thailand  which was inspired by its King’s Sufficiency Economy Philosophy  supported strengthening the role of the United Nations in enhancing engagement with regional and international financial institutions.  Emphasizing the importance of regional economic integration as a path towards collective  inclusive and sustainable development  Thailand and other ASEAN countries were working to ensure a smooth transition to the ASEAN Community in 2015.  Reforming the international financial architecture and enhancing equitable representation as well as increasing the voting rights of developing countries in the Bretton Woods institutions were important. EUGENE NG (Singapore)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the ASEAN  said the third Conference on Financing for Development would be “an opportune forum to reinvigorate the ODA commitments”  since such assistance continued to be a critical means of implementation for development.  He underscored the importance of South-South  North-South and triangular cooperation in capacity-building and sharing of experiences.  In that context  his country had shared its development expertise with over 80 000 Government officials from 17 countries through the Singapore Cooperation Programme  established in 1992 SALVADOR DE LARA RANGEL (Mexico) called for support for debt relief and access to products to help drive the financing of sustainable development.  The international community had achieved major successes in the past and could do so again.  The financing for development agenda was useful as it gave a broad vision of the challenges faced in mobilizing resources for development.  Its broad and holistic vision would provide the basis on which to discuss crucial topics  particularly the various means through which resources would be mobilized.  The holistic vision gave room for strengthening international economic governance while making national level improvements and the outcome should bring Monterrey and Doha up to date. ZAKIA EL MIDAOUI (Morocco)  aligning herself with the Group of 77 and China  African Group and the Arab Group  said the development financing conference offered a chance to assess progress and agree on resources for fulfilling the new agenda.  It had to account for the challenges faced by developing countries but also by the international community.  Environmental protection and peace and security had to be to the fore and financing needed to ensure partnerships that brought together all stakeholders.  Traditional and innovative solutions had to be considered and developed countries had to fulfil the commitments they had made.  It was vital to address the debt-servicing burden and States needed better access to markets.  Trade and ODA were vital but traditional assistance would not be enough to meet all the post-2015 needs.  Innovative tools would be needed to create additional resources and she noted that Morocco would host a regional conference on development that would focus on innovative financing to transform Africa. PETER VERSEGI (Australia) said to better reflect the changing nature of our financial relationships and knowledge frameworks  the upcoming conference in Addis Ababa would need to build on the Monterrey Consensus.  His country expected the conference to draw on the work of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts.  That work focused on the importance of empowering countries  and offered a framework  identified opportunities and outlined a range of policy options.  Effective domestic resource mobilization was vital to long-term economic growth and development.  Australia had worked with the Solomon Islands to help that country improve revenue collection and tax compliance.  There were estimates that developing countries lost upwards of $1 trillion through illicit financial flows.  He called on Member States to support the existing private sector inside developing countries by providing them with access to finance  and by developing local capital markets and finance institutions.  Priority should be afforded to boosting global trade while reducing the barriers to it. TUVAKO N. MANONGI (United Republic of Tanzania) associated himself with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group.  He said the third International Conference on Financing for Development should review the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus and Doha Declaration; address new and emerging issues related to the mobilization and use of financial resources for sustainable development; and reinvigorate the financing for development follow-up.  He called upon developed countries to fully implement their ODA commitments  and noted that since adoption of the Monterrey Consensus  developing countries had made strides in their capacity to mobilize domestic financial resources for development.  He expressed support for regional and international efforts to address illicit financial flows  including in the realm of extractive industries and called upon developed countries to play a bigger role in tackling such flows.  Finally  he underscored the importance of interaction among international groups that made policy recommendations or took policy decisions with global implications as well as the need for a multilateral mechanism to monitor and follow-up the fulfilment of their pledges and commitments to ensure accountability. A. K. ABDUL MOMEN (Bangladesh)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Group of Least Developed Countries  said the international financial system should be “more transparent  inclusive  participatory  and  above all  pro-poor and pro-development”.  It was important to ensure that the weak countries did not suffer from over-restricted steps by the major economies and major financial institutions globally.  As international trade was an engine for development  the agreement on least developed countries  reached in the Bali World Trade Organization Ministerial Meeting in 2013  must be fulfilled.  Those included the decisions on duty-free and quota-free market access for those countries  preferential rules of origin  and operationalization of the waiver concerning preferential treatment to services and service suppliers of such countries. NASREDDINE RIMOUCHE (Algeria)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the African Group  said there were shortcomings in the international financial and economic system  and the democratic deficit within international institutions only exacerbated inequalities persistent in the world economic order.  The new world hierarchy must be based on equality  sovereignty and stability  he said  calling for a global reform of the economic and financial system to promote development effectively and respond in an equitable way to the needs of developing countries.  International financial regulations must be improved by diminishing excessive risk-taking and capital flows  and developing countries must be included in decision-making processes.  On financing for development  there had been improvements  but a lack of funding remained.  Additional funds must be mobilized  taking into account new challenges such as climate change and natural disasters. APPOLINAIRE DINGHA (Congo)  aligning himself with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  said the intergovernmental committee’s work had sought to account for national realities.  The committee had also been inspired by the modalities and spirit that led to adoption of Rio+20 and Monterrey Consensus.  It had also worked in step with the Open Working Group.  The elimination of poverty remained the major challenge  as that Group had concluded.  ODA  while not a panacea for sustainable development of developing countries  was still very important  particularly in situations where there were limited capacities to raise resources.  South-South cooperation continued to grow and complement North-South cooperation and other innovative financing initiatives should also work to diversify sources of sustainable development financing.  He welcomed the tax on financial transactions that Eurozone countries intended to levy and pointed to a tax on oil that the Government would impose with the aim of fighting poverty. CAROLYN SCHWALGER (New Zealand) said that as a small open economy dependent on trade for the well-being of its people  her country had a strong interest in the continued prosperity of the global economy.  Distorting subsidies and trade protectionism limited the progress that could drive greater growth  create more jobs and lift people out of poverty  and the Doha Round was the best path to address them.  On financing for development  an evolving landscape had created a variety of new funding sources that could have a catalytic effect on global development outcomes.  With the needs of small island developing States a priority for her country  she urged the international community to focus on improving the well-being of citizens in smaller  vulnerable  resource- and capacity-constrained countries. ALI HAJILARI (Iran)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said “globalization” was “not translated in the real international financial structure”.  At a crucial moment in development history  the international community faced a very important responsibility.  Development goals would be achievable only if they had well defined means of implementation  if a sound economic and financial system was in place; and if responsible economic and financial behaviours of the countries with the lion’s share of the international economy were guaranteed.  The Conference on financing should review gaps and progress made in implementing the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration.  It should also establish a financing for development follow-up mechanism.  Reform of the global financial institutions had to be given a real voice to increase participation of developing countries  better regulate financial flows  improve exchange rate management and promote policy coordination. HELEN BECK (Solomon Islands) said the post-2015 agenda and its financing must be inclusive and universal.  A reform of the financial and economic system was critical for maintaining stability and for the implementation of the agenda.  A one-size-fits-all approach could not be applied; instead  special and unique circumstances of countries and regions should be recognized  and financing aligned with their national strategies.  Means of implementation were the cornerstone of sustainable development efforts for many States  and least developed countries and small island developing States must be recognized and represented in the allocation of funds.  With distribution of aid for trade crucial for some countries  she was concerned about the lack of will to complete the Doha Round. SERGIO SHCHERBAKOV (Ecuador)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and CELAC  said that it was essential to define funding sources for development and to establish an effective means of implementation.  The main challenge of the post-2015 agenda would be the efficiency of its implementation means.  Like other middle-income countries  Ecuador had imbalances and inequalities  which should be considered in the development agenda beyond the GDP measure. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-20,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gadis3506.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Unrealistic calls for disarmament distracted from — and ignored — more achievable and sober efforts  a speaker told the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) today  urging members to acknowledge the “hard truth” that the final goal would not be realized overnight or in a single negotiation. Some had called for “alternate  immediate  wholesale” approaches to nuclear disarmament  but real and lasting results would take sustained effort and commitment  said the United States’ representative  who was among the more than 50 speakers who took the floor during the thematic debate on nuclear weapons. In his view  a practical  step-by-step approach to disarmament had proven to be the most effective means to reduce nuclear dangers and fulfil the obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)  with each step building on past ones and providing a foundation for future actions.  The temporary inability to make progress in one area did not preclude progress in others. The United States  he said  shared the interest of all States in extending forever the nearly 70-year record of non-use of nuclear weapons.  However  any call to move nuclear disarmament into international humanitarian law circles could only distract from the practical agenda set forth in the 2010 NPT review.  Still  many delegations throughout the day highlighted the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons as a fundamental and global concern. Speaking on behalf of more than 150 countries  New Zealand’s representative said past experience from use and testing of nuclear weapons had amply demonstrated the unacceptable humanitarian consequences caused by their immense  uncontrollable  destructive capability and indiscriminate nature.  Broad participation at conferences on the humanitarian dimension of nuclear weapons was essential  she said  because their catastrophic consequences affected not only Governments  but each and every citizen of today’s interlinked world. Awareness of those appalling consequences must underpin all approaches and efforts towards nuclear disarmament. Encouraged that the humanitarian focus was now well-entrenched in the global agenda  she stressed that the only way to guarantee that nuclear weapons would never again be used was through their total elimination. In that vein  the representative of South Africa stressed that as long as nuclear weapons existed  humankind would continue to face that catastrophic threat.  Experience demonstrated that the indiscriminate nature of a detonation of those weapons reached “well beyond” national borders  leaving a “trail of death” and destruction in its wake.  Those long-term humanitarian  environmental  and socio-economic consequences would last for generations  he said.  Additionally  he said  vast public resources diverted towards nuclear weapons stood in “stark contrast” to the delivery of development assistance in support of the Millennium Development Goals.  Costs associated with maintaining nuclear arsenals were roughly more than double the development assistance provided to Africa. That was “neither acceptable nor sustainable” in a world where the basic human needs of billions were not being met. The representative of India said that increasing restraints on nuclear weapons would reduce the probability of their use and could contribute to their progressive de-legitimization. For discussions to be meaningful  it was important that they be inclusive  involving the participation of all States  including the nuclear Powers.  “We cannot simply put old wine into new bottles  or put new clothes on old treaties ” he said.  International consensus  said the representative of Pakistan  had eroded over time  and serious challenges confronted global efforts to regulate  reduce  and prevent the spread of armaments  particularly nuclear weapons.  Despite high rhetoric and moralistic assertions  the fact was that nuclear weapons remained integral to strategic doctrines of military alliances. Only the simultaneous pursuit of disarmament and non-proliferation could erect effective barriers against those risks  he said.  Nuclear disarmament would not happen overnight  or even in a lifetime.  But the effort to eliminate those weapons “must start now”.  In the course of the debate  speakers expressed frustration at the slow pace of progress  with several regretting  for example  that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty had not entered into force and that negotiations had not begun in earnest on a fissile material cut-off treaty.  Urgent calls were also made to convene a conference for the establishment of a zone free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. Delegations also introduced drafts on the following topics: accelerating the implementation of nuclear disarmament commitments; the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty; decreasing the operational readiness of nuclear weapons; Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia; reducing nuclear danger; convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons; measures to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction; united action towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons; and conclusion of effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. Also speaking today were representatives of Canada (on behalf of Group of Governmental Experts)  Indonesia (on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement)  Mexico (on behalf of the New Agenda Coalition)  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (on behalf of the Caribbean Community)  Nigeria (on behalf of the African Group)  Switzerland (on behalf of the De-Alerting Group)  Australia (joint statement  national capacity)  Suriname (on behalf of the Union of South American Nations)  Kazakhstan  Mexico (national capacity)  France  Cuba  Germany  Columbia  Iraq  Malaysia  Japan (national capacity)  Latvia  China  Qatar  Bangladesh  Japan (Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative)  Fiji  United Arab Emirates  Netherlands  Costa Rica  Brazil  Thailand  Lithuania  Guatemala  Senegal  Iran  Nigeria (national capacity)  Switzerland (national capacity)  Romania  Austria  Czech Republic  New Zealand (national capacity)  Canada (national capacity)  Singapore  Norway  Saudi Arabia  Portugal  Sweden  United Kingdom and Myanmar. A representative of the European Union delegation also participated. The Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. tomorrow  21 October  to continue its thematic debates. Background The First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) met today to begin its thematic discussion on nuclear weapons.  For more background  see Press Release GA/DIS/3497. Statements Elissa Golberg (Canada)  speaking on behalf of the Group of Governmental Experts  said that the Group’s first two sessions had been substantive and highly interactive.  Although the Group itself would not negotiate a treaty  as Chair she encouraged it to focus its work on the value it could provide to negotiators by undertaking a fact-based and policy-neutral analysis of all aspects of a future treaty.  The Group’s format had been particularly conducive to productive debates  she said; its informal nature and the time provided to the experts had allowed for deep and technical discussions.  As such  it had complemented and informed the more general discussions on a treaty  which took place in the Conference on Disarmament this year. During its first session  she said  widespread agreement had emerged that a treaty banning the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices should remain a priority.  Experts reaffirmed the Shannon Report and the mandate contained therein.  Overall  there were several issues on which the views of most  if not all  were quite similar.  Over the course of both sessions  the Group had focused in technical detail on definitions  scope  and verification  agreeing on the institutional structure of such an instrument.  There also was broad recognition of a “dynamic correlation” between each  and that no issue could be addressed in isolation from the others. DESRA PERCAYA (Indonesia)  speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  said the group was concerned about the threat to humanity posed by the existence of nuclear weapons and their possible use or threat of use.  Efforts aiming at non-proliferation should be parallel to simultaneous efforts towards nuclear disarmament.  Nuclear-weapon States must accomplish the total elimination of those weapons in a transparent and verifiable manner  and must cease efforts to upgrade or extend the lives of those weapons.  He called for the urgent  early commencement of a comprehensive nuclear weapon convention in the Conference on Disarmament  pursuant to General Assembly resolution 68/32.  The Movement was presenting an updated version of its draft resolution this session  which he hoped would garner universal support. He welcomed the increasing focus on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons  and looked forward to the upcoming conference on that topic in Austria in December.  Pending the total elimination of nuclear weapons  negotiations should commence on effective  unconditional  non-discriminatory  irrevocable  and legally binding security assurances for all non-nuclear-weapon States.  He strongly rejected the “alleged impediment” for not implementing the agreement reached at the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) on the Middle East and the 1995 resolution that emerged from the 1995 review.  He called for their full implementation  in order to avoid any additional possible negative repercussions.  The Movement remained ready to work constructively towards a world free of nuclear weapons  but that vision could only be realized if the required political will was demonstrated by all quarters. JORGE LOMÓNACO(Mexico)  speaking on behalf of the New Agenda Coalition (NAC) members (Brazil  Egypt  Ireland  New Zealand  South Africa  Mexico)  tabled draft resolution entitled  “Towards a nuclear weapon free world: Accelerating the implementation of nuclear disarmament commitments”.  NAC believed that the guarantee against the use of nuclear weapons was their total elimination  and in that connection  it continued to work for the NPT’s universalization.  The draft resolution reiterated deep concern about the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons.  It called on nuclear-armed States to fulfil their commitment to reduce all types of those weapons  while underlining that non-nuclear-weapon States had a legitimate interest in receiving unequivocal  binding  negative security assurances.  The text also urged all States to overcome obstacles within the international disarmament machinery inhibiting efforts to advance nuclear disarmament. Finally  it reaffirmed that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones would enhance global and regional peace and security. He also emphasized the need to implement the resolution on the Middle East adopted at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT States parties  and highlighted the importance of the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear- Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).  He called for the Treaty’s universalization  and urged India  Israel and Pakistan to accede to it as non-nuclear-weapon States  promptly and without conditions.  Finally  he called for full support of the draft. DELL HIGGIE (New Zealand)  speaking on behalf of 155 countries  said past experience from use and testing of nuclear weapons had amply demonstrated the unacceptable humanitarian consequences caused by the immense  uncontrollable  destructive capability and indiscriminate nature of those weapons.  The discussion at the first and second Conferences on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons had allowed the world to deepen its collective understanding of those consequences.  A key message emerging from experts and international organizations was that no State or international body could address the immediate humanitarian emergency caused by a nuclear-weapon detonation or provide adequate assistance to victims. She said that broad participation at conferences and plans to convene similar such international gatherings  reflected the recognition that the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons were a fundamental and global concern.  Such work was essential because their catastrophic consequences affected not only Governments  but each and every citizen of today’s interlinked world.  Awareness of those appalling consequences must underpin all approaches and efforts towards nuclear disarmament.  Indeed  the humanitarian consequences had been reflected in numerous United Nations resolutions and in multilateral instruments  including reviews of the NPT  she said  adding that expressions of profound concern remained as compelling as ever. Encouraged that the humanitarian focus was now well-established on the global agenda  she said the only way to guarantee that nuclear weapons would never again be used was through their total elimination.  All States shared the responsibility to prevent their use and proliferation  and to achieve nuclear disarmament  including by fulfilling the NPT’s objectives and achieving its universality.  Welcoming the renewed international community’s resolve to address those issues  she said civil society could play a crucial role side-by-side with Governments. INGA RHONDA KING (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines)  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  said that the Community was proud to be part of the first  densely populated region in the world to have declared itself a nuclear-weapon-free zone  thereby establishing the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (OPANAL).  She urged nuclear-weapon States to withdraw their reservations to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco)  which had been articulated in “interpretative declarations” issued when they signed the Treaty’s Additional Protocols.  Withdrawing those reservations would serve to eliminate the possible use of nuclear weapons in the region  she said.  Meanwhile  CARICOM believed that the establishment of such a zone should be replicated in other parts of the world where none currently existed. She said that it was only through the total elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction that international peace and security could be guaranteed.  The consequences of a nuclear detonation  whether accidental or intentional  would be of “catastrophic proportions”.  The Community’s member countries  owing to their limited resources  would be ill-equipped to address such a tremendous challenge.  Also worrying was the humanitarian impact and long-term consequences of a nuclear detonation.  With that  she welcomed the growing global attention to the issue  joining calls for the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the elimination of existing arsenals.  CARICOM was also concerned over the transit of hazardous nuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea  as an accident would have catastrophic consequences on the health  tourism  economies  and fragile ecological systems in the region. E.E. IMOHE (Nigeria)  speaking on behalf of the African Group and associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  reaffirmed that the total elimination of nuclear weapons remained the only absolute guarantee against their use or threat of use.  The world urgently needed to be free of nuclear weapons  including in outer space  as their presence presented an existential threat to the planet and the future survival of humanity.  Africa supported the principle of complete nuclear disarmament as the utmost prerequisite for maintaining international peace and security.  Africa’s status as nuclear-weapon-free acted as a shield for the continent  and the Group strongly supported the establishment of such a zone in the Middle East.  He welcomed the past two international conferences on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons  convened in Norway and Mexico  and looked forward to the third in Austria.  The Group had submitted a resolution on the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty  and sought delegations’ full support. URS SCHMID (Switzerland) speaking on behalf of the “De-Alerting Group”  discussed the importance of decreasing the operational readiness of nuclear weapons systems  a process known as “de-alerting”.  A significant number of nuclear weapons remained at high levels of alert  which multiplied the risks posed by those weapons and increased the possibility of an erroneous launch.  That presented an unacceptable danger to humanity  as it carried with it the possibility of killing millions of people.  Awareness of the risks associated with those weapons was crucial to lowering their operational readiness  which was a critical part of disarmament. De-alerting  he went on  was a prime example of a practical disarmament step  and progress in that area would strengthen the credibility of the NPT.  The Group welcomed the progress made in lowering the level of readiness of non-strategic nuclear weapons  which highlighted that de-alerting was possible and that political challenges could be met. Nevertheless  more work was needed.  As such  the De-Alerting Group would table the resolution “Decreasing the Operational Readiness of Nuclear Weapons”  with a view to de-alerting all such weapons.  He encouraged support for the resolution  adding that there was increasing recognition that decreasing alert levels was an important interim step towards a nuclear-weapon-free world. JOHN QUINN (Australia) spoke on behalf of Australia  Belgium  Bulgaria  Canada  Czech Republic  Estonia  Finland  Germany  Greece  Hungary  Italy  Japan  Lithuania  Luxembourg  the Netherlands  Poland  Portugal  Slovakia  and Spain.  He recalled his concern about the continuing nuclear weapon risks to humanity  saying that the desire for a peaceful future for successive generations underpinned his long-standing advocacy for progress on nuclear disarmament.  Stressing the need to spread awareness of the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons  he acknowledged significant reductions in the number of nuclear weapons worldwide  but regretted that some States continued to produce new nuclear weapons. Emphasizing the need for all States to urgently fulfil their disarmament commitments  he said that to facilitate major reductions in nuclear arsenals  the global community must address the security and humanitarian dimensions  notably  by mitigating hostility between States and building confidence.  He also highlighted practical contributions that could be made to advance non-proliferation and disarmament  such as unblocking the Conference on Disarmament; beginning negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty; and bringing into force the CTBT.  The inspection power of the IAEA must also be strengthened. NICOLE HEW A KEE (Suriname)  speaking on behalf of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR)  supported international efforts towards negotiating a universal and legally binding instrument that prohibited nuclear weapons.  The only guarantee against the use or threat of use of those weapons was their total elimination  she said  adding that their very existence diminished the security of all States  including those that possessed them.  UNASUR was deeply concerned about the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons  and reiterated its commitment to the NPT and to the balanced implementation of its three pillars.  However  the disarmament pillar had suffered from a serious “implementation deficit”  and new and concrete measures were needed in the next Review Conference. She said that States possessing nuclear weapons should urgently provide unequivocal and legally binding security assurances on their non-use  and should eliminate the role of those weapons in their security policies and military strategies.  Countries that had not yet signed or ratified the CTBT should do so as soon as possible as a sign of their political will and commitment to international peace and security.  UNASUR  which was proud of the formal proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a zone of peace  felt that the establishment of such a zone in the Middle East would be a significant contribution to the peace process there. KAIRAT ABDRAKHMANOV (Kazakhstan)  also speaking on behalf of Kyrgyzstan   Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan  said the Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty in Central Asia was an important milestone  through which the five signatories had made a significant contribution to strengthening regional and global security  and nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. He hoped that the security space around the area would continue to expand and that one day the entire planet would be nuclear-weapon-free. He urged all nuclear-armed States to ratify the Treaty’s Protocol  which provided the region with security assurances against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. During the current session  he said his country  on behalf of all five countries  would introduce a draft resolution  “Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia ” reflecting the progress made since the Treaty’s opening for signature in 2006.  The text also would reaffirm the signatories’ strong commitment to the effective implementation of disarmament and non-proliferation measures. He hoped the draft would receive Member States’ full support. IOANNIS VRAILAS  representative of the European Union Delegation  affirmed the group’s full support for all three pillars of the NPT and their implementation.  The Union also would continue to promote full implementation of the 2010 Action Plan.  Ensuring the implementation of the 64 actions in the Plan was a collective responsibility shared by all NPT States parties  without exception. In that context  he welcomed the encouraging steps taken by the United States and two European Union member countries  stressing that States with the largest arsenals had a “special responsibility” to reduce them.  In line with the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)  the Union encouraged the Russian Federation and the United States to seek further reductions in their nuclear arsenals. The Union also encouraged them to include non-strategic nuclear weapons in the next round of their bilateral nuclear arms reduction  he said  emphasizing the importance of further confidence-building measures to advance disarmament. He went on to express the European Union’s strong condemnation of the violation of several commitments by the Russian Federation.  He urged it to refrain from the threat or use of force against Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty  under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on security assurances and in connection with Ukraine’s accession to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon State.  It also condemned  in the strongest possible terms  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear test of February 2013  as well as that country’s threat of another.  That said  the Union urged that country to refrain from further “provocative actions”. JORGE LOMÓNACO (Mexico)  speaking in his national capacity  said some nuclear-weapon States continued to modernize their arsenals while others continued to increase them.  A great number of nuclear weapons were at high operational status and remained at the heart of deterrence strategies.  The nuclear-armed States also continued to allocate vast resources to maintain those stockpiles.  Many non-nuclear-weapon States also depended on those arsenals  and even hosted nuclear weapons from other countries on their national territory.  The threat was clear and ongoing.  While nuclear weapons continued to exist  there would always be someone wanting to acquire them.  The risk of a detonation  intentional or accidental  and the danger of those weapons’ use by non-state actors  remained an ongoing global threat.  Peace for all should not be sacrificed for the security of a few  he said  encouraging States to reflect on the terrible impact of nuclear weapons on humanity  and to use scientific data to understand those effects.  That  he added  should be the basis for all discussions on nuclear weapons.  All NPT States parties must meet their obligations  which should include a commitment to reach results and not merely express intention.  The possession of a nuclear arsenal was neither legal nor legitimate  and those weapons were not worthy of anything other than being stigmatized.  The United Nations had identified those weapons as unacceptable since the first General Assembly resolution.  History had shown that there was a need to prohibit the development  storage  possession  transfer  and use of weapons of mass destruction as a necessary step to eliminating them. D. BALA VENKATESH VARMA (India) said that increasing restraints on nuclear weapons would reduce the probability of their use and could contribute to their progressive de-legitimization.  That was an essential step towards their eventual elimination as well as that of chemical and biological weapons.  For discussions to be meaningful  it was important that they be inclusive  involving the participation of all States  including the nuclear Powers.  In terms of process  such talks should not “harm” the NPT or the established disarmament machinery.  “We cannot simply put old wine into new bottles  or put new clothes on old treaties ” he said.  Regarding the NPT  he said that his country’s position was well-known and needed no reiteration.  There was no question of India joining the Treaty as a non-nuclear weapon State.  At the same time  India would make its contribution to strengthening the global non-proliferation regime.  As such  it had ratified the Additional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in July. He went on to introduce a draft resolution on “Reducing Nuclear Danger”  which highlighted the need for a review of nuclear doctrines  and immediate steps to reduce the risk of unintentional or accidental use of nuclear weapons.  He also presented a draft resolution on a convention on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons  which reflected a belief that a multilateral  universal  and legally binding instrument prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would contribute to their de-legitimization.  As in previous years  India would also be tabling a draft resolution entitled “Measures to Prevent Terrorist from Acquiring Weapons of Mass Destruction”  which highlighted the international community’s continued concerns of the risks posed by the terrorist acquisition of weapons of mass destruction as well as sensitive materials and technologies. ROBERT WOOD (United States) said his country continued to undertake mutually reinforcing steps in pursuit of a world free of nuclear weapons; only a balanced approach to maintaining international security would move States closer to the world envisaged by President Barack Obama in Berlin last year.  That required both strengthening the global nuclear non-proliferation regime as well as working towards nuclear disarmament.  A practical  step-by-step approach to disarmament had proven to be the most effective means to reduce nuclear dangers and fulfil the obligations under the NPT.  Some had called for “alternate  immediate  wholesale” approaches to nuclear disarmament.  However  real and lasting disarmament would take sustained effort and commitment. The United States  he continued  did not have a predetermined set of steps to be taken in a specific order.  Rather  each step built on past steps and provided a foundation for future actions.  The temporary inability to make progress in one area did not preclude progress in others  or prevent the placement of building blocks for a comprehensive approach to disarmament.  The United States would pursue every avenue available to lay the groundwork for future efforts  but the “hard truth” was that the final goal of disarmament would not be realized overnight or in a single negotiation.  Unrealistic calls for immediate and total disarmament distracted from — and ignored — more achievable and sober efforts. The United States shared the interest of all States in extending forever the nearly 70-year record of non-use of nuclear weapons  he said.  He stressed that any call to move nuclear disarmament into international humanitarian law circles could only distract from the practical agenda set forth in the 2010 NPT review.  It was clear that the pragmatic  sustained approach had borne fruit  having achieved major reductions in the number of nuclear weapons and in fissile material stocks and infrastructure.  Despite existing tensions  the United States and the Russian Federation continued to successfully implement the New START  which was the most comprehensive nuclear arms-control agreement in more than 20 years.  American- and Russian-deployed nuclear weapons were now at their lowest point since the 1950s  and United States’ stockpiles had been reduced by 85 per cent. Five years ago in Prague  President Obama had called for a treaty to verifiably end the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons.  That was an absolutely essential step for global nuclear disarmament and the next logical multilateral step to cap nuclear arsenals.  The United States was actively working to reduce its own holdings of fissile material stocks  which had been permanently removed from its nuclear-weapon programmes.  His country also had “down-blended” approximately 140 metric tons of highly enriched uranium.  The United States was neither developing new nuclear weapons  nor pursuing any new nuclear missions.  Stockpile stewardship and management activities were intended only to sustain existing designs  modernize their safety and facilities.  Safety  security  and secure updates had contributed to the significant reduction in his country’s alert posture.  The path to a world free from nuclear weapons was a long one  but the international community should not ignore the progress that had been made  he said  adding that the next step was to move further down the path. JEAN-HUGUES SIMON-MICHEL (France) said the international community’s priority was to consolidate the NPT  in line with the 2010 Action Plan.  Along with its “P5” partners  France was making every effort to work in that direction.  It had signed the Protocol on the Central Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone and intended to ratify it before the end of the year.  France also was continuing its work on transparency and strengthening confidence.  At a national level  it had an exemplary record in the field of nuclear disarmament  including the complete and unilateral and irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear-test site and its plutonium and uranium production facilities. He said the nuclear non-proliferation crisis remained the most pressing concern  as an obvious hindrance to the continuation of efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament.  No progress had been seen with regard to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  which had threatened to conduct a fourth nuclear test and had launched numerous ballistic missiles.  With regard to the Iranian nuclear crisis  there were only two months until the expiration of the Geneva Agreement  and time was now of the essence.  An accord could still be reached  and France  within the “Group of Six”  remained determined and committed to negotiations.  Iran needed to make the necessary decisions to prove the exclusively peaceful purposes of its nuclear programme. France had never participated in an arms race of any kind  he noted  adding that it applied the principle of “strict efficiency”  while maintain its arsenal at the lowest possible level compatible with the strategic context.  The French deterrence in no way contravened international law and was strictly defensive in nature.  It was also exclusively meant to protect France’s vital interests in “extreme” self-defence circumstances. YADIRA LEDESMA (Cuba) welcomed the international support for the International Day against Nuclear Tests  noting that only 69 years after the use of the atomic bomb had it been possible to establish such a Day.  On nuclear-weapon-free zones  she said that Cuba belonged to a community that was a pioneer in establishing a zone of peace at the Second Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) summit in Havana.  As a member of both the Non-Aligned Movement and CELAC  Cuba would be working towards a broad convention to eliminate all nuclear weapons.  In that regard  the Movement would be presenting a follow up resolution that she hoped would enjoy broad support. She reaffirmed the inalienable right of all State parties to the NPT to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes  and thanked the IAEA for safeguards that ensured the safe use of that energy.  Nevertheless  Cuba demanded that nuclear-weapon States meet their obligation to eliminate their nuclear stockpiles  and eliminate the use of those weapons in their security doctrines and strategies.  Cuba supported a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and believed there was no reason why the call made at the 2010 NPT Review Conference should not be heeded.  Nor had the nuclear Powers heeded article VI of the NPT on negotiating an international treaty towards the elimination of nuclear weapons.  Concrete  binding  and irreversible steps must be taken in that regard  she stressed  adding that the Non-Aligned Movement had put forth a viable proposal for a gradual drawdown towards that goal. MICHAEL BIONTINO (Germany)  associating with the European Union  said that his country was a staunch supporter of complete nuclear disarmament.  Nuclear arsenals had been dramatically reduced and START was being implemented.  Despite the ongoing crisis in Ukraine  new talks should be given a chance as they offered a venue for each side to raise concerns regarding strategic stability.  “Global Zero”  however  could only be achieved by improving the security environment and enhancing confidence between partners.  Similarly  regarding the humanitarian consequences of nuclear-weapon detonation  progress depended on the security dimension.  Although the risk of nuclear war was much lower today than during the cold war  the risk of terrorist acquisition of nuclear devices had considerably increased.  That was why it was so important to strengthen the non-proliferation regime and nuclear security.  Germany called for the entry into force of the CTBT  and for immediate negotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile material.  He concluded that strong political will by all NPT States parties would achieve global zero — there were no shortcuts — and his country was committed to remain engaged in that process. MIGUEL CAMILO RUIZ (Colombia) said his country was a party to the NPT and a member of a nuclear-weapon-free zone.  Universalization of the NPT was absolutely necessary  he said  stressing that all States that had not done so should sign on as non-nuclear-weapon States.  He backed all efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons  and said it was essential to have effective compliance with the instruments already in force for nuclear security.  All “Annex 2” countries to the CTBT should ratify as soon as possible to allow its speedy entry into force. He expressed his country’s commitment to nuclear security  noting that it had signed the amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material  which broadened the spectrum of the Convention regarding the transport of nuclear material and nuclear facilities within States.  The Treaty of Tlatelolco  had created the first nuclear-weapon-free zone in a densely populated area  and he supported the establishment of such zones in all regions.  With that in mind  he urged the convening of a conference to address the matter of establishing a zone free of nuclear and other mass destruction weapons in the Middle East. OTHMAN AL JUHAISHI (Iraq)  endorsing statements by the Non-Aligned Movement and the Arab Group  reminded the international community that effective measures must be taken towards a nuclear-weapon-free world.  The total elimination of those weapons was the only way to eliminate their threat or use.  Towards that end  there was a need for a binding  unconditional agreement to assure non-nuclear weapon States that those weapons would not be used against them.  Establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East was very important  he said  deploring the delay in holding a conference on that topic.  He urged that it be held as soon as possible  in line with the 2010 NPT Action Plan and Review Conference.  To maintain the credibility of the NPT  the world community must step up its efforts to hold that meeting. The CTBT  to which Iraq was party  was an important instrument that promoted nuclear disarmament  and he urged the eight remaining States needed for its entry into force to ratify it.  That  he stressed  was critical as nuclear terrorism could undermine international peace and security.  The increasing number of terrorist groups required regional coordination  and measures to ensure they did not get their hands on nuclear weapons.  On that issue  Iraq urged all Member States to implement Security Council resolution 1540 (2004).    HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia) introduced a draft resolution entitled  “Follow-up to the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons” (document A/C.1/69/L.23).  On 8 July 1996  the International Court of Justice had recognized  for the first time in history  that the threat or use of nuclear weapons was generally contrary to the rules of international law as applicable to armed conflict  particularly the principles and rules of humanitarian law.  That opinion constituted a significant milestone in international efforts aimed at nuclear disarmament  by lending a moral argument for their total elimination. TOSHIO SANO (Japan) said that  as the only country to have suffered atomic bombings  Japan had firmly committed to strive for the realization of a world without nuclear weapons.  The tragedy caused by nuclear weapons must never again be repeated.  His delegation believed in a building-blocks approach  which had gained the international community’s gradual support.  As part of those ongoing efforts  Japan had submitted a draft resolution entitled “United action towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons ” which provided standard-setting on a wide range of issues related to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. While welcoming the unilateral and bilateral reductions of nuclear warheads taken by some nuclear-weapon States  he said those should evolve to multilateral negotiations.  While the five nuclear-weapon States carried out their tasks  the non-State parties to the NPT should not remain on the sidelines.  He urged those States to accede to the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States  and encouraged them to immediately start reducing their arsenals and eventually eliminate them.  The CTBT was another indispensable component towards a world free of nuclear weapons  and it should be brought into force as soon as possible.  His delegation was encouraged that China had started sending data to the International Data Centre in Vienna.  The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s ongoing nuclear and missile development was of grave concern  and he urged that country to abandon all nuclear weapons and related programmes. He placed great emphasis on the significance of spreading awareness of the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of the use of nuclear weapons across borders and generations.  That should underpin all efforts to succeed in non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament for a more secure world. KSENIJA JARANOVA (Latvia)  associating with the European Union  supported bilateral and multilateral efforts that complemented and advanced the goals of the NPT.  However  Latvia was reluctant to create parallel working formats  which might duplicate work.  The goals of the 2010 NPT Action Plan were still relevant and could only be achieved through comprehensive implementation.  States should agree to continue work on implementation after the 2015 Review Conference  and pursue efforts to increase transparency and build confidence.  Ukraine’s transfer of the world’s third largest nuclear arsenal to the Russian Federation  and accession to the NPT  complemented by the Budapest Memorandum  was seen as the biggest achievements for the NPT.  It was deeply worrying that one party had violated the memorandum and called into question the credibility of the NPT and that of other agreements.  In view of the grave and horrendous humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons’ use  the world could not afford a fragmented approach in the run-up to the NPT Review Conference. WU HAITAO (China) advocated the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.  His country was always committed to a nuclear strategy of self-defence; it had never threatened any other country with its nuclear weapons  nor had it ever provided a nuclear umbrella for any other country or deployed nuclear weapons on another territory.  No-first-use of those weapons could lower their threat  reduce the risks of nuclear war and prevent their proliferation.  China had always honoured its commitments and would not be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and in any circumstance.  It was the only nuclear-weapon State to have made and honoured that commitment. China  he went on  supported the purposes and principles of the CTBT and it had strictly abided by its commitments to a moratorium on nuclear tests.  Moreover  it was preparing for the Treaty’s national implementation.  His country stood for concluding a verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty as early as possible in the Conference on Disarmament  in accordance with the Shannon Report.  China actively carried out research on nuclear arms control verification technologies  and had made important progress in that regard.  China was of the view that nuclear transparency should be guided by a principle of “undiminished security for all”  and relevant measures should be adopted by countries on a voluntary basis  in line with their national situation and taking into account their specific security conditions. ALI RASHID AL-MUHANNADI (Qatar)  associating with the Arab Group and Non-Aligned Movement  expressed concern over the stalemate in the Conference on Disarmament and the failure to arrive at a programme of work.  His country was also concerned about the lack of progress in disarmament  and looked forward to a minimum set of objectives that would advance progress in that area.  Despite the commitments to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East  the conference on that topic had not convened due to the failing of a “primary party”.  In view of that  Qatar questioned whether the region was ready to build such a zone and whether there was a serious will to divert resources spent on nuclear weapons for development. He urged the eight “Annex 2” countries that had not yet done so to ratify the CTBT  stating that it was particularly important  given the current situation in the Middle East and the risk that terrorists in the region could gain access to those weapons.  For its part  Qatar had established laws to prevent nuclear weapons smuggling as well as a National Committee dedicated to this purpose.  At the same time  he stressed the rights of NPT States parties to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. FARUK HOSSAIN (Bangladesh)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that nuclear technology had long been recognized as capable of both tremendous benefits and tremendous destruction.  Nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation were closely interlinked.  As long as there remained weapons of mass destruction in the hands of some States  no matter who they were  there remained a motivation for others to acquire them.  The risk of their use  either by accident or by design  posed grave danger  especially given the possibility of those weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.  Therefore  disarmament and non-proliferation must be pursued with equal importance and urgency. Negative security assurances  he stressed  were vital to furthering non-proliferation objectives  in that they discouraged non-nuclear-weapon States from opting for those weapons.  Establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in all parts of the world was also of great importance.  The CTBT was a critical instrument and an essential step  and  therefore  its urgent and unconditional signature and ratification would be a great step forward.  The agenda for dealing with nuclear weapons had evolved widely in recent years  with the added dimensions of preventing non-State actors from acquiring them and their humanitarian consequences.  Bangladesh supported both of those additions to the agenda. TOSHIO SANO (Japan)  speaking on behalf of the countries of the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative  cited the testimonies of atomic bomb survivors during the group’s trip this year to Hiroshima  as further propelling its commitment to achieving a world free of nuclear weapons.  With that  he reaffirmed that the only guarantee against the use or threat of use of those weapons was their total elimination. He said that despite the positive impact of unilateral and bilateral reductions  those measures do not replace multilateral negotiations towards the ultimate elimination of all types of nuclear weapons.  Reductions should be accompanied by steps towards reducing the role and significance of nuclear weapons in security strategies and military doctrines.  Increasing the transparency of information about nuclear forces was another issue of importance to the Initiative  as  without it  nuclear disarmament could not be verified.   Recognizing the serious threat of nuclear terrorism  he affirmed the group’s commitment to strengthening nuclear security; also  he condemned the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs  which undermined the NPT and posed a great threat to global peace and stability. PETER THOMSON (Fiji)  speaking on behalf of the Federated States of Micronesia  Kiribati  Nauru  Palau  Papua New Guinea  Republic of the Marshall Islands  Samoa  Tonga  Solomon Islands  Tuvalu and Vanuatu  said the group was committed to finding durable solutions so that nuclear weapons would never be used again.  For half a century  more than 315 nuclear tests had been carried out in neighbouring countries  covering the region with radioactive fallout.  This year marked 60 years since the largest nuclear test was conducted in Fiji  with the incident leaving many in the region suffering from long-term effects  including higher rates of cancer.  In some affected areas  the environment and food sources remained highly contaminated.  With this history in mind  he welcomed the renewed focus on the humanitarian impact of the use and testing of nuclear weapons. As long as weapons of mass destruction existed  he said  they would be used again.  The CBTB treaty and the regional nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties had brought the world a step closer to the non-proliferation treaty’s two core objectives.  Finally  he said that nuclear armed states must take all measures to reduce the risk of an accidental launch  and to make sure that such weapons did not fall into the hands of terrorist groups. JAMAL JAMA AHMED ABDULLA AL MUSHARAKH (United Arab Emirates)  associating with the Arab Group  the Non-Aligned Movement and the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative  said that disarmament and non-proliferation were two essential methods for the achievement of international peace and security.  The accession to all instruments for those processes was of particular importance  especially the NPT.  The United Arab Emirates had become a party to it in 1995  and had acceded to the CTBT and other related instruments.  He expressed concern over the lack of progress towards achieving a zone free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East.  As for its own peaceful use of nuclear energy  the United Arab Emirates had built its first nuclear reactor in 2012 and another in 2013  and began construction of a third last month.  His country was committed to working with the IAEA with regard to those facilities. HENK COR VAN DER KWAST (Netherlands)  associating with the European Union  said his country remained committed to a world without nuclear weapons  and did not agree that the international strategic situation was a reason to stop nuclear disarmament.  The security dimension and the humanitarian consequences underpinned his country’s efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.  The Netherlands would be voting in favour of the resolution on decreasing the operational readiness of nuclear weapon system.  He added that the entry into force by the CTBT and a treaty banning the production of fissile material for military purposes were essential multilateral elements.  Acknowledging the importance of the Conference on Disarmament  he deplored the lack of negotiations.  He  meanwhile  underscored that the five nuclear-weapon States commit to accelerate progress on the steps leading to nuclear disarmament.  He welcomed the implementation of the New START by the United States and the Russian Federation.  He supported negotiations between “E3+3” Governments and Iran about the latter’s nuclear programme  and welcomed the progress.  MARITZA CHAN (Costa Rica)  associating with the statement by New Zealand on behalf of more than 155 States on the devastating humanitarian consequences from nuclear-weapon use  stressed the immediate need to eliminate those weapons as the best way to prevent their intentional or accidental use.  Costa Rica and Malaysia had summited a proposal for a model nuclear weapons convention to previous NPT Review Conferences  which could be negotiated either as a whole or be achieved through a package of agreements.  A legal prohibition on the use  possession  stockpiling  and development of nuclear weapons could be pursued now  even if the nuclear-armed States were unwilling to participate in the negotiations.  The CTBT must enter into force  and concrete progress was needed towards a fissile material ban. She said that  while small steps had been made towards reducing the global stockpiles of nuclear weapons  progress had been insufficient.  Costa Rica totally rejected the modernization of existing programmes and development of new types of nuclear weapons as inconsistent with existing international obligations.  She urged nuclear-armed States to immediately decrease the operational readiness of those weapons.  A strong supporter of NPT  Costa Rica considered it unfortunate that it had been plagued with challenges.  In closing  she said the humanitarian paradigm must drive efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons. ANTONIO DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil) introduced the draft resolution  entitled “Nuclear-weapon-free southern hemisphere and adjacent areas”  also on behalf of New Zealand.  Highlighting its key elements  he said the text reaffirmed the conviction of the important role of such zones in strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime  and in moving towards the goal of the total elimination of those weapons.  The resolution welcomed the cooperation between States parties and signatories to establish those treaties  as well as the nuclear-weapon-free status of Mongolia  and noted with satisfaction that all existing treaties were now in force.  The resolution also called on all relevant States to sign and ratify their protocols and welcomed steps towards the establishment of other such zones  on the basis of arrangements arrived at between the concerned States.  Moreover  the text encouraged efforts towards the convening of the third Conference of States parties and signatories on nuclear-weapons-free zones. CHAYAPAN BAMRUNGPHONG (Thailand)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said there was no reasonable objection to nuclear disarmament  which should be treated as substantively interrelated with non-proliferation.  He stressed the need to raise awareness in all sectors of Government and society  and promote their participation on issues of nuclear safety  security  and safeguards.  The right to peaceful use of atomic energy must be protected  as nuclear power was not only about destruction but also about development.  Nuclear-weapon-free zones were as essential to nuclear disarmament as they were to regional and global peace and security  he said.  He expressed hope that the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone would be realized as early as possible.  Heartened by the momentum created by global conferences on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons  Thailand stressed the need to explore concrete measures such as a legal instrument to comprehensively ban those weapons  with clear and implementable timetables. NIDA YAKUBONĖ (Lithuania)  associating with the European Union  said it was essential to maintain an inclusive approach and avoid fragmentation in the quest for a world without nuclear weapons.  The process should consist of a solid framework of mutually reinforcing and complementary treaties  institutions and commitments; it must as inclusive as possible and involve State possessors.  The international community had several  multilateral building blocks; yet  there was an urgent need for further steps in that direction.  Lithuania called for the entry into force of the CTBT and the conclusion of a fissile material cut-off treaty.  As a non-nuclear weapon State  it considered confidence-building measures to be an essential part of the nuclear arms control regime  and it remained committed to ensuring the development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  Although that regime and the IAEA verification system had prevented the significant spread of nuclear weapons  they had not completely stopped their proliferation.  By illegally occupying Ukraine  the Russian federation had violated its obligations under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum and the United Nations Charter.  Those violations had serious ramifications on the NPT  and Lithuania strongly condemned them. JOHANN KELLERMAN (South Africa)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  the African Group and the New Agenda Coalition  said that  as long as nuclear weapons existed  humankind would continue to face the threat of catastrophe.  Experience  he stressed  demonstrated that the immense  uncontrollable capability  and indiscriminate nature of a detonation of those weapons reached “well beyond” national borders  leaving a “trail of death” and destruction in its wake.  This impact  including the long-term humanitarian  environmental  and socio-economic consequences  would last for generations  he said.  Vast public resources diverted towards nuclear weapons stood in “stark contrast” to the delivery of development assistance in support of the Millennium Development Goals.  In fact  the costs associated with maintaining nuclear arsenals was roughly more than double the development assistance provided to Africa.  That state of affairs was “neither acceptable nor sustainable” in a world where the basic human needs of billions were not being met. YASAR AMMAR (Pakistan) said that serious challenges confronted global efforts to regulate  reduce  and prevent the spread of armaments  particularly nuclear weapons.  Consensus had broken down over time.  Despite reductions in existing nuclear arsenals  nuclear disarmament remained an outstanding objective on the international security agenda.  The erosion of international consensus could be seen in the opposition by most nuclear-weapon States to a nuclear disarmament convention  the non-entry into force of the CTBT  and continued reliance on nuclear weapons in security doctrines.  Only the simultaneous pursuit of disarmament and non-proliferation could erect effective barriers against those risks.  Yet  despite high rhetoric and moralistic assertions  the fact was that nuclear weapons remained integral to strategic doctrines of military alliances. He said that Pakistan recognized that nuclear disarmament would not happen overnight  or even in a lifetime.  But the effort to eliminate those weapons “must start now”.  The United Nations Charter obliged all States to not use or threaten to use force  and the time was ripe to negotiate negative security assurances at the Conference on Disarmament.  In pursuit of those assurances  Pakistan would be presenting the traditional draft resolution entitled  “Conclusion of effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons ” on behalf of 19 co-sponsors. MARÍA SOLEDAD URRUELA ARENALES (Guatemala) said that consensus could not be a synonym for the lowest common denominator.  She was not willing to let the nuclear-weapon States determine when nuclear disarmament would happen  but rather the international community must pursue that initiative multilaterally.  Weapons of mass destruction indiscriminately affected civilians  with devastating effects that would continue “for a generation”.  Nuclear weapons could cause the destruction of the planet and the human race  and were against the principles of the United Nations Charter.  Given the risk they presented  it was “incomprehensible” that those weapons had not yet been banned  and did not enjoy a legally binding instrument  as was seen with other weapons of mass destruction. She urged the international community to mitigate the risk and danger of those weapons  insisting on a moratorium on nuclear tests until CTBT entered into force.  Guatemala was proud to be a member of the Treaty of Tlatelolco  which was an example and an inspiration to others to conclude nuclear-weapon-free zones.  The Treaty members must continue to ensure that the region did not suffer the risk of a nuclear threat.  With that  she called for a withdrawal of all interpretive statements of that Treaty  and regretted that there had not yet been a conference for such a zone in the Middle East. IBRAHIMA SORY SYLLA (Senegal)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  reaffirmed their attachment to a world free from nuclear weapons.  That issue required the attention of the entire international community.  That threat was heightened  as those weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists.  As a result  their complete elimination was the only assurance that they would never be used.  Despite the lack of consensus in the NPT Preparatory Committee  he urged the 2015 NPT Review Conference parties to negotiate in good faith.  While nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation were two distinct goals  efforts must go hand-in-hand with an irreversible timetable.  He reminded the international community that declaring good intentions would not rid the world of those weapons.  It was up to all to harness the political will to achieve the necessary results. SEYED MOHAMMAD ALI ROBATJAZI (Iran)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that the continued non-compliance of nuclear-weapon States with their legal NPT obligations on nuclear disarmament  had undermined the object and purpose of that Treaty.  Nuclear weapons were not built to be kept in storage.  The military doctrines of certain nuclear-weapon States  as well as of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  justified the use of such inhumane weapons under certain circumstances.  Ongoing plans for modernizing existing nuclear weapons  and spending billions of dollars to build new nuclear-weapon facilities  under the pretext of preserving the safety and reliability of those weapons  ran counter to the unequivocal undertaking of nuclear-armed States to proceed with disarmament. It was a source of great concern  he continued  that hundreds of nuclear weapons and their delivery means continued to be deployed in the territories of certain non-nuclear-weapon States of the European Union  in violation of article I of the NPT.  Further  the possession of nuclear weapons by the infamous Israeli regime  coupled with its systematic practice of occupying territories of other nations and committing aggression  terrorism  war crimes  and crimes against humanity in the region  remained the greatest source of insecurity and instability for the NPT States parties in the region. CHUKA C. UDEDIBIA (Nigeria) associated with the Non-Aligned Movement  the African Group  as well as with the joint statements by New Zealand  Switzerland  and Japan.  On behalf of the African Group  he introduced the draft resolution entitled  “African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty”  also known as the Treaty of Pelindaba.  He called for universal support of the text  which emphasized Africa’s strong commitment to maintaining the zone.  The Nigerian delegation saw such zones as a credible means of promoting nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  Their significance lay not only in the fact that they banned nuclear weapons in a region  but also in that they prohibited the stationing of those weapons in States parties’ territories.  He noted the “initial setback” on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons  and called on all stakeholders to work towards its success. Mr. SCHMID (Switzerland)  in his national capacity  said that compelling new arguments had emerged which underlined the urgency and importance for comprehensive progress in disarmament  non-proliferation  and nuclear security.  The humanitarian narrative underscored the need to revitalize the disarmament machinery and to strengthen existing processes.  In the NPT context  the humanitarian dimension had accentuated the strong expectations that outstanding disarmament obligations would be implemented.  It had also sparked a discussion on how to more systematically advance the implementation of NPT article VI  including through additional global norms.  A successful outcome of the 2015 NPT Review Conference must generate clear  forward movement for nuclear disarmament. SIMONA MIRELA MICULESCU (Romania)  associating with the European Union  strongly backed all initiatives aimed at supporting the Conference on Disarmament to fulfil its mandate and begin negotiations on its agenda items  particularly on a fissile material cut-off treaty.  The “world outside these walls” was paying increased attention to the nuclear disarmament process  she noted  adding it was the international community’s common duty to relentlessly continue efforts to fully implement the NPT.  At the same time  Romania was looking forward to further reductions in nuclear arsenals  and welcomed the willingness of the United States to continue to work on that issue.  As a non-nuclear-weapon State  Romania supported the right of States to benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy  so long as non-proliferation  safety  and security conditions were met.  She highlighted Security Council resolution 1540 (2004)  which Romania had co-sponsored  saying she was encouraged by the steady progress by Member States to enact national measures to implement its provisions. THOMAS HAJNOCZI (Austria)  associating with the European Union and the joint statement by New Zealand  said that the humanitarian imperative underlay all efforts in disarmament and non-proliferation.  Better awareness of the consequences of a nuclear detonation  as well as a better understanding of the risks associated with the existence of nuclear weapons  would build momentum for achieving nuclear disarmament.  The Vienna Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons would take place on 8 and 9 December and provide for a facts-based discussion on a wide range of short- and long-term consequences of nuclear-weapon explosions.  It would also put emphasis on nuclear-weapon testing  discuss the range of human and technical factors that could lead to a nuclear-weapon explosion  as well as the response capabilities and challenges of the international system in that event. While he welcomed the steps taken by nuclear-weapon States in nuclear disarmament and arms control as important unilateral and bilateral progress  he said that they were not enough.  Survivors of nuclear tests were a reminder of the imperative to renew the world community’s commitment to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation  for the achievement of a world without nuclear weapons. VERONIKA STROMSIKOVA (Czech Republic)  associating with the European Union  expressed support for universal adherence to the NPT and full compliance with its obligations.  Even the most turbulent political and social unrest did not dismiss or diminish States’ responsibility to secure all nuclear and radioactive material on their territories.  The international community must preserve and strengthen the integrity of the NPT  she said  noting several breaches of international commitments.  Citing the annexing of Crimea  she said the Russian Federation had acted in “flagrant” breach of its obligations under the Budapest Memorandum  and endangered the integrity of the non-proliferation regime.  Another blatant challenge to that regime was the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear test of February 2013  which threatened security both in the region and around the globe.  Ms. HIGGIE (New Zealand) stressed the specific obligation upon the international community to comply with international humanitarian law.  She acknowledged the need to “operationalize” the same elemental notions of humanity  which had  in previous decades  led the international community to expressly ban other types of weapons of mass destruction.  At the Preparatory Committee for the 2015 NPT Review Conference  the New Agenda Coalition  of which New Zealand was a member  had put forward a working paper (WP 18)  outlining a set of options for the effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament  as stipulated in the Treaty’s article VI.  New Zealand remained keen to continue the conversation initiated in that paper.  She also referenced her country’s joint statement on the Humanitarian Consequences of Nuclear Weapons on behalf of more than 125 countries  which conveyed deep concern at the catastrophic consequences of those weapons. MUZAMMIL MEHDI (Canada) said all States possessing nuclear weapons must demonstrate maximum discipline to reassure the global community that they were committed to achieving a world free of nuclear weapons.  The NPT  despite its shortcomings  was the most widely adhered to instrument on non-proliferation  arms control  and disarmament in history  and could not be allowed to fail.  An essential element of ensuring the success of the 2015 Review Conference would be to prevent States from seeking nuclear-weapon capabilities  and ensure that those who violated their non-proliferation obligations were held to account. He said his country was deeply concerned by persistent failure of State compliance with their treaty obligations.  He cited the cases of Iran and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.  The Russian Federation’s military intervention in Ukraine and violation of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum was also deeply worrying  he said; he urged Moscow to resolve concerns regarding its compliance with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty.  Stressing the value of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices  Canada also sought the prompt entry into force of the CTBT.  It was committed to working with like-minded States  organizations  and initiatives to address the grave security challenge posed by nuclear terrorism. TAN WEIMING (Singapore) said the 2015 NPT Review Conference would be taking place against a backdrop of growing global instability  with broad gaps remaining on key issues.  All stakeholders must consider how to further progress on the three pillars of the treaty  he said.  For its part  Singapore acknowledged that nuclear disarmament was a long-term aspiration.  While the P5 consultations on disarmament were a positive step  he encouraged the United States and the Russian Federation to commence discussions on reducing their nuclear arsenals.  Nuclear-weapon States that fell outside the NPT should be involved in disarmament discussions to preserve the legitimacy and universalization of the Treaty.  His country urged all to act  including to work on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East  to sign and ratify the CTBT and to make progress on the fissile material cut-off treaty.  He encouraged the nuclear-weapon States to participate in discussions on the humanitarian aspect.  Risks of the proliferation of nuclear technology must also be addressed through enhancing nuclear security systems and implementing key international instruments  he added.  In closing  he reaffirmed the right of sovereign States to the peaceful use of nuclear science and technology. HALVOR SÆTRE (Norway) said there had been limited progress in the implementation of nuclear disarmament actions set out in the 2010 non-proliferation Action Plan.  A humanitarian perspective had led to a renewed interest in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation  he said  also drawing attention to the risks and consequences of continued collective inaction.  In that regard  Norway remained a staunch supporter of bilateral disarmament measures  such as the New START  which was vital to reducing existing nuclear weapon arsenals.  Underlining that a world free of nuclear weapons required a credible non-proliferation regime  his country hoped for additional steps to bring the CTBT into force.  Concluding  he urged Iran to settle issues related to its nuclear programme  and strongly condemned the nuclear and missile tests carried out by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. SAAD ABDULLAH N. AL SAAD (Saudi Arabia) said a lack of credibility of international instruments posed a challenge to international peace and security.  Despite the universality of the non-proliferation treaty and the conviction that it was the cornerstone of the international disarmament and non-proliferation regime  multilateral efforts did not meet expectations.  It was necessary to find ways and means of serious negotiations.  The Middle East had witnessed challenges that required concerted efforts to prevent a degeneration of the current situation.  Genuine partnership at the international level was urgently needed  as no country could face such challenges alone.  Security safeguards within the non-proliferation regime and the situation in the Middle East were intertwined  he said.  He added that  as long as Israel refused to place its nuclear programme under IAEA inspection  tensions would continue.  Supporting the establishment of a zone free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East  he said Israel was behind the postponement of the conference on that matter.  The international community bore responsibility for convening the conference as soon as possible  he said in closing. ÁLVARO MENDONÇA E MOURA (Portugal)  associating with the European Union  said striving for a world without nuclear weapons required tireless determination and concrete  consistent  and sustainable action.  While acknowledging progress made  Portugal recognized that much remained to be done.  The catastrophic consequences for humanity that would result from the accidental or deliberate use of nuclear weapons called for resolute  urgent  and appropriate action  he said. He added that non-proliferation and disarmament were mutually reinforcing processes  which should be resolutely pursued in a balanced manner.  The right of States to develop civil nuclear capabilities must be accompanied by strict adherence to relevant international agreements and commitments  in a transparent and responsible manner.  It was urgent to ensure the entry into force of the CTBT  and the commencement of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty. ULF LINDELL (Sweden)  associating with the European Union and New Zealand  said the new security challenges  such as the acquisition by non-State actors of nuclear weapons  required new security approaches.  Progress on the three pillars of the NPT was of the essence.  Although nuclear-weapon States committed to eliminating their nuclear arsenal without preconditions  he noted the re-emerging of preconditions in current disarmament discussions.  He welcomed the decrease of nuclear weapons  but said the work was far from being completed.  Of particular concern were the renewed efforts by nuclear-weapon States to modernize their nuclear arsenal.  He commended proposals to disarm further  and added that other building blocks were needed: the start of negotiations on a fissile material ban; the entry into force of the CTBT; the increased transparency of nuclear arsenals; and the strengthening of nuclear-weapon-free zones. He urged the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to return to full compliance with its NPT safeguards obligations.  He also regretted that Iran had failed to abide by relevant Security Council resolutions.  Sweden supported the efforts by China  France  Germany  the Russian Federation  the United Kingdom and United States to seek a diplomatic solution.  He urged all States to accede to the NPT and encouraged them to develop transparency and confidence-building measures.  Sweden welcomed the nuclear security summits  and was actively engaged in that process.  The country would continue its nuclear security cooperation with Georgia  the Republic of Moldova  the Russian Federation and Ukraine. MATTHEW ROWLAND (United Kingdom) said the best way to achieve a nuclear-free world was through a gradual  step-by-step approach.  While his country was deeply concerned at the humanitarian consequences that could result from the use of nuclear weapons  it did not share the view that nuclear weapons were inherently unacceptable. He pointed out that those weapons had helped guarantee the security of his country and its allies for decades.  “Frustration rarely makes for sound action ” he noted  adding that there were “no quick fixes” to nuclear disarmament.  The right political and security conditions for those States without nuclear weapons were not in place for them to feel no need to acquire them.  Similarly  the right conditions were not present for nuclear-weapon States to no longer feel the need to keep them.  Tackling proliferation challenges would contribute to creating those conditions  he said  adding that each Member State could play its part.  The United Kingdom nuclear disarmament record was strong  with reductions of its own nuclear forces by more than 50 per cent since the height of Cold War.  By the mid-2020s  the country would have reduced its nuclear forces to no more than 120 operationally available warheads  and a total stockpile of no more than 180 warheads. KYAW TIN (Myanmar)  speaking on behalf of 47 delegations  introduced the draft resolution entitled “Nuclear disarmament” (A/69/C.1/L.31).  The draft resolution would have the General Assembly urge the Conference on Disarmament to commence negotiations on a phased programme of nuclear disarmament  leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a specific timeframe.  The draft text would also have the Assembly call upon all nuclear-weapon States to take the 13 practical steps for nuclear disarmament and the 22-point Action Plan on Nuclear Disarmament  contained in the Final Document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference.  The Assembly would  by the draft text  call on nuclear-weapon States to provide effective assurances to all non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.  Securing an early agreement on a universal  unconditional  irrevocable  and legally-binding instrument on Negative Security Assurances (NSA)  was extremely important to all non-nuclear-weapon States  he noted. The draft resolution would also have the Assembly encourage Member States to continue their endeavours for establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones  including in the Middle East.  The draft text also would have it welcome the establishment of 26 September as the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons  along with a General Assembly Plenary Meeting.  The draft also took note of several upcoming meetings  including the Oslo and Nayarit conferences  as well as the Third Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons to be held in Vienna. Right of reply The representative of France  speaking in exercise of right of reply  recalled that his country had been among the first to ratify the NPT.  France dismantled  in an irreversible manner  its nuclear test sites in French Polynesia and had provided exemplary transparency.  He recalled that the IAEA had published a report confirming France’s compliance on the matter  and underscored that his country was very conscious of its obligations under both the NPT and the CTBT.  France was not making any new nuclear weapons and had maintained its capabilities at the lowest level.  He specified that in the last 20 years  France had eliminated half of its nuclear warheads  and reduced its submarine and aerial capabilities by a third.  It had also dismantled its fissile material production facility  making France an example in the field of disarmament. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-20,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaef3402.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. As the Second Committee (Economic and Financial) met to consider poverty eradication today  the representative of Benin  on behalf of the Group of Least Developed Countries  told delegates that the United Nations should make it its “utmost priority” to help such countries to “bridge the capacity gap” in the face of the extreme challenges they faced. Calling for enhanced international support for poverty eradication in the form of official development assistance (ODA)  greater investment  technology transfer and cancellation of debt  he said he felt that the Secretary-General’s report on Implementation of the Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2008-2017) needed a more ambitious approach “to foster the necessary drive” to achieve the objectives of the second decade. Several speakers who were representing groups underlined how hard it would be to achieve the goals of the second decade  with Malawi’s representative  who spoke for the African Group  noting that efforts to confront poverty and unemployment had not yielded optimal results due to a lack of progress in reaching millions of impoverished people in most developing countries. The United Nations development agenda should accord priority to poverty eradication  he said  calling on donor countries to support developing countries’ national efforts and the United Nations Social Protection Floor Initiative.  At the same time  they should scale-up financial and technical assistance so that developing countries could establish their own social security mechanisms. The representative of Singapore  speaking on behalf of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  said her region’s framework for poverty eradication dealt heavily with rural poverty because it was often the root of urban poverty.  The framework stressed community empowerment to bring sustainable development to rural areas  with an approach that involved Government agencies  the private sector and others to ensure programmes were relevant and holistic. It was widely noted that women’s advancement was impeded by widening inequalities  unemployment  violence and exploitation  with Bolivia’s representative  who spoke on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  saying investment in the education of women and girls would have “multiplier effects in society”. That sentiment was echoed by Norway’s delegate  who said poverty had many faces but a “majority of them belonged to women”.  He added that important aspects of gender equality were left out of the Millennium Development Goals  and must be brought onto the new development agenda.  Women’s access to decent jobs  equal pay and equal sharing of domestic chores  equal rights to property  land and inheritance  and to participate fully in politics and the economy  were other important elements that should figure prominently. Inclusion of women was one element of the case Peru’s delegate made on the issue of financial inclusion  which contributed to the achievement of numerous development outcomes.  He welcomed the concept’s inclusion in the proposal made by the Open Working Group on the Sustainable Development Goals.  By 2030  all men and women  particularly the poor and vulnerable  should have an equal right to economic resources and access to financial services  including microfinance. Argentina’s representative also stressed the importance of social equity  stating that it was only possible through balanced and just economic development.  To eliminate global poverty  wealth should be shared between regions and populations most in need  while a new global financial framework should be established that represented developing countries more justly. Echoing a statement made by the representative of Suriname  who spoke on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  the representative of Maldives said it was impossible to talk of poverty alleviation without emphasizing climate resilience measures.  Poverty eradication efforts had to be “climate proof”. Presenting reports for the Committee’s consideration were the Chief of the Research and Data Section  UN-Women; the Chief of the Social Perspective on Development Branch  Department of Economic and Social Affairs; the Coordinator for Strategic Planning in the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO); and the Deputy Special Representative of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). Also taking part in today’s debate were representatives of South Africa  Brazil  Israel  Malaysia  Nigeria  United States  and Algeria. The Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. on 21 October  to take up the International financial system and development  and Financing for development. Background The Second Committee (Economic and Financial) met this afternoon to consider eradication of poverty and other development issues.  The Committee had before it several reports related to its agenda (documents A/69/223  A/69/204  A/69/331  and A/69/156). Introduction of Reports SHAHRA RAZAVI  Chief of the Research and Data Section  UN-Women  said the World Survey on the Role of Women in Development examined topics fundamental to women’s lives and achieving equality.  Those items included economic growth; food production  distribution and consumption; population and women’s bodily integrity; and the need for investment in sanitation  energy and other areas.  It showed the impact of poor policies on gender inequality and stressed the need for investment in knowledge and decision-making power of women.  It dealt with the role of States and partnerships and stressed also that green economy debates had to pay attention to the care economy  giving support to unpaid care work through better infrastructure.  An enabling environment was needed to support the financing of pro-poor  gender responsive sustainable investments.  She stressed the need to build on the work of the Open Working Group  which had called for a standalone goal on gender. WENYAN YANG  Chief of the Social Perspective on Development Branch  Department of Economic and Social Affairs  said the report discussed progress and challenges to poverty eradication and presented policy considerations.  It also highlighted the activities of the United Nations system in the area and proposed a number of recommendations for consideration by the Assembly.  It found uneven progress in efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  with high unemployment a major impediment  especially for disadvantaged social groups.  It noted the threat to poverty posed by climate change and described recent progress made under the system-wide plan of action for the system-wide plan of action for the implementation of the second decade.  Adequate resources were needed to tackle the many dimensions of poverty.  Employment was a driver of inclusion and poverty eradication  while building resilience and tackling rising inequality was needed. KAZUKI KITAOKA  Coordinator for Strategic Planning in UNIDO  introduced the report of the UNIDO Director General on Industrial development cooperation  transmitted in a Note by the Secretary-General (document A/69/331).  The report analysed trends in industrial development  including manufacturing value added and growth in countries  policy issues related to industrial development  and the role of UNIDO in that area.  Industrialization had been seen as a major way forward towards eradicating poverty and advancing sustainable development.  Industry in developing countries remained a driver of growth and prosperity  and the link between inclusive and stable industrial development and long-term socioeconomic goals remained undeniable.  However  efforts must be made to ensure the inclusiveness of the benefits of industrial development and its environmental sustainability.  He also stressed that education policies must be revisited  as “we still see a mismatch between the skills offered and the needs of industry in many countries”. KAZI AFZALUR RAHMAN  Deputy Special Representative of UNWTO  introduced the report of the UNWTO Secretary-General on the Promotion of ecotourism for poverty eradication and environment protection (document A/69/223).  The report was cast in the broader frame of promotion of sustainable tourism for poverty eradication and environment protection.  That approach was consistent with the Rio+20 outcome document  in which sustainable tourism development was recognized as one of the sectors to drive change towards a green economy.  The report also included many good practices and positive experiences of practitioners  which showed that sustainable tourism was a significant driver of employment creation and environment protection.  The report should be considered in the backdrop of the growing importance of tourism in economies of countries  large and small  developed and developing  he said  with tourism representing 45 per cent of total service export in developing countries. Statements JULIO LÁZARO MOLLINEDO CLAROS (Bolivia)  speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 developing countries and China  expressed concern over the constraints on the fight against poverty posed by the global financial crisis  market volatility and food insecurity.  Developing countries needed national ownership of development agendas that focused on generating growth and employment  providing better access to basic services and social protection measures  and the empowerment of individuals to seize economic opportunities.  He pointed to slow growth in international trade and restrictions on access to development financing  noting that recent improvements in the global market were not enough to overcome imbalances built up in recent years.  ODA was vital but few developed countries fulfilled their commitments.  Industrialization was essential to generating productivity and jobs and he urged developed countries to assist developing countries  calling for technology transfer  technical assistance and financial resources. Women were an increasing proportion of the working poor and gender equality was of fundamental importance for achieving growth  poverty eradication and sustainable development  he said.  Investment in education of women and girls would have “multiplier effects in society” but women’s advancement  especially in developing countries  was impeded by widening inequalities  unemployment  violence and exploitation.  There was a need to promote gender in the post-2015 development agenda.  Stressing his commitment to equality rights and opportunities for women in political and economic decision-making and resource allocation  he added that women should have equal access to education  finance  information and communications technology and other essential opportunities. HENRY L. MAC DONALD (Suriname)  speaking on behalf of CARICOM and aligning himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  outlined baseline issues regarding poverty eradication in CARCIOM that the international community faced as it developed the post-2015 development agenda.  Those issues included relatively high poverty levels throughout the region; high income inequality; the emergence of new health threats; and inadequate housing solutions for low-income earners.  Progress in education had been achieved and most CARICOM countries  except for Haiti  had achieved high primary level enrolment rates.  Yet there were still low participation rates for males in secondary and tertiary education.  There were employment challenges as the region’s key export sectors  such as bananas  sugar  rice and manufacturing  became less competitive.  Therefore  an indispensable part of any regional strategy for development had to develop a more highly skilled workforce that was competitive internationally. CARICOM countries were particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change and the degradation of their ecosystems and adaptation measures had already placed an extra burden on the countries’ limited budgets  he said.  CARICOM looked forward to the speedy use of the Green Climate Fund and the agreement of a comprehensive climate agreement in Paris in 2015.  The United Nations needed to act as an advocate for CARICOM countries with international financing institutions to be sure they did not classify all CARICOM countries  expect for Haiti  as middle-income countries.  Policies should be implemented that advanced the creation of micro-  small- and medium-size enterprises.  Efficiently managed social protection schemes were compliments to other poverty-reduction efforts. The implementation of the post-2015 development agenda  including the sustainable development goals  provided the opportunity to help the hundreds of millions of people who would still be living in extreme poverty in 2015. KAREN TAN (Singapore)  speaking on behalf of ASEAN and associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  said more must be done to eradicate poverty  noting that  as of 2011  an estimated 18 per cent of the region’s population lived in extreme poverty  while an estimated 70 per cent of its poor lived in rural areas.  As urban poverty often had its roots in rural poverty  ASEAN’s framework action plan on rural development and poverty eradication prioritized six areas  including sustainable rural development and economic growth  food security and food sovereignty amid climate change  and social protection. She said community empowerment was essential for bringing development to rural areas.  A participatory approach involving communities  Government agencies  the private sector and others would ensure that programmes were relevant and holistic.  While underlining the contribution of non-governmental organizations to rural development  she said more could be achieved through partnerships.  Developed countries should fulfil their pledges to allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross national product (GNP) to ODA  and 0.15 to 0.20 per cent to least developed countries. Cooperation through regional institutions  in areas such as technology transfer  could also accelerate progress. CHARLES P. MSOSA (Malawi)  speaking on behalf of the African Group  noted that the end of the seventh year in the second United Nations Decade for Eradication of Poverty (2008-2017) was approaching and there were less than 500 days remaining before the target date of the Millennium Development Goals.  Yet  efforts to confront poverty and unemployment had not yielded optimal results due to a lack of progress in reaching millions of impoverished people in most developing countries  particularly in the least developed States and Africa. He urged the international community to accord priority to poverty eradication within the United Nations development agenda and donor countries to support developing countries’ national efforts.  Developed partners should also support the United Nations Social Protection Floor Initiative and scale up financial and technical assistance so that developing countries could set up social security mechanisms.  With women constituting a proportion of the working poor  gender equality was of fundamental importance for achieving sustained economic growth  poverty eradication and sustainable development. MATEO ESTREME (Argentina)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that Latin America was committed to ensure inclusive development of its populations  leading to  among others  better employment  food security and access  respect for cultural diversity  and social protection.  Social equity was only possible through a balanced and just economic development.  To eliminate poverty in the world  he called for a shared wealth between regions and populations who needed it most  and for a new global financial framework with a just representation of developing countries.  Work was the most efficient strategy for combatting poverty.  Speaking on women in development  he mentioned several measures taken by his country  including the introduction of a pregnancy allowance  and broadening of the rights of domestic workers. LAWRENCE XOLANI MALAWANE (South Africa)  associating himself with the African Group  and the Group of 77 and China  said poverty eradication was the greatest challenge facing the world.  “Both gender equality and sustainable development are crucial components for the fight to eradicate poverty”  he said  and neither could be attained without the other.  Any plans or actions aimed at eradicating poverty could not be successful if women did not have access to financial services  technology  quality health care  and land.  For inclusive and sustainable development to benefit all  several elements must be taken into account.  Firstly  industrial development was a national prerogative and countries should be given policy space.  Secondly  the adequate means for achieving sustainable industrial development were necessary.  Thirdly  the development of small and medium-sized enterprises was important to ensure inclusive industrial development.  Finally  industrialization must focus on the agricultural sector to prevent rural brain-drain. GUILHERME DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that halfway through the second decade for the eradication of poverty  the decrease in poverty rates had not been enough to reduce the number of individuals living in extreme poverty in developing countries.  Middle income countries should not be “graduated” against their will out of the United Nations system of funds  programmes and specialized agencies.  In his country  conditional cash transfers had provided macroeconomic policies with efficient and innovative tools to leverage employment and decent work as drivers of inclusive and sustained economic growth. RONIT BEN-DOR (Israel) called for a holistic response to the many dimensions of poverty.  Young people continued to be especially affected by unemployment and to remedy that  Israel invested in work opportunities by promoting entrepreneurship because it boosted confidence  skills and desire among people to solve problems around them “for themselves  by themselves”.  She described her country’s involvement in providing microloans to Arab-Israeli and Bedouin women in Israel to fuel their development.  Poverty was not just about low incomes but about a lack of opportunity.  The lack of access to food  education  sanitation and health care were also elements of poverty and Israel had social protection policies that added to poverty eradication  enhancing society’s resilience in the face of disasters and shocks.  Social safety nets were essential  particularly for women  who were less likely to have access to health  to own property or to have access to credit.  Pointing out that empowered women invested 90 per cent of their earnings back into their families  she said they must have “tools to be able to prosper”. GEIR O. PEDERSEN (Norway) said poverty had many faces and a majority of them belonged to women.  The exclusion that women and girls experienced from living in poverty was multiplied by the gender inequality they faced in their communities.  Important aspects of gender equality were left out of the Millennium Development Goals  and must be brought onto the new agenda for sustainable development through poverty eradication.  Women’s access to decent jobs  equal pay and equal sharing of domestic chores  equal rights to property  land and inheritance  and to participate fully in politics and the economy  were other important elements of that agenda that should figure prominently. GUSTAVO MEZA CUADRA (Peru)  speaking on behalf of the Group of Friends of Financial Inclusion  said financial inclusion was very important to end poverty and for other issues  such as industrial development cooperation and women in development.  Financial inclusion contributed to the achievement of numerous development outcomes and the Group welcomed the concept’s inclusion in the proposal made by the Open Working Group.  A target was included under the first sustainable development goal of the Working Group’s proposal  intended to eradicate poverty everywhere.  By 2030  all men and women  particularly the poor and vulnerable  should have an equal right to economic resources and access to financial services  including microfinance.  Without formal and inclusive financial services  families and individuals had to depend on incomplete  inadequate and inferior informal mechanisms to deal with economic disruptions and to build assets.  When people had access to a wide range of financial series  they were better able to make solid choices. JEAN-FRANCIS ZINSOU (Benin)  speaking on behalf of the Group of Least Developed Countries and associating with the Group of 77 and China  said the report was silent on an increase in those living in extreme poverty from 19 per cent between 1990 and 1995 to 30 per cent between 2005 and 2010.  The percentage of people living in poverty was a more significant figure than the actual number and 47 per cent lived below the poverty line in least developed countries  compared to 20 per cent in other developing countries.  Income levels  savings  investments and tax bases were comparatively small  making it hard for least developed countries to mobilize resources  while trends in poverty showed that problems were systemic in nature and needed addressing as such.  Least developed countries dealt with more challenges but had the smallest capacities and the United Nations should make it its “utmost priority to help them bridge the capacity gap”. The report “ignored the importance of the means of implementation for the eradication of poverty”  he said  calling for more systematic involvement of agencies  funds and programmes in support of national Governments.  The report did not call for enhanced international support for poverty eradication but more ODA was needed  as were greater investment  technology transfer and cancellation of debt.  The report lacked “the ambitious approach needed to foster the necessary drive” to achieve the objectives of the second decade for poverty eradication.  He noted that the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council were to include “issues of concern to the least developed countries” in their reports on social  economic and environmental issues.  Despite that provision  the current report did not.  It focused instead on other regions and categories of country  some which were not recognized by the United Nations  but part of the World Bank’s classification of countries based only on revenue.  The report should be a “tool of accountability” on mandates prescribed by the relevant resolution  not just a mirror to the overall situation in poverty. HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  ASEAN and the Group of Friends on Financial Inclusion  said his country had achieved sustained economic growth and substantial poverty reduction.  Poverty eradication programmes included the establishment of health clinics  affordable housing and welfare programmes.  Further  the eKasih system  a centralized national poverty data bank  could be accessed by all Government agencies for planning and monitoring programmes  while the rural development scheme was carrying out 20 000 “new generation” housing projects.  The 1AZAM programme focused on job placement  and the creation of small businesses  small services providers and agriculture opportunities.  Finally  skill training centres had been set up around the country to help thousands of young people. HUSSEIN ABDULLAHI (Nigeria)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the African Group  called for the reassessment and prioritization of financing for development  and greater efforts by donor countries to support effective national and regional poverty eradication and employment generation strategies.  Social protection as a right was a powerful instrument for poverty reduction and social cohesion.  It promoted sustainable economic and social development  and countries with social protection systems had been better able to cope with the global economic crisis.  The empowerment of women was also “another powerful mechanism to ensure poverty eradication as they constitute a large proportion of the working poor”  he said.  In recognition of their significant contributions to the economy and to combating poverty  his country had developed women-centred programmes to promote financial empowerment through skills acquisition  and a micro-credit programme focused on promoting skills in women and youth. JILL DERDERIAN (United States) said 90 per cent of extreme poverty reduction in the past decade was attributed to inclusive and sustained economic growth.  Yet every day  poor families made the most difficult choices between food  medicine housing or education  trade-offs with potentially catastrophic consequences.  Targeted policies  including social safety nets and social protection floors  as well as access to property and productive assess for men and women alike  were interventions that had succeeded everywhere.  A way forward for realizing what was once inconceivable was being charted amid rapid economic growth in many developing countries and new pathways being forged for information  expression and financial inclusion through mobile technology.  She advocated for new partnerships that promoted common interests  saying the United States was committed to working with all partners to leverage expertise and deliver results. AHMED SAREER (Maldives)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and with the Alliance of Small Island States  said that the post-2015 development agenda must flow from the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals.  In his country  several legal Acts aimed to ensure that vulnerable groups were not left behind when it came to poverty eradication.  Those Acts included a Pension Act and a Disabilities Act that secured an allowance for persons with disabilities  as well as social housing and other measures.  One could not talk of poverty alleviation without emphasizing the need to integrate climate resilience measures.  Any framework aiming to achieve the eradication of poverty needed to ensure that its measures  targets and goals were “climate proof”. NASREDDINE RIMOUCHE (Algeria)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and with the African Group  said that it was well established that poverty and social exclusion were a global phenomenon.  In many countries in Africa  poverty had reached alarming levels.  Countries did not have the means to combat hunger and malnutrition  and according to World Bank statistics  the number of people living in extreme poverty was greater than 1 billion.  Prospects for regrowth of employment seemed more sombre as more Governments were opting for budgetary austerity.  The burden of foreign debt  illnesses  and difficulties accessing markets in developed countries hindered national strategies for development.  The challenge demanded greater efforts from the international community.  The elimination of poverty had to be a priority in the post-2015 development agenda. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-20,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaab4124.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) today approved the United Nations priorities for biennium 2016-2017 and began its examination of conference services  including the late issuance of documents and the status of equal treatment of the six official languages.   At the outset  the Committee adopted  without a vote  a draft resolution on programme planning  by which the Secretary-General would be asked to prepare the budget proposal for the next biennium on the basis of the following priorities: promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development; maintenance of international peace and security; development of Africa; promotion of human rights; effective coordination of humanitarian assistance efforts; promotion of justice and international law; disarmament; and drug control  crime prevention and combating international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The Committee then commenced its consideration of issues related to conference management  including submission of documents  multilingualism  quality of translation and interpretation  cost efficiency  the utilization rate of meeting facilities  record digitization  paperless services and the development of common information technology systems  such as g-Meets  g-Doc and g-Text  to better manage conferences at the four United Nations duty stations -- New York  Geneva  Vienna and Nairobi. Tegegnework Gettu  Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly and Conference Management  noted impediments to improving meeting services included the ageing and retirement of skilled language staff  including interpreters and translators  and the “poaching” of those personnel by other international organizations.  On the late issuance of documents  he said that the problem could be better addressed if author departments submitted documents on time  improved the quality of drafts  abided by word limits  submitted documents in Word format and prioritized their work to fit the schedules of the Fifth Committee and the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ). Bolivia’s delegate  representing the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  stressed the need for an accountability mechanism to monitor the submission of documents  arguing that the most prominent issue was neither the overlap between the work of the Fifth Committee and ACABQ nor the lack of predictability in the Committee’s work programme  but the late submission of reports by author departments. The United States “would like to know why this continues to be a problem and what we can do to solve this collectively ” said its delegate  citing that the ACABQ’s report under consideration today was issued over the weekend.  She  however  commended the Department of General Assembly and Conference Management for reforming its services through the gDoc  gText and gMeets initiatives.   Japan’s delegate called for more in-depth discussion on the development and dissemination of PaperSmart technology across the United Nations on the premise that the system should help reduce conference service costs  while taking into account the need among Member States for hard copies.  It was vital to reduce all conference service costs  such as by planning fewer meetings and shortening their duration. The Russian Federation’s delegate urged the Secretariat to redouble efforts towards equal treatment of the Organization’s six official languages  calling for the establishment of a “centre” to promote multilingualism. The Committee also began its discussion on a proposal to make Yom Kippur  the holiest day of the Jewish faith  an official United Nations holiday.  Adding the “The Day of Atonement” to the United Nations calendar would send a strong message of tolerance  acceptance and unity to the global community  Israel’s delegate said. Yotam Goren  Chair of the Committee on Conferences  introduced the Report of the Committee on Conferences for 2014. Mr. Gettu introduced the Secretary-General’s report on the Pattern of conferences. Pavel Chernikov  ACABQ Vice-Chair  introduced that body’s related report. Also speaking today were representatives of Canada  Uruguay and the United Republic of Tanzania. The Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Monday  27 October  to take up agenda items on the United Nations pension system as well as the 2014-2015 programme budget for Umoja  the Organization’s enterprise resource planning system.  Programme Planning At the outset  the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) approved a draft resolution on programme planning (document A/C.5/69/L.4) without a vote. The text would have the General Assembly decide that the United Nations priorities for biennium 2016-2017 were: promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development; maintenance of international peace and security; development of Africa; promotion of human rights; effective coordination of humanitarian assistance efforts; promotion of justice and international law; disarmament; and drug control  crime prevention and combating international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.  Also by the text  the Secretary-General would be asked to prepare the proposed programme budget for that period on the basis of those priorities.  Pattern of Conferences YOTAM GOREN  Chair of the Committee on Conferences  introduced the Report of the Committee on Conferences for 2014 (document A/69/32) and highlighted the chapters and information contained in the 72-page report.  The Committee had held its substantive session from 2 to 8 September 2014.  The report included seven chapters  including Chapter II  Calendar of conference and meetings; Chapter III  Meetings management; Chapter V  Matters related to documentation and publications; and Chapter VI  Matters related to translation and interpretation. TEGEGNEWORK GETTU  Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly and Conference Management  introducing the Secretary-General’s report on the Pattern of conferences (documents A/69/120 & Corr.1)  described how the United Nations meeting management could be improved.  To improve the quality of services  it was important to reach out to managers individually.  For the Fifth Committee  document processing had been shortened from 30 days last year to 28 days this year.  However  there was no room for complacency.  Challenges facing the Department of General Assembly and Conference Management included the difficulty of handling workloads in peak periods and retaining skilled language staff  including interpreters and translators.  There was a need to hire temporary staff in peak periods. Experienced staff was ageing and retiring  and language staff was being poached from other organizations  such as the European Union and the World Bank  a situation that required the replenishment of language personnel  he said.  Lastly  he urged the relevant departments to submit documents in a timely way  improve the quality of drafts  abide by word limits  submit documents in Word format  and synchronize activity schedules with those of the Fifth Committee and the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ).  Many documents far exceeded word limits  and staff had to retype documents submitted in PDF format.  PAVEL CHERNIKOV  Vice-Chair of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions  introducing that body’s related report (document A/69/527)  said that the number of meeting rooms available and actual use of those at the four conference-servicing duty stations - New York  Geneva  Vienna and Nairobi - must be closely monitored  given a drop by three points from 85 per cent in 2011 to 82 per cent in 2013.  The Advisory Committee would keep the issue of multilingualism under close review and welcomed an effort to digitize the Organization’s documents. DAYANA ANGELA RIOS REQUENA (Bolivia)  speaking for the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  commended the Committee on Conferences for the high quality of its work and believed its recommendations would help the Fifth Committee’s consideration of this agenda item.  The draft resolution on the Pattern of Conferences was a good basis for negotiations on the issue.  The Group gave great importance to the effective delivery of quality conference services which provided equal treatment of the Organization’s six official languages.  As in previous years  the Group was concerned about the decline in use  from 80.5 per cent in 2012 to 67.4 percent in 2013  of the conference centre at the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA).  While acknowledging that the decrease was caused by the renovations carried out in 2013  the Group expected that the renovations  coupled with marketing and pricing strategy  would significantly improve the conference centre’s use. The timely issuance of quality documents was very important for the deliberations of intergovernmental bodies  especially the Fifth Committee  she said.  The Group noted that the Secretariat’s report highlighted two challenges in this area: the overlapping between the work of the Fifth Committee and ACABQ  and the lack of predictability of the Committee’s programme of work.  The Group disagreed with the assessment of the two issues as being the most prominent regarding the lateness of documents.  The Group believed that more attention had to be paid to what it considered the most prominent challenge: the issue of the late submission of reports by author departments.  The Group believed an accountability mechanism was needed to properly monitor and deal with this late submission issue.  “This would allow for a better understanding of all the different factors that affect the issuance of documentation ” she said. The Group welcomed the efforts of the Department of Public Information and the Department of General Assembly and Conference Management to digitalize important United Nations documents and hoped this single team had the capacity to digitalize the 3 million documents deemed as particularly important  she said.  The Group also stressed the importance of multilingualism and quality translation and interpretation services  in the six official languages  to the smooth deliberations of Member States.  The Group welcomed any action to improve the quality of translation and interpretation services and repeated that any efficiencies should not come at the expense of quality. HIROSHI ONUMA (Japan) said that while maintaining the appropriate quality of conference services was essential for proper decision-making  those services must be provided in the most efficient  effective way.  “The Secretariat should not stop seeking efficiencies in delivering conference services through the introduction of new cost-saving measures ” he said.  Japan wanted to deepen the discussion on the development and dissemination of PaperSmart throughout the United Nations  while accounting for Member States’ continuous need for hard copy documents and the premise that the use of PaperSmart should help reduce conference service costs.  Regarding the use of conference-servicing resources  Japan welcomed all initiatives introduced by the Secretariat to increase the usage rate of these services  but felt it was important to take more concrete and practical measures to reduce all conference service costs  such as by planning fewer meetings and shortening their duration.  He encouraged the efforts by all intergovernmental bodies to use digital recordings in order to boost efficiency and curb costs. MICHAEL DOUGLAS GRANT (Canada) said that his country had joined 32 Member States  representing more than 900 million people  from all five regional groups in submitting to the Committee of Conferences  a signed letter of support for the recognition of Yom Kippur as an official United Nations holiday.  Adding it to the United Nations calendar would send a strong message of tolerance  acceptance and unity from the Organization to the global community.  CHERITH A. NORMAN CHALET (United States) commended the Department of General Assembly and Conference Management for reforming its services and noted the tangible benefits of more efficiently processing and translating documents  through gDoc and gText  as well as meetings management through gMeets.  Those initiatives had not only improved the Department’s services  but had made the staff’s work easier and given it an ability to accomplish even more.  While commending the progress made on integrated global management across all United Nations duty stations  the United States noted that significant challenges remained in the timely submission of documents.  “My delegation would like to know why this continues to be a problem and what we can do to solve this collectively ” she said  adding that the problem lay with the Department of General Assembly and Conference Management’s processing  as well as the submitting departments and other bodies’ examination of reports.  For example  the delegation received the ACABQ report over the weekend for that issue  which was introduced at this morning’s meeting.  “This is not a responsible way to enable Member States to fulfil our oversight responsibilities ” she added. The United States also appreciated the willingness of the delegations on the Committee on Conferences to find a compromise on the request  made by several Member States  for the United Nations to establish Yom Kippur as an official United Nations holiday  she said.  Since the United Nations recognized the major festivals of other world religions  the United States believed the calendar should reflect the holiest day of Judaism.  Yet the addition of any holiday had to be completed on a cost-neutral basis.  She looked forward to exploring how establishing a Yom Kippur holiday could be done within these parameters. DAVID YITSHAK ROET (Israel) said many important issues were discussed during the Committee on Conferences’ last session and one issue in particular  the request to make Yom Kippur an official United Nations holiday  could extend the shared vision of tolerance and mutual respect.  Yom Kippur  or “The Day of Atonement”  was the holiest day of the Jewish faith  when millions of Jews living in 120 Member States fasted and spent the day contemplating how to advance peace and understanding between people.  The Permanent Representatives of 32 Member States  representing more than 900 million people from all five regional groups  had submitted a signed letter of support for the recognition of Yom Kippur as an official United Nations holiday to the Committee on Conferences.  That letter was officially circulated as document A/AC.172/2014/3.  “Adding Yom Kippur to the United Nations calendar will send a strong message of tolerance  acceptance and unity from the Committee to the global community ” he said.  The Israeli delegation looked forward to a robust debate in good faith on the technical aspects of the request  as well as the implementation process. IMELDA SMOLCIC (Uruguay) endorsed the statement made by Bolivia’s representative on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.  Speaking in its national capacity  Uruguay repeated its support for the inclusion of Yom Kippur on the list of United Nations holidays.  Religious holidays could be public or private and were collective expressions of people that went beyond borders.  They were holy and involved ritual and liturgy.  They could not be compared to other types of holidays.  They should be analysed and treated with respect and generosity.  Uruguay endorsed the request to recognize Yom Kippur as an official holiday.  It was committed to discuss the issue during informal consultations and hoped consensus could be achieved.  SERGEY V. KHALIZOV (Russian Federation) said the Secretariat must double its efforts to achieve parity of services in the six official languages  improve the quality of work and expedite document digitization.  Regarding the integrated global conference management services in New York  Geneva  Vienna and Nairobi  he stressed the importance of providing quality linguistic services  including training of language staff.  Measures to address the language capacity issue included hiring through competitive exams and internships.  The Secretariat’s effort to achieve equal treatment of the six official languages was not sufficient  and there was a need to improve multilingual translation services for treaty bodies.  The establishment of a single centre to promote multilingualism would merit consideration.  Lastly  he said that the practice of late presentation of documents to the Fifth Committee should not continue.   JUSTIN KISOKA (United Republic of Tanzania) aligned his country with the statement made by Bolivia’s representative on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.  It was necessary to invest in conference facilities and technology.  He urged the appropriate use of laptop computers during meetings.  Their use during previous meetings had been beneficial.  Any deliberations on PaperSmart should go along with improvements in technology.  That should be regarded as an investment  not just current expenditures.  With regard to impact of the Capital Master Plan  he emphasized the need to address certain elements.  That included the accessibility of some conference areas  including seating for handicapped delegates.  There was a need to invest in teleconferencing capabilities in all facilities. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-20,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gal3483.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Marking the 150th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions  speakers in today’s Sixth Committee (Legal) debate urged Member States to ratify the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and relating to the protection of victims of armed conflicts  with the aim of strengthening international humanitarian law. Switzerland’s representative pointed out that 150 years ago  the first Geneva Convention had enshrined the notion in international law that  even during times of war  a minimum of humanity must be preserved.  Since then  her Government and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had worked together to propel international humanitarian law onto the international stage. Two of their recent joint initiatives were being implemented  she said  the first on “Strengthening International Compliance with International Humanitarian Law”  focused on exploring the means to do so through consultations with States and other relevant actors  and the second through the Montreux Document on pertinent international legal obligations and good practices for States related to operations of private military and security companies during armed conflict. Urging States that had not yet done so to ratify the Additional Protocols and support the Montreux Document  she said that the two instruments completed the Geneva Conventions and improved the legal protection granted to civilians and the wounded. While many speakers echoed the need to ratify the Protocols  Qatar’s representative stressed that ratification was not enough  as demonstrated by current infractions of international humanitarian law in a number of the world’s regions.  The mechanisms adopted must also be implemented.  The International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission should be used along with other United Nations bodies  to help document and curb such infractions  he stressed  a stance taken by a number of other speakers. The representative of the United Kingdom concurred  stating that the Fact-Finding Commission had the potential “to help disperse the fog of war” by providing clarity about what had taken place in conflict.  However  it was regrettable that the Commission had not once been deployed since its formation.  Discussions were needed to consider ways it might be best used in the future. Concluding consideration of the United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching  Study  Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law  speakers continued to lament its lack of funding and to urge that resources be allocated to the Programme from the regular budget.  Portugal’s representative stated that providing the Programme regular budgetary resources for the 2016-2017 biennium would be a true contribution by the United Nations to the promotion of the rule of law. Also speaking on the Programme of Assistance were representatives of Tonga (for Pacific small island developing States)  Thailand  China  Guatemala  New Zealand  Qatar  France  Kenya  Trinidad and Tobago  Lebanon  Chile  Sierra Leone and Saudi Arabia. Other speakers on the Additional Protocols represented South Africa (speaking for the African Group)  Sweden (speaking for the Nordic Countries)  Costa Rica (speaking for the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC))  Russian Federation  Cuba  Egypt  Argentina  Peru  Australia  Israel and Monaco.  A representative of the European Union also spoke. The Sixth Committee (Legal) will next meet at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday 21 October to conclude its consideration of the status of the Additional Protocols  and to commence consideration of effective measures to enhance the protection  security and safety of diplomatic and consular missions and representatives  as well as to take up the Administration of Justice at the United Nations. Background The Sixth Committee met today to conclude its deliberations of the United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching  Study  Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law.  For background see Press Release GA/L/3482. It would then commence consideration of reports on the Status of the Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and relating to the protection of victims of armed conflicts (document A/69/184) and its addendum (document A/69/184/Add.1); and Consideration of effective measures to enhance the protection  security and safety of diplomatic and consular missions and representatives (document A/69/185) and its addendum (document A/69/185/Add.1). Statements TEVITA SUKA MANGISI (Tonga)  speaking on behalf of the twelve Pacific small island developing States represented at the United Nations  said their countries’ geographic remoteness  limited economies of scale  narrow resource base  susceptibility to the impacts of climate change  as well as sensitivity to severe disruption from natural disasters  was hindering their path towards sustainable development.  Notwithstanding those numerous challenges  their developing countries received great benefits in working in international law  especially from the regional courses in international law  the international fellowships  the Audiovisual Library of International Law  and publications.  In that regard  they were concerned about the continued insufficient funding and the lack of regular budgetary funding for the Programme of Assistance  and the resulting cancelation of the Regional Course for Asia-Pacific in 2014.  They welcomed the recommendations of the Advisory Committee  and urged Member States to take timely measures to include the Programme of Assistance in the Organization’s regular budget. KRAIJAKR THIRATAYAKINANT (Thailand)  associating himself with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  praised the Programme of Assistance and said that it would be regrettable if the Audiovisual Library would have to be cancelled due to lack of funding.  The Programme’s fellowship programmes had allowed successive generations of legal practitioners around the world to advance their knowledge  and the regional courses offered opportunities to lawyers for high quality training from renowned practitioners  and to share experiences with participants from different legal backgrounds.  Noting that Thailand had hosted a regional course for Asia and the Pacific in 2012  he expressed concern at the lack of regular budgetary funding for the Programme.  It was surprising that Member States could not agree on allocating a very small portion of the Organization’s budget to the Programme that all had applauded  he said. XIANG XIN (China)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  noted with regret that  due to lack of resources  regional courses in Asia and Latin America had been forced to be cancelled on several occasions.  It was unsustainable to conduct the regional courses and keep the Audiovisual Library going on voluntary contributions.  The cost of the Programme of Assistance should be included in the regular budget to solve the problem of insufficient resources.  Over the past few years  China had made annual donations of $30 000 to support the regional courses in international law in Asia and Africa and the Audiovisual Library. ANA CRISTINA RODRIGUEZ PINEDA (Guatemala)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China and the Community of Latin America and Caribbean States (CELAC)  noted the benefits her country had received from participation in the Programme of Assistance.  Given its limited resources  she expressed pleasure at its increased use of new technologies in spreading information on international law  but cautioned that countries must have access to that technology.  Financial resources were required to keep the Programme viable. In that context  she suggested consideration of a rotation of regional courses as a means to economize. ALEXANDRA LENNOX-MARWICK (New Zealand) said the regional courses provided an invaluable opportunity for young lawyers not only to receive high-quality training  but to do so alongside other lawyers from their region.  He recognized the willingness of Ethiopia  Thailand and Uruguay to host those courses  and expressed concern that the courses for the Asia-Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean were unable to go forward in the current year.  His country had consistently contributed to the Programme for many years.  However  voluntary contributions had proved inadequate.  He voiced hope that the consensus on the Programme’s importance would lead to a solution  and encouraged States to consider voluntary contributions to the Programme  alongside broader efforts.  In that light  New Zealand would make an additional voluntary contribution this year to both the regional courses and the Audiovisual Library. Mr. ALKHATER (Qatar) said the current situation faced by the international community showed the growing need for the Programme to reinforce international peace and security and promote respect among nations.  His country believed in the importance of international law  and enshrined it in its policy.  It had been keen on sending their legal experts to take part in training programmes  and had allowed legal professionals to participate in the Programme.  His country shared the concern of the Group of 77 and China regarding the cancelation of the regional course for Asia and the Pacific for 2013 because of budgetary constraints.  It was also of concern that another regional course had been cancelled for Latin America and the Caribbean.  He urged international institutions and donor countries to provide assistance to the Programme  to allow it to continue its training activities.  His country would continue to assist the Programme’s efforts in raising awareness of international law and promoting peace and security at the global level. BÉATRICE LE FRAPER DU HELLEN (France)  associating herself with the European Union Delegation  emphasized the political nature of the Programme  as it contributed to rule of law and maintaining peace and security.  At a time when General Assembly resolutions increasingly called for fighting radicalism and extremism  the Programme must be adequately financed.  She called upon Member States to provide those resources. JAMES N. WAWERU (Kenya)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the African Group  said that it had become clear that voluntary funding was unreliable  unsatisfactory  unpredictable  and disruptive  as demonstrated by the last minute cancellation of several regional courses and the uncertain future of the Audiovisual Library.  There was a critical and crucial need for a reliable and “pre-determined” mode of funding.  He joined those delegations in calling for budgetary funding for all activities under the Programme of Assistance from the regular budget of the United Nations. EDEN CHARLES (Trinidad and Tobago)  associating himself with CELAC and the Group of 77 and China  said that as a member of the Advisory Committee  his country had made voluntary contributions to the trust fund established by the General Assembly to assist the Codification Division in discharging its mandate.  Stressing that no programme could subsist solely on voluntary contributions  which was often dependent on the national budgets of Member States  he said that the current system undermined the effectiveness of the Programme  which was never designed to be funded primarily by voluntary contributions.  He underlined the need to secure funding from the regular budget  stating full support for the Advisory Committee’s recommendations to revisit the issue of funding for the Programme for the 2014-2015 biennium  particularly for the regional courses and the Audiovisual Library for 2015.  He also endorsed the Advisory Committee’s recommendations to request the Secretary-General to include additional resources under the proposed programme budget for the 2016-2017 biennium for the organization of regional courses in the three regions every year  and for the further development of the Audiovisual Library. YOUSSEF HITTI (Lebanon)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  noting that his delegation was a Member of the Programme’s Advisory Committee  said  “We deplore the financial issues which this Programme must grapple with and that threaten its future.”  That was not acceptable  particularly given the increased demand for regional courses and the increased use of the Audiovisual Library.  He suggested consideration be given to fully resourcing the Programme through the regular budget of the United Nations  while also exploring alternative means of funding. JAVIER GOROSTEGUI (Chile)  associating himself with CELAC and the Group of 77 and China  said that international law was an essential dimension to the rule of law  and should guide international relations among States.  He expressed regret that the administrative and financial fallout had impacted the Programme’s activities due to a lack of contributions from Member States  in particular the regional course in Uruguay  which had been cancelled.  His country had just contributed $10 000 towards that being picked up as soon as possible.  While voluntary contributions might improve the Programme  they could not be depended upon.  Noting that the Programme of Assistance in 2015 would be 50 years old  he said he would like to celebrate the anniversary with a stronger and revitalized Programme. JOÃO MIGUEL MADUREIRA (Portugal)  associating himself with the European Union  also noted his membership in the Programme’s Advisory Committee.  It had been widely recognized that running the Programme on voluntary contributions  as it was at present  was not sustainable.  The Sixth Committee had approved resolutions  requesting resources through the regular budget  that had been adopted by consensus in the General Assembly.  However  those resources had not materialized.  The Programme was at serious risk of ending.  The time had come to provide regular budgetary funding for the 2016-2017 biennium.  Such funding would be a true contribution by the United Nations to the promotion of the rule of law. AMADU KOROMA (Sierra Leone)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the African Group  said the relevance of the Programme of Assistance had not waned since it was first established by the General Assembly in 1965.  In light of today’s global peace and security challenges  the relevance of the Programme could not be over-emphasized.  He expressed appreciation to the Advisory Committee and the Codification Division for all their hard work and efforts  and underscored the importance of the Programme’s activities.  It was regrettable that  as a result of continuing financial difficulties  some of those could not be implemented  such as the regional courses in international law for Asia and the Pacific and for Latin America and the Caribbean.  He was concerned as well that there had been a significant decline in voluntary contributions for the Audiovisual Library  threatening the continuation of its activities in 2015.  Stressing the Programme’s need for a more reliable method of funding  he joined other delegations that had advocated for the activities of the Programme to come on the Organization’s regular budget.  As well  efforts should be made to encourage the private sector to support the activities of the Programme. Mr. ALBOGAMI (Saudi Arabia) expressed support for the efforts of the Group of 77 and China in its efforts to assist the Programme.  He stressed the importance of the regional courses and access to the Audiovisual Library in assisting the attorneys of his region.  He further expressed concern at the lack of financing from the regular budget for the Programme  calling for regular budgetary resources for the regional courses  the Programme’s technological resources and the Hamilton Shirley Amerisinghe Fellowship on the Law of the Sea. Statements on Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 THEMBILE JOYINI (South Africa)  speaking for the African Group  expressed concern that notwithstanding the existence of international humanitarian law as contained in the Geneva Conventions  the Additional Protocols  and customary international law  the rules continued to be flouted.  As there were many examples of violations  with civilians increasingly becoming the victims of war  it remained a challenge to the proponents of international humanitarian law to ensure global compliance to international humanitarian law and to protect the innocent.  In that regard  as the means and methods of armed conflict evolved  so must international humanitarian law. He said the way forward could be found in States’ adoption  ratification and codification in national laws of the various conventions and the 1977 protocols on the law of armed conflict  and in the implementation on the ground.  Just as Governments had the primary responsibility of assuring the safety and protection of their civilians at all times  national courts had the clear obligation to bring before the bench those accused of grave breaches of international humanitarian law and resulting national laws.  The United Nations should assist Member States  at their request  in the dissemination and effective domestication of international humanitarian law instruments.  It should also play a vital role in monitoring adherence to international humanitarian law during times of armed conflict.  A proactive approach of dissemination and education should be its primary focus  not a reactive approach where action was taken only after grave breaches of international humanitarian law had occurred. GILLES MARHIC  Delegation of the European Union  said that the promotion and respect of international humanitarian law was crucial to the protection of victims of armed conflict.  The Geneva Conventions enjoyed universal acceptance  and many provisions of the 1977 Additional Protocols were recognized as customary international humanitarian law.  Accountability was crucial to secure compliance.  There must be no climate of impunity  and victims of violations must be provided remedies in accordance with international humanitarian law.  Towards that end  the Union’s Strategic Framework’s Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy contained activities on compliance with the Additional Protocols.  During the reporting period  it had promoted dissemination and training in the field  and had conducted outreach towards ratification of Protocols I and II. He urged all Member States that had not yet done so to accede to all the additional Protocols  and to consider accepting the competence of the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission.  He also welcomed the ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty by 53 States  which would enable its entry into force in December of this year.  The International Committee of the Red Cross’ (ICRC) efforts to explore and identify means to strengthen the application of international humanitarian law was also welcomed.  The Union had also participated in the International Conference on the Montreux Document regarding the private military and security companies in December 2013.  He pointed out that the Union and its member States had provided the largest financial contribution to ICRC in 2013  including provisions for international humanitarian law training  and dissemination for military and security forces and armed non-State actors in key conflict affected countries. PERNILLA NILSSON (Sweden)  speaking also for Denmark  Finland  Iceland and Norway  said the protection of civilians must improve  notably by addressing the lack of respect for the agreed rules and principles of the existing legal framework.  She welcomed ongoing discussions for improving the situation of victims of armed conflict  especially the initiative by Switzerland and ICRC on enhancing compliance mechanisms.  The Security Council’s decision on the protection of humanitarian personnel was an important development  vis-à-vis improving conditions for those providing health care during armed conflict. On other matters  she said the Arms Trade Treaty would make a “considerable” contribution to the fight against uncontrolled trade in conventional weapons  noting that the Nordic countries had ratified or approved that accord.  She encouraged States that had not done so to do likewise.  Each State was obliged to investigate and prosecute serious violations of international humanitarian law  as solutions to the impunity gap must be found at the domestic level.  She called on States to engage in the process for strengthening compliance with international humanitarian law  so that the thirty-second International Red Cross and Red Crescent Conference would deliver strong results. GEORGINA GUILLEN-GRILLO (Costa Rica)  speaking on behalf of CELAC  called on countries that had not yet done so to provide the Secretary-General with information on domestic progress regarding the application and promotion of international humanitarian law.  States must ensure the application of such law in order to respond to new challenges  including armed conflict.  A key challenge was to ensure that combatants respected that law in situations where access to humanitarian assistance must be ensured. In addition  she said  it was crucial to respect the civilian character of non-combatants of civilian facilities  especially as Protocol I outlined that armed attacks should be limited to military objectives.  Encouraging States that had not done so to consider establishing a national commission to advise authorities on the implementation of international humanitarian law  she said such law must be integral to the training of armed forces  including those participating in peacekeeping operations.  She encouraged States to consider accepting the jurisdiction of the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission  calling on States parties to the Geneva Conventions that had not yet done so to become parties to the Additional Protocols. SERGEY A. LEONIDCHENKO (Russian Federation) said his country attached special significance to observing the Protocols Additional to the Geneva Convention of 1949 as a very important component of international humanitarian law.   Concerning the universalization of the Additional Protocols  he called on States  who had not yet done so  to consider that option as soon as possible.  He said that his country was genuinely interested in national experiences in implementation of international humanitarian law and initiatives in dissemination of knowledge in that very important area of international law.  It valued the special role of the International Committee of the Red Cross in protecting victims of armed conflict and in disseminating information on international humanitarian law.  Drawing attention to opportunities to use in armed conflict the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission established under paragraph 90 of Additional Protocol I  he said the obligation to observe norms of international humanitarian law lay first and foremost with States.  His country was continuing to adopt all positive measures to implement and disseminate information in additional provisions of international humanitarian law. TANIERIS DIEGUEZ LAO (Cuba)  associating herself with CELAC  said that civilian populations were increasingly becoming targets of abuse in areas of armed conflicts that resulted  among other things  from efforts by some towards political gains.  Such conflicts were the primary source of violations of international humanitarian law.  She opposed efforts by some to reinterpret those norms in order to weasel out of complying with them.  It was important to consolidate the regime relating to armed conflict  in order for it to be protected.  Political manipulation and double standards  under the pretext of protecting civilians or the responsibility to protect  weakened international humanitarian law.  States that fomented conflicts within other States for political ends must be held accountable.  Cuban national legislation had incorporated all necessary guarantees for compliance with those norms  especially on the protection of civilians.  Her country also had experience in disseminating and teaching international humanitarian law through a centre sponsored by ICRC and the Cuban Red Cross  and had made strides in introducing those concepts into the armed forces. DAMARIS CARNAL (Switzerland) noted that the first Geneva Convention came into existence 150 years ago  enshrining the notion in international law that even in times of war  a minimum of humanity must be preserved.  Her country and the International Committee on the Red Cross began working together to help propel international humanitarian law onto the international stage.  Such contributions were being continued through several joint initiatives.  The first  “Strengthening International Compliance with International Humanitarian Law”  aimed at exploring the means to do so through consultations with States and other relevant actors  based on resolution 1 of the thirty-first International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in late 2011.  Following final consultations in spring 2015  they would present  in a report  options and recommendations arising from those consultations.  He encouraged all States to actively participate.  A panel discussion on the matter would take place 28 October.  The second initiative was the Montreux Document on pertinent international legal obligations and good practices for States related to operations of private military and security companies during armed conflict  adopted in 2008.  The document was now supported by 50 States and three international organizations.  He encouraged States that had not yet done so to communicate their support for the document.  He further encouraged States that had not yet done so to ratify the Additional Protocols as soon as possible.  The two instruments completed the Geneva Conventions and improved the legal protection granted to civilians and the wounded. AMR ELHAMAMY (Egypt)  associating himself with the African Group  said his country attached importance to Protocol I  in particular  of the Geneva Convention.  It regretted breaches of international humanitarian law by Israel in the Gaza Strip  including its destruction of United Nations facilities  and called on Israel to comply with its obligations under international law.  He commended ICRC’s role in promoting and disseminating international humanitarian law  and encouraged its continued efforts in that regard.  He also called on Member States’ to comply with international humanitarian law and to intensify their efforts in raising awareness of it. NATALIA BABIO (Argentina)  associating herself with CELAC  said that in her country  humanitarian law had been incorporated into many law schools.  In addition  courses had been organized for the armed forces.  A national commission for the implementation of international humanitarian law monitored internal implementation  fostered dissemination of norms  and was in charge of the internal process for ratifying amendments to the Rome Statute.  More broadly  she said the Security Council should continue its engagement on the protection of civilians in armed conflict  while the General Assembly should continue to highlight the role of fact-finding.  States should consider accepting the competence of the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission.  She urged full compliance with obligations arising from the Hague Conventions  as well as the Geneva Conventions and the Protocols. ANGEL HORNA (Peru)  associating himself with CELAC  said his country’s Ministry of Justice had promoted the implementation of international humanitarian law through training activities.  His country also had a national commission on studying and applying international humanitarian law  which served as an advisory body to the Executive Branch.  That commission was also involved in limiting the effects of armed conflict and provided protection to those who did not participate or who had stopped participating in armed conflict.  The support and advice from ICRC had allowed that commission to have better results in its work.  His country was a party to most of treaties in international humanitarian law.  As a member of the Human Rights Council  it was rigorous in its compliance for the protection of human rights.  It had also adopted legal provisions in favour of women and vulnerable members of the population.  With regard to capacity-building  it had also made it compulsory to disseminate information on human rights and international humanitarian law at all levels of the educational system  be they civil or military.  With the support of the Red Cross  it had organized a number of activities to disseminate information and provide training on international humanitarian law for its central and local governments. ANASTASIA CARAYANIDES (Australia) welcomed progress towards the universalization of the Additional Protocols  strongly encouraging States that had not yet become parties to all three instruments to do so.  The protection of civilians and civilian medical personnel were two of the many binding rules on all armed conflict parties.  Australia had sought to use its time on the Security Council to promote compliance with international humanitarian law  including by reminding those parties of their obligations  and calling for greater accountability.  She encouraged States to recognize the competence of the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission  expressing hope that the Fourth Meeting of States would involve the identification of a possible compliance mechanism  to be presented for consideration at the thirty-second International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. YOUSEF SULTAN LARAM (Qatar) welcomed the decision by the State of Palestine to adhere to the Convention  and commended international recognition for the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols.  However  their ratification was not enough  as demonstrated by current infractions of international humanitarian law in a number of the world’s regions  and children and women were paying the price.  Mechanisms adopted must be implemented  he stressed.  The International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission should be used  along with other United Nations bodies  to help document and curb such infractions.  He welcomed the High-level Statement by the General Assembly and further welcomed ICRC efforts towards making the Fact-Finding Commission universal. JESSE CLARKE (United Kingdom)  associating himself with the European Union  said his country was deeply concerned that in recent years a number of humanitarian workers and medical personnel had been seemingly targeted and killed.  He urged all parties to armed conflict to abide by international humanitarian law and protect people  vehicles and buildings  bearing one of the protective emblems.  Voicing support for the current initiative  coordinated by ICRC and the Swiss Government  to strengthen mechanisms of compliance with international humanitarian law  he said that such efforts were essential to ensure that international humanitarian law remained relevant  and that issues of compliance were dealt with in appropriate international fora.  The International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission had the potential “to help disperse the fog of war” by providing clarity about what had taken place in conflict.  Stating regret that the Commission had not once been deployed since its formation  he urged all States parties to Additional Protocol I to recognize the Commission’s competence and to join in discussions to consider ways it might be best used in the future. MEITAL NIR-TAL (Israel) said that among a wide range of challenges facing the law of armed conflict  asymmetric warfare was particularly problematic  as it involved a State adhering to those laws facing a non-State entity that did not see itself as bound by them.  The law of armed conflict was premised on the distinction between civilians and combatants.  However  terrorists participating in asymmetric warfare intentionally placed themselves among civilian populations  using innocent people as human shields and abusing medical facilities and ambulances.  Such abhorrent practices had been part of her country’s reality for decades.  Noting that hers was not the only country with concerns regarding the Additional Protocols  she said Israel remained committed to the Geneva Conventions and customary international law  among other pertinent conventions to which it was party.  Further  Israel also demonstrated its ability to conduct thorough  credible and independent investigations into allegations of violations of that law.  Its Supreme Court opened its doors to any affected party  whether citizens or not  and including Palestinians  and its High Court of Justice had gained international recognitions for the delicate balance of its decisions between effectively fighting terrorism and the protection of human and civil rights.  Furthermore  the country also had intensified the legal training of its soldiers. ISABELLE PICCO (Monaco)  noting that the nature of conflicts had evolved since 1949 and 1977  said the majority of current conflicts was shaking up the rule of law and denying human rights.  She paid tribute to the Red Cross for its dedication and work to help victims of armed conflict.  Her country had deposited its ratification instruments to the four Geneva Conventions  among others.  She welcomed the work of the International Institute of Humanitarian Law in San Remo  and the courses it offered.  The Principality had established solid links with the Monaco Red Cross  and had cooperated fully to promote international humanitarian law.  On 21 October  Monaco would receive the President of the Red Cross  and take that opportunity to consolidate relations and to study areas for cooperation. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-20,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11572.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Sports could be a diplomatic bridge to peace and a vehicle for healing political and cultural rifts among communities  speakers told the General Assembly today as it reviewed progress in implementing its 2012 resolution on the potential of sport to be used as an educational and development tool. Assembly Vice President Gréta Gunnarsdóttir (Iceland) said that when nations and people got together to play sports  they cooperatively crossed political and cultural boundaries  even if there had been wars and enmity between them.  Examples abounded of sports supporting reconciliation and fostering peace among divided groups.   Introducing the Secretary-General’s report on the matter  she said that it cited the Organization’s initiatives to mainstream sport into social policies  from organizing football matches to raise awareness about anti-poverty programmes to encouraging athletes to speak out against discrimination. India’s representative said the United Nations recognition of sport as a fundamental human right was a step forward.  Azad Rahimov  Azerbaijan’s Minister for Youth and Sports  said international sporting events were an important tool for dialogue and tolerance among nations  and that sports events at home had helped promote health and development among his country’s youth.  Australia’s representative said physical activity could reduce harmful health problems and obesity  and that research had shown the value of sports for the development of children and adults with disabilities.  For its part  in the last five years his Government had committed $49 million for sports programmes in Australia and was working with neighbouring Pacific countries on grass-roots sports initiatives there.  Likewise  Ethiopia had made sports one of its overall development priorities  and was integrating sports programmes into national development and peace policies  according to its representative.   An example of the power of sport in conciliation and inclusiveness  said the representative of Qatar  was her country’s role in hosting the 2022 World Cup sponsored by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association  known as FIFA  which would mark the first time an Arab  Muslim and relatively small country would host such an important event. Tunisia’s representative said sports ethics should be taught to young people in schools and through associations and social organizations  so that sports arenas would not be used for expressions of xenophobia.  Israel’s representative  noting that Israeli athletes still had to contend with discrimination during international matches  echoed several speakers’ view that there was no room for racism in sports. Belarus’ representative called on the United Nations to take concrete steps to prevent the politicization of sports events.  The Permanent Observer for the International Olympic Committee expressed hope that Member States would unanimously support the Assembly’s annual “Olympic Truce” resolution calling for the cessation of all conflicts during the 2016 Games. Also speaking today were representatives of Monaco  Morocco  Russian Federation  United States  Brunei Darussalam  Brazil and Germany  as well as an observer for the State of Palestine. The General Assembly will meet again at 10 a.m. on 21 October to elect 15 members of the Human Rights Council. Statements GRÉTA GUNNARSDÓTTIR (Iceland)  Vice President of the General Assembly  introducing the report of the Secretary-General titled Sport for development and peace:  realizing the potential (document A/69/330)  noted that since 1993 the Assembly had recognized the virtues of sport as a means of promoting education  health  development and peace.  Those principles had been reaffirmed in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document  and in the 2010 Outcome documents of the Millennium Development Goals.  Sports had brought people together across cultural and political boundaries and fostered inclusiveness.  There had been many examples of the role of sport in creating bridges between divided communities  supporting reconciliation and fostering peace.  In the past 20 years  the United Nations and partners had committed to mainstreaming sport into social policies  such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) matches against poverty  and athletes speaking out against discrimination.  The report of the Secretary-General described many of those initiatives  and she looked forward to hearing Member views on how to further explore the contribution of sport to a more peaceful and prosperous world. AZAD RAHIMOV  Minister for Youth and Sports of Azerbaijan  said that sport was among the key factors in development  and could positively impact social inclusion.  That potential must be harnessed.  Welcoming the mainstreaming of sport in the development agenda  he noted that the collaborative efforts of all were of critical importance.  Policies and partnerships were a requirement for success at all levels.  His Government mainstreamed sport in its development strategies and his country had gained significant experience in organizing events.  The promotion of sport as a means of health and development was also part of Azerbaijan's policy on youth.  International sporting events were an important tool to bolster dialogue  understanding and tolerance among nations.  Sport had a unique power to bring people together  drive social change and bridge the gap between different ethnicities and traditions. MOHAMED KHALED KHIARI (Tunisia) said access to sport was a fundamental social right and a factor in social integration and development.  It promoted exemplary values and a robust education for children and young people.  He reiterated Tunisia's determination to continue to make sport a powerful tool for integration and development  tolerance and cultural diversity.  He welcomed the signing in April 2014 of the Memorandum of Understanding between the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee  which called for the strengthening of sports initiatives that aimed to encourage economic and social development.  Tunisia wanted the ethics of sports to be taught to young people in schools and through associations and social organizations  so that sports arenas and assemblies would not be used for racist slogans or expressions of xenophobia.  Tunisia would collaborate with all partners in promoting the values of sport. ISABELLE PICCO (Monaco) said that this year had seen two sporting events at a high level:  in the Russian Federation  the Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games  and in Brazil the World Cup.  The participation of United Nations bodies such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) had summarized the power of sport for dialogue and non-discrimination.  Sport  with its power to include everyone regardless of capabilities  was a force for good.  At a national level  a rally had been organized  which had brought together 400 students  testing their endurance as well as other skills.  Welcoming the naming of a new envoy for Youth  Refugees and Sport  she noted that this could encourage social inclusion within those damaged communities.  Sports could help give children access to a healthy lifestyle while promoting integration in the community. DAVID ROET (Israel)  a co-sponsor of the resolution on sport for development  recalled that just a few days after the conflict in Gaza had ended  Israeli and Palestinian children had come together to play soccer.  Jews  Arabs  Muslims and Christians had played together on Israel's national sports teams.  In Rwanda  thousands of cyclists  many riding bikes fashioned out of wood  delivered food  firewood and coffee.  The first Rwandan National Cycling Team  born in 2007  comprised Hutu and Tutsi riders who showed how sports united people and overcame ethnic and cultural differences.  But the memory of the dreadful day during the 1972 Olympic Games when Palestinian terrorists killed 11 Israeli athletes  and hostility took the place of international harmony was still fresh in his mind.  Israeli athletes today still had to contend with discrimination  he said  citing incidents in which Israeli tennis players were excluded from a Dubai tournament; athletes in Tunisia  Kuwait and Iran refused to participate in fencing and judo tournaments with Israelis; and one of Israel's soccer teams was attacked by a mob that stormed the field during a friendship match in Austria.  There was no room for any sort of prejudice  politics or racism in sport.  Member States should work together to cultivate a culture that “unites rather than divides us”. PETER STONE (Australia) said his country was well placed to use sport as a vehicle to contribute to targeted development outcomes.  Over the last five years  Australia had committed $49 million to development through sports programmes.  In partnership with Governments and non-governmental organizations  the Government had identified non-communicable disease prevention and enhancing the lives of people with disabilities as priority areas.  The Australian Sports Outreach Programme worked in seven Pacific countries to deliver grass-roots level sports initiatives.  Research demonstrated evidence of the value of sport as a development approach for people with disabilities and children.  Among his country’s efforts to combat non-communicable diseases through sport  research had shown the importance of getting women involved in community-based sports programmes  and that vegetable consumption had increased  and the consumption of tobacco  alcohol and sugary drinks had decreased. OMAR HILALE (Morocco) said his delegation had co-sponsored the draft resolution on sport and expressed hope that it would be adopted by the Assembly.  Since 2008  Morocco had drawn up a national policy on sport and development to anchor sport in the daily lives of its citizens.  It was a fundamental element in the development of young people  just as was education  training  political participation and access to the labour market.  Morocco was proud to be one of the few countries whose Constitution considered sport a human right.  He reiterated Morocco’s determination to reinforce the link between sports  international fraternity  friendship  and the unity among people.  There was no better way to encourage the values of respect  diversity and tolerance among communities  civilizations and cultures than through sports. PRAKASH GUPTA (India) said that sport was a catalyst that brought the international community together.  Sport was about participation and inclusion  and fostered skills such as discipline  confidence and leadership.  Quoting Mahatma Gandhi  he noted that when people played  they made mistakes  and it was through them that they learned.  The United Nations recognition of sport as a fundamental human right was a step forward; for his country  fostering a culture of healthy lifestyles was a national priority.  Yoga was a gift of India  and it was not about exercise  but about discovering oneness with self and nature  which could ultimately help deal with climate change.  Urging work towards the adoption of an international yoga day  he thanked the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for naming cricket star Sachin Tendulkar as ambassador for hygiene and sanitation in South-East Asia  a measure which would motivate children and young people across the region. Evgeniy ZAGAYNOV (Russian Federation) said sport could overcome national and international enmity.  At a time when we were witnessing greater tensions worldwide  it was more important than ever for the international community to foster sports as a means of solidarity.  His country noted the trend of using sports for exerting political pressure.  The international community would have to work harder to enhance sports.  The Russian Federation intended to continue to cooperate with its partners on sports.  The Sochi games popularized sports with a record broadcast audience and participation of more athletes than ever before.  Further  the Olympic area would later be transformed into a major winter sports training centre.  Olympic ideas would be promoted by an Olympic Sports University in his country.  The Russian Federation was ready to continue international sports cooperation  and would continue to organize major events at the highest possible levels. RUSSELL SINGER (United States) said that his country was home to a vast array of sporting events and communities.  The diversity and universality of participation in sports promoted inclusiveness  while bringing together people of all groups.  Sports crossed all segments of society  empowering people of diverse backgrounds while fostering tolerance and respect for all peoples.  Naming several national initiatives making use of sports as a tool for development and diplomacy  such as a sports visitors’ programme  he said that sport provided a universal language for educating people about respect  diversity and fairness  while combating all forms of discrimination. ABDUL GHAFAR ISMAIL (Brunei Darussalam) said his country encouraged everyone in society to take part in sports.  The country had hundreds of indoor and outdoor facilities  and children and youth were active in regional and international tournaments.  Females accounted for almost 60 per cent of national athletes.  Brunei's efforts towards inclusiveness were in the form of the national Plan of Acton on Persons with Special Needs; national sport events had included the rights of all people to participate.  On 6 April  Brunei organized a nationwide sporting event to inculcate the spirit and values of sports for all  equality  non-discrimination  fairness  integrity  tolerance  respect and mutual understanding.  They had ongoing programmes for youth  including a soccer football tournament that encouraged youth from Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to come together through sport.  A five-day National Youth Challenge brought together youth in team-building exercises  and Brunei had established two communications programmes wherein the Government accounted for the views of young people in the promotion of healthy lifestyles and sport. ERIKA ALMEIDA WATANABE PATRIOTA (Brazil)  a co-sponsor of the draft resolution  reaffirmed her country’s commitment to the principle that sport was a means to promote education  health  development and peace.  Brazil's Constitution recognized the practice of sport as a fundamental right  in line with the UNESCO International Charter of Physical Education and Sport.  Brazil was in the middle of a sports-centered decade  with the Confederations Cup in 2013  the Federation Internationale de Football (FIFA) World Cup in 2014  and the 2015 World Indigenous Games and 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games.  That was consistent with the priority Brazil accorded to sustainable development and social inclusiveness.  With FIFA Brazil had worked towards a World Cup that would convey the message  Say No to Racism.  During the opening of the 2012 Paralympic Games  Brazil signed a joint declaration with the United Kingdom  Russian Federation and the Republic of Korea in the promotion of human rights and values. MISHAEEL AL-HIJJI (Qatar) recognized the importance of sport in promoting physical and psychological health  enhancing social cohesion and solidarity  raising young people and in developing nations.  Qatar promoted sports at the national and international levels and as part of its international development policies.  Sports facilities were advanced and a means to promote sports in society.  The Qatar Olympic Committee had many important initiatives.  Qatar was a member of the Group of Friends of Sport for Development at the United Nations.  The Qatar Olympic Committee 2022 was playing an important role in hosting of FIFA in 2022.  It would be the first time an Arab  Muslim and relatively small country would host such an important event.  The Government had adopted national initiatives to expand the base of sports for all members of society  including a paid holiday for employees to benefit from sports. CHRISTIAN NELL (Germany) said that sport played a valuable role in contributing to social cohesiveness.  Sports programmes could foster social inclusion and help overcome discrimination on the basis of race  religion  disability  gender and gender identity.  Further  sports could help in the achievement of internationally agreed upon development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals.  Sport for development was important for national policies on development  he said  and while the focus of each programme varied from country to country  gender equality and peacebuilding was a common emphasis  among others.  The United Nations Office on Sports for Development and Peace (UNOSPS) played a key role in connecting people and promoting peace. HUDA MOHAMED (Ethiopia) said that sports were popular in her country  but such activities had not reached the desired level they all expected to achieve.  The Government had developed a comprehensive national sport policy and had put in place appropriate mechanisms to implement it.  Her State had further undertaken measures to help implement the national policy with the support and cooperation of relevant governmental organs and adopted various national declarations and resolutions.  Ethiopia had chosen sports as one of its overall development priorities  and had been working to further enhance its useful contributions by integrating it into national development and peace policies.  Her country called on partners and other stakeholders to continue to help Ethiopia’s institutions by providing financial  technical and logistical support for the development of sport programmes.  The country needed help from the United Nations and development partners in areas of capacity-building  provision of sports facilities and equipment and the promotion of community sports participation. Evgeny Lazarev (Belarus) said that in future reports like the one before the General Assembly today  his Delegation would call for concrete actions by the United Nations preventing negative manifestations  such as the politicization of the holding of sports events.  Sports were a tool for intercultural dialogue and understanding  and major international sports events often did more towards dispelling stereotypes and prejudices than political initiatives.  Congratulating the Russian Federation on their win at the 2014 ice hockey world championships  he said the occasion had underscored a simple truth  which was that the politicization of sports events served no purpose.  His Government intended to continue to back principles of neutrality and de-politicization of sports  as such politicization was incompatible with the principles of friendly relations. MARIO PESCANTE  Permanent Observer for the International Olympic Committee  said that with the Games  the Committee had been able to set an example of peaceful global interaction.  The past two years had witnessed important developments in leveraging that positive power year-round  in the strong partnership between the Committee and the United Nations  and in several joint agency and programme initiatives.  The Committee had been exploring ways to use sport more effectively as a tool for positive change.  In that regard  he urged Governments and stakeholders to increase access to safe and protected sports for all  in particular girls and women  people with disabilities  and marginalized communities.  The Committee had been supporting the World Health Organization's (WHO) Commission to End Childhood Obesity  and he encouraged others to promote sport for health and well-being.  Sports needed to be seriously considered in the post-2015 development agenda.  He hoped that the Member States would unanimously support the Olympic Truce Resolution urging an end to conflict in the context of the 2016 Games. Right of Reply Exercising the right of reply  an observer for the State of Palestine said that his delegation would have liked to be able to come to the General Assembly to take stock of progress made in the framework of sport and its role for good in terms of peace.  However  his delegation regretted that the Israeli occupation dominated all aspects of life.  The occupying Power hampered the development of sports infrastructure  as well as the movement of athletes  technicians  and visitors.  The organization of any sports activities involved a decision which was hostage to the vagaries of Israel's mood at the time.  In most cases  what was being attempted was to ensure the majority of sporting events did not happen.  He mentioned five children aged from nine to 11 who could have participated in sports activities  including with Israeli children.  However  he said  the occupying Power decided otherwise  and killed them while they were engaged in sports activities on the beaches of Gaza.  Israel destroyed all initiatives or means aimed at achieving development and peace in Palestine  and sports were no exception.  The events in Munich were an act that took place a single time  but Israeli massacres against the Palestinian people  including athletes  had gone on for 66 years.  Israel had broken records when it came to human rights violations  winning every gold medal in that category.  Israel would not put an end to its practices as long as the international community had not taken on its responsibilities in putting an end that country's practices. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-20,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gashc4106.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. With the Millennium Development Goals failing aboriginal peoples of the world  their knowledge and traditional practices must help to guide the post-2015 development agenda towards mapping a more inclusive  sustainable future  the Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) heard today  as it began its general discussion on their rights  a month after the historic first World Conference on Indigenous Peoples. While Member States had put significant effort into Millennium Development Goals  indigenous peoples had remained “largely invisible” in the process  according to Wu Hongbo  Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs and Coordinator of the Second International Decade of the World’s Indigenous People  in a statement delivered on his behalf by Thomas Gass  Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-agency Affairs  Department of Economic and Social Affairs. At the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples in September  the first one ever organized by the United Nations  Mr. Gass said the outcome document had requested the Secretary-General to include relevant information on indigenous peoples in the final Millennium Development Goals report.  “Although we have become better at talking about indigenous peoples ” he concluded  “there remains a major gap between words and actions.” Other high-level speakers and delegates came to similar conclusions during an interactive debate.  Invisible in national statistics  said Victoria Tauli-Corpuz  Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  they must be considered and involved in any decisions made that would affect them. Development strategies must take into account their languages  traditions  livelihood strategies and autonomous institutions  she said.  In contrast to the Millennium Goals  the proposed sustainable development goals presented a unique opportunity to address the inequalities suffered by the world’s indigenous peoples.  Their inclusion in discussions was essential  she urged. The United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Peoples had supported the participation of 105 indigenous peoples’ representatives at the World Conference  Maarit Kohinen Sheriff  Deputy Head of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in New York  told delegates as she delivered a statement on behalf of Ivan Šimonović  Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights. Given United Nations cooperation with indigenous peoples’ representatives regarding the World Conference  Finland’s speaker  during the ensuing general debate  called for their participation at the seventieth session of the General Assembly. Several Member States commended the World Conference as a historic achievement.  The representative of Nicaragua highlighted the open and inclusive dialogue that had resulted in the outcome document and said that the indigenous peoples had requested a development-based approach to human rights that respected their cultural identity.  According to Mexico’s representative  the World Conference and adoption of its outcome document reflected the maturity of Member States in recognizing the rights of indigenous peoples.  She called on the international community to ensure a cross-cutting inclusion of indigenous issues in the post-2015 agenda. Several delegates spoke about their country’s accomplishments in promoting indigenous people’s rights.  Colombia’s representative said that the legal and institutional framework in her country for those rights was recognized as one of the most advanced in the world.  Special political representation and collective land ownership were two examples of that.  Japan’s delegate noted that her Government had recognized the Ainu people as an indigenous community and was establishing a Symbolic Space for Ethnic Harmony in Hokkaido to revitalize Ainu culture. Looking ahead  the United States representative said her country was moving into a new era of partnership between the Government and indigenous peoples.  Overcoming the historic grievances about resources and territories was part of the process of reconciliation  she told the Committee. Also speaking today were representatives of Belize  speaking on behalf of Caribbean Community  Australia  Russian Federation  Cuba  Philippines  Panama  Suriname  China  South Africa  Guyana  Peru  Iran  Malaysia  Paraguay  New Zealand  Ecuador  Bolivia  Argentina  El Salvador  Congo  Tanzania  Brazil  Chile  Cameroon  Ukraine  Guatemala and Costa Rica  as well as the European Union and the Holy See. Officials representing the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Labour Organization also delivered statements. Exercising the right of reply  the representative of the Russian Federation also spoke. The Third Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Tuesday  21 October  when it is expected to begin its debate on the promotion and protection of human rights. Background The Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) met this morning to begin its consideration of the rights of indigenous people.  Before it were notes by the Secretary-General transmitting reports of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the Status of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Peoples (document A/69/278) and of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the rights of indigenous peoples (document A/69/267).  Also before the Committee was a report of the Secretary-General on the achievement of the goal and objectives of the Second International Decade of the World’s Indigenous People (document A/69/271). Interactive Debate THOMAS GASS  Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-agency Affairs  Department of Economic and Social Affairs  read out a statement by Wu Hongbo  Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs and Coordinator of the Second International Decade of the World’s Indigenous People.  Presenting the final report of the Secretary-General on the achievement of the goal and objectives of the Second Decade (document A/69/271)  Mr. Gass said that the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples had established a universal framework of minimum standards for the survival  dignity  well-being and rights of the world’s indigenous people.  While Member States had put significant effort into Millennium Development Goals  indigenous peoples had remained “largely invisible” in the process. It was vital  he went on  to recognize and strengthen indigenous peoples’ forms of governance and representatives in order to establish constructive dialogue with international and national authorities and to establish a United Nations-wide action plan to promote their rights in the five-year action agenda of the Secretary-General.  Recommending the establishment of a third international decade of the world’s indigenous peoples  he thanked Member States for their voluntary contributions to the Trust Fund on Indigenous Issues. In September  he added  the Organization had organized the first ever World Conference on Indigenous Peoples.  The outcome document had requested the Secretary-General to include relevant information on indigenous peoples in the final Millennium Development Goals report and to ensure a coherent approach to achieving the United Nations Declaration.  “Although we have become better at talking about indigenous peoples ” he concluded  “there remains a major gap between words and actions.” MAARIT KOHONEN SHERIFF  Deputy Head  OHCHR in New York  delivered a statement on behalf of Ivan Šimonović  Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights  introducing a note of the Secretary-General containing her Office’s report on the status of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Peoples (document A/69/278).  The report provided an update on the activities of the Fund and information on the expansion of its mandate.  It also called for constant and sustained financial support  among other things. She then turned to the expansion of the Fund’s mandate regarding the participation of indigenous peoples’ representatives in and preparation of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples.  The fund had supported 105 indigenous peoples’ representatives participating in the World Conference  she said.  It worked in close cooperation with the Indigenous Global Coordinating Committee for the selection of grantees  she added  and grants had been divided equally among seven indigenous regions.  The final selection of grantees rested with the Secretary-General  she noted.  Despite an increase in contributions in 2013 and 2014  the Fund called for $1.4 million for the 2014-2015 period so it could fulfil its mandate. In the ensuing interactive dialogue  the representative of Brazil made remarks on the need for disaggregated data  asking that close attention was paid in the post-2015 development agenda to the demands of indigenous peoples  to mainstreaming related policies and to fostering the promotion and protection of their human rights. VICTORIA TAULI-CORPUZ  Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  said that they had come a long way since the adoption of the Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention of 1957  (known as No. 107)  which was a first attempt to codify such international obligations of States.  Achievements included the landmark United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  adopted in 2007 by the General Assembly after more than 20 years of drafting and negotiations.  While States’ duties arose in integral elements in the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  she said the Declaration’s “remedial purpose” aimed at repairing the effects of the historic discrimination. Yet the international community had failed to use the Millennium Development Goals as a vehicle to overcome discrimination and achieve substantial equality for indigenous peoples.  In addition  while programmes that had maximized indigenous self-determination tended to perform better than State-controlled initiatives  the latter was still the standard scenario.  She hoped indigenous peoples would be participating in the processes of the OHCHR Working Group on the issues of human rights and transnational corporations  including the future open-ended intergovernmental working group to elaborate an international legally binding instrument to regulate those entities’ activities. Concerned about the invisibility of indigenous peoples within national statistics  she commended efforts of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean to establish a comprehensive database.  On development  she said strategies must also consider languages  traditions  livelihood strategies and autonomous institutions  and labour rights also needed to be protected. Underscoring the importance of consulting and involving indigenous peoples before adopting measures affecting them  she called on the United Nations Development Assistance Framework and the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to consider that in their assistance framework.  The universality of proposed sustainable development goals was a unique opportunity to address existing inequalities between indigenous and non-indigenous sectors and the process of defining  implementing and monitoring the objectives should be used to address indigenous peoples’ aspiration for self-determined development. During the interactive segment  Ms. Tauli-Corpuz responded to questions about the best ways to promote coordination between mechanisms working to promote indigenous peoples’ rights  saying the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples outcome document captured essential concerns.  Coordination was crucial to the achievement of many of the document’s proposals  including those relating to the lands  territories and resources.  On the post-2015 agenda  she said inter-agency support group meetings were effective in sharing tactics.  Expanding the mandate of the expert mechanism to include a monitoring role could also be useful. Continuing  she said there should be a common framework of agreed-upon goals  targets and indicators  with achievement of them ensured by the Organization’s bodies and agencies.  Aggregated data was key in identifying extreme poverty.  Providing a range of examples  she said “one country had managed declines in extreme poverty and had become the poster child for success”  but it had done so by driving away indigenous peoples from forests and providing subsidies to dominant peoples to move into those territories  a fact that never figured into the report because of a dearth of data on indigenous peoples. In other communities  such as in Guatemala  indigenous peoples did not go to hospitals because the hospitals had white walls and white uniforms  she said  noting that the colour represented death.  Therefore  the hospitals were painted in different colours to attract indigenous peoples.  Those kinds of intercultural approaches to State-sponsored social services were necessary  she said  encouraging countries to share best practices.  “We always focus on how bad the situation is ” she said  so the programme and practices that had succeeded in integrating indigenous peoples often got ignored.  A coordinated approach within the United Nations would be instrumental in highlighting what was already working so that more States could benefit from that  she concluded. IOANNIS VRAILAS  Deputy Head of the European Union delegation  said indigenous peoples had faced multiple forms of discrimination  not only because they were indigenous  but also because they were poor or female  because of their sexual orientation or their disabilities  calling for combatting discrimination in all its forms.  He welcomed the outcome document of the first World Conference on Indigenous Peoples and its focus on violence against women and children  among others  asking that the causes and consequences of that scourge be addressed.  He valued the contributions  traditions and knowledge of indigenous peoples had made to the world’s cultural heritage and paid tribute to the defenders of their rights  many of whom were often exposed to risk and repression. Turning to the European Union’s development cooperation  he said that support to indigenous peoples was a cross-cutting issue  as well as an objective.  Some of the European Union funding mechanisms specifically referred to organizations representing indigenous peoples as eligible beneficiaries  he added.  Noting the importance of related issues and the engagement of indigenous peoples in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda  he said that their respect and well-being were intertwined with the objectives of global sustainable development. KAI JÜRGEN MIKAEL SAUER (Finland)  speaking on behalf of the Nordic countries  said the promotion and protection of indigenous peoples’ human rights was a priority.  Fulfilling the objectives of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples outcome document needed a national  regional and global commitment.  Given United Nations cooperation with indigenous peoples’ representatives regarding the World Conference  he called for their participation at the seventieth session of the General Assembly.  At the regional level  he noted the presence of the Saami  the indigenous people of Scandinavia recognized and protected under the international conventions.  Turning to the post-2015 development agenda  he said it was crucial that related issues were respected  welcoming a human rights-based approach to development  supporting equalities and combating marginalization and discrimination.  LOIS MICHELE YOUNG (Belize)  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community  said the region had a solid history of peaceful coexistence in its diverse multicultural societies.  There was much to learn from the practices of indigenous peoples  he said  emphasizing that member countries had made important progress in ensuring their rights regarding equal representation in governance and decision-making regionally and nationally. Pointing out the gaps that kept the poorest in their societies marginalized behind barriers of geographical isolation  he noted that the Community had continued to improve access to quality health care and educational services in indigenous communities.  In that regard  he welcomed the adoption of the World Conference outcome document as it ensured States’ commitments to improve the well-being of indigenous populations  particularly women and youth.  Concluding  he reaffirmed his group’s commitment to the principles of equality and non-discrimination. TANISHA HEWANPOLA (Australia) said her country was deeply committed to the promotion and the protection of the rights of indigenous peoples  domestically and around the world.  Welcoming the success of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples and the adoption of the outcome document by consensus  she pointed out that the event was a critical step in advancing their rights.  Australia recognized the role of indigenous women and girls in the sustainable development of its communities  she said  adding that the Government had placed those issues at the centre of its reform agenda.  Underlining challenges facing indigenous peoples  she said Australia supported all efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence and discrimination against indigenous peoples  particularly women and children  youth  older persons and those with disabilities. DMITRY VOROBYEV (Russian Federation) said results had been achieved to promote the human rights of indigenous peoples  including by providing them with housing  education and health services.  The major task of States dealing with indigenous peoples’ issues was to establish conditions for their participation  he added  encouraging the transfer of knowledge to new generations  among other actions.  He appreciated the reports on indigenous peoples before the Committee  as well as the focus of the Special Rapporteur on their economic  social and environmental rights  especially the right to development.  He believed that the post-2015 agenda should take into account the interests of all societies  including indigenous peoples. JAIRO RODRÍGUEZ (Cuba)  noting the results achieved during the Second International Decade of the World's Indigenous People  called for additional efforts to achieve its five objectives.   He then urged the international community to recognize the right to self-determination as well as the right to enjoy their culture and traditions without discrimination or racism.  Despite positive achievements made in establishing human rights standards for indigenous peoples  he said they continued to face daily rights violations  including violence  forced relocation and the denial of access to their lands.  All cultures had a right to enjoy their human rights  including the chewing of coca leaves  he added. TERRI ROBL (United States) said that all stakeholders must consult and cooperate to make tangible improvements to the lives of indigenous peoples.  Her Government held regular consultations with tribal tribunals  during which indigenous participants had outlined several priorities for future United Nations actions.  One of the priority areas was collectively developing solutions for preventing violence against indigenous women and girls.  Such violence had devastating consequences on indigenous families and communities.  The United States welcomed the recommendation made in the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples outcome document that the Commission on the Status of Women should examine that issue.  Further  her country believed that the United Nations must monitor Member States’ progress in implementing the Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  The United States was engaged in a process of reconciliation between the Government and indigenous peoples because of significant historic grievances over resources and territories.  Her country was now looking forward to moving into a new era of partnership. ARINO YAGUCHI (Japan) said her country had steadily made efforts on the indigenous issues since the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  Recognizing the Ainu people as an indigenous community  the Government had set up an advisory council for a future policy  consisting of several high-level experts.  Also  Japan was working on two projects:  the establishment of the Symbolic Space for Ethnic Harmony in Hokkaido to revitalize Ainu culture and the promotion and protection of Ainu people residing outside of Hokkaido.  Concluding  she said her country was committed to tackling issues faced by indigenous peoples all around the world in cooperation with the United Nations. ELISA DIAZ GRAS (Mexico) said that the World Conference in September and the adoption of its outcome document reflected the maturity of Member States in recognizing the rights of indigenous peoples.  As the President of her country had said at the Conference  Mexico would continue to work to implement the outcome document.  Member States must work together to create a road map to meet the needs of indigenous peoples from various vantage points.  It was also vital to ensure a cross-cutting inclusion of indigenous issues in the post-2015 agenda and to develop mechanisms to guarantee their participation in the work of the United Nations.  Member States must seize the opportunity to align their national priorities with international agenda.  Her Government promoted a new approach to the rights of indigenous peoples that was based on respect and dialogue. MARÍA CLARISA GOLDRICK (Nicaragua) said that the outcome document was an important achievement that had resulted from open and inclusive dialogue.  Participating indigenous peoples had requested a development-based approach to human rights that respected their cultural identity.  Nicaragua also endorsed the “living well” concept that prevailed in Latin America and the Caribbean  which promoted intercultural relations and recognized the coexistence of communities with nature.  Nicaragua was proud of its indigenous and Afro-descendant roots  she said  welcoming their involvement in its public policies.  Further  indigenous peoples had a deeply rooted connection to land which went beyond material ownership.  Land was the habitat of their ancestors; therefore  their communal lands must be restored to them to allow historic continuity and to build cultural identity.  For its part  Nicaragua’s Mother Earth programme had given land titles to about 20 communities in Nicaragua. LIBRAN CABACTULAN (Philippines) said his country recognized indigenous peoples’ rights  including to self-determination and ancestral domains.  It also recognized relevant customary laws governing property rights and the requirement that free and prior informed consent should be obtained in relation to any development that had an impact on them  including for projects undertaken near or on their ancestral lands.  At the national level  a specific law envisioned an end of decades-long strife in Mindanao by establishing a political entity for the Bangsamoro peoples.  Turning to the post-2015 agenda  he said it could not overlook the needs and rights of indigenous peoples  as their full and effective participation was integral to the formulation and achievement of sustainable development goals. PAULINA FRANCESCHI (Panama) said 12 per cent of her country’s population was made of indigenous peoples.  National laws and legislation recognized respect for their rights and traditions  including the rights to land  she said  noting that five indigenous groups represented 28 per cent of national territory.  The Government recognized traditional authorities  traditions and customs  and conducted free and informed consultations before using indigenous lands.  Bilingual education was also provided  she added  noting that a vice ministry of indigenous affairs had been established.  Aware that much remained to be done  she said a dialogue to protect their natural resources had been initiated. CHANTAL LO A NJOE (Suriname) said indigenous peoples were an integral part of her country’s population.  Underlining that respect for cultural diversity and peaceful coexistence were distinct characteristics of society  she said that the Government had placed the recognition of the collective rights of indigenous and tribal peoples at the centre of its agenda.  In that regard  Suriname had actively participated in the lead-up to the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples  including in the negotiations surrounding the outcome document.  Concluding  she pointed out that discussions on the post-2015 agenda should include the progress of sustainable development policies and programmes with regard to indigenous peoples. MARÍA EMMA MEJÍA VÉLEZ (Colombia) said that her country’s constitution recognized the ethnic and cultural diversity of the entire nation.  According to a recent census  her country had an estimated 1.3 million indigenous individuals  reflecting an immense cultural and ancestral wealth.  The legal and institutional framework relating to indigenous people was recognized as one of the most advanced in the world.  Indigenous communities in Colombia had special political representation at different levels  their authorities were recognized and they had collective land ownership  which was managed by them in accordance with their ancestral customs.  Their languages were recognized as official in their territories and they had privileged spaces for holding discussions with the state.  Welcoming the World Conference  she added that it represented a historic contribution to the promotion of the rights of indigenous peoples worldwide. WANG HAO (China) said that indigenous peoples had made unique contributions to world culture  but historic reasons had led to their continued suffering  with their lands confiscated and their language and culture under attack.  Indigenous peoples also suffered from chronic poverty.  China believed that safeguarding their rights to development was a prerequisite for other rights.  Indigenous areas remained among the poorest areas in many counties  and poverty reduction and economic development was vital to improve access to a better life.  Countries must demonstrate the political will to implement the Declaration concerning their rights and the World Conference outcome document.  The concerns of indigenous peoples should be fully taken into account in the post-2015 agenda  which must also note the positive and unique cultural role that they could play in addressing climate change and sustainable development.  “Not all countries had indigenous peoples within their borders ” he added  noting that his country believed that a distinction must be made between native and indigenous peoples.  In closing  he said China stood ready to work with the international community to meet the legitimate demands of all indigenous peoples. TSHAMANO COMBRICK MILUBI (South Africa) said his country’s constitution recognized the rights of all its citizens without discrimination.  The Government had provided resources in the field of education  job creation and health care to promote and protect the rights of indigenous peoples.  In addition  free prior and informed consultations were held on issues related to them  he added  including fostering the participation of leaders in municipal councils.  Despite progress made  much needed to be done  he said  renewing his country’s commitment to working with indigenous peoples and with the international community to work toward the full promotion and protection of their rights.  In closing  he said it was every State’s responsibility to provide acceptable living standards of the people living within its borders. SHIRAZ ARIF MOHAMED (Guyana) said indigenous peoples’ rights were addressed in the constitution  including the right to protection  preservation and promulgation of their language  cultural heritage and way of life.  In relation to constructive dialogue and engagement with national authorities  he said it was important and fundamental to create an enabling environment to mainstream indigenous peoples’ goals and challenges in keeping with the principle of free prior and informed consent.  Challenges facing indigenous communities included their remoteness  posing difficulties for the delivery of certain social services  as well as unemployment and a lack of opportunities for economic advancement.  GUSTAVO MEZA-CUADRA (Peru) said that the World Conference had been a valuable opportunity to exchange information about challenges and best practices relating to indigenous peoples’ rights.  Peru’s 52 indigenous and native peoples had enhanced the country’s culture and identity.  A new law on that matter was a landmark in the relationship between the state and indigenous groups  he said  noting that in 2015  10 consultations on national policies would be held with indigenous peoples.  Another law had established indigenous languages as official in their territories and provided for 214 interpreters  he said  emphasizing that the “living voices” programme was encouraging the use of indigenous languages that were in danger of extinction as well as prioritizing land ownership.  The sustainable development goals under discussion must recognize indigenous peoples’ way of life and ancestral knowledge  he said  adding that Peru would work closely to recognize the rights of indigenous peoples in an open and inclusive manner. MOHAMMAD GHAEBI (Iran) said that there was a substantial gap between the recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples and actions on the ground.  The negotiation process leading to the World Conference outcome document was inclusive in nature and indigenous representatives had joined Member States in a spirit of cooperation and partnership.  Iran strongly believed that commitments made in good faith during the Conference must be backed up by actions  timelines and technical assistance.  Indigenous peoples were central to the discourse on sustainable development  he said.  The “dispossession” of land from indigenous peoples and the persistent violations of their rights had caused a great deal of deprivation and low standards of dignity and survival.  For its part  Iran emphasized the right of indigenous peoples to determine their priorities in exercising the right to development. HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia) said his Government had formulated and implemented programmes for the advancement and socioeconomic development of indigenous peoples.  Aiming at becoming a developed and a high-income nation by 2020  Malaysia ensured that all members of its multicultural and multifaceted society equally enjoyed the benefits of development.  Further  he recognized that indigenous groups were the most disadvantaged communities due to in part to their geographical location.  However  the Government provided an environment for indigenous peoples to equally participate in the national development agenda while preserving their culture and traditions.  Concluding  he said Malaysia would continue to work on advancing indigenous communities through close consultations with all stakeholders. MARCELO SCAPPINI (Paraguay) said that indigenous peoples represented more than 2 per cent of the population.  His was also the only country that had two official languages  one of which came from its original inhabitants.  A legal framework was present  he added  to ensure the protection of the rights of indigenous peoples  as well as to defend their community and its members.  The constitution had recognized the existence of indigenous peoples as cultural groups belonging to states of Paraguay  he said.  As such  authorities provided them with the right to land ownership in sufficient quality and size.  As vulnerable groups  they also received focused attention in national development plans aimed at combatting poverty and ensuring social inclusion  he said in closing. PHILLIP TAULA (New Zealand) said his country was pleased to give its full support to the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples  and the outcome document adopted by the General Assembly.  Noting that the document marked an important step in advancing indigenous rights  he called upon Member States to build on that momentum and follow up with practical steps towards implementing the commitments therein.  In that regard  New Zealand was committed to building and maintaining meaningful relationships with Māori in the areas of health  housing  education  economic development and justice.  Concluding  he said that the upcoming year would be critical to setting the post-2015 agenda  which should not leave indigenous peoples behind.  DIEGO ALONSO TITUAÑA MATANGO (Ecuador) said his Government had aimed at guaranteeing buen vivir  to live well  in the country by ensuring the welfare of all people.  In the Constitution  buen vivir was a reference to building up a society based on rights  including to water and sanitation  communication  culture  science  education  environment  health  and work and social security.  In that regard  he said  the Government paid great attention to cultural identity and ensured that the indigenous rights were not violated.  Underlining that the World Conference belonged to indigenous communities  he pointed out that the post-2015 development agenda would not be complete without considering their needs. BERNARDITO CLEOPAS AUZA  Permanent Observer of the Holy See  said fostering indigenous cultures did not mean going back to the past  but rather it was about their right to go forward  guided by their time-honoured collective values  such as respect for human life and dignity  representative decision-making processes and preservation of community rituals.  He then underlined that indigenous peoples had the same right to development  that it must be coherent and harmonious with their specific identity and values and that they must have a say about their own development.  He also highlighted the importance of just laws to regulate the relationship between indigenous peoples and extractive industries operating on ancestral lands.  SACHA SERGIO LLORENTTY SOLÍZ (Bolivia) said his country recognized different cultures as well as all the languages spoken alongside Spanish.  The Government  he continued  had been the first to incorporate the rights of indigenous peoples into its legislation.  They were recognized as historic elements and were encouraged to participate in all levels of society.  Parliament counted 32 per cent of its members as indigenous peoples  making it the highest ratio in the world.  Access to education  housing and infrastructure was also granted to them as well as spaces and funds that were created to foster their development.  In the health sector  the use of traditional medicine had also been allowed.  Turning to the issue of coca leaves  he said that they produced no harm to humans and called on the World Health Organization to conduct a study on that matter. MARÍA LUZ MELÓN (Argentina) said her country welcomed the World Conference outcome document  which respected the rights of indigenous peoples.  In line with its commitment to the World Conference  Argentina had taken legislative and political measures for the promotion and protection of cultural diversity and rights of indigenous communities  providing better visibility for them.  Further  she noted that her country was a party to the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 169  a legally binding international instrument which deals specifically with the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples  ratified by 20 States.  Stressing the progress achieved regarding recognizing and respecting indigenous rights  she concluded by calling upon Member States to fully comply with their commitments and to maintain the momentum gained since the World Conference. RUBÉN IGNACIO ZAMORA RIVAS (El Salvador) said his Government had actively participated in the World Conference  which was a roadmap for countries to advance indigenous rights and the implementation of the outcome document.  Welcoming the Secretary General’s report that reflected achievements and disparities  he noted that indigenous peoples could not be recognized as marginalized groups.  El Salvador had fully recognized the rights of indigenous peoples and had adopted policies relevant in protecting them.  Looking at the future with hope  he concluded by saying that challenges could be overcome through joint work and dialogue.  LAURIA NGUELE MAKOUELET (Congo) said the country had developed internal laws to promote and protect the rights of indigenous peoples  granting them the rights to health and education  among others.  New laws were also elaborated on the exploitation and valorization of the natural resources by the indigenous peoples.  She noted that the lifestyle and the practices of the indigenous people contributed to the forest ecosystem  calling for the mobilization of resources to invest in the development of infrastructures which benefitted them.  She also called on the development of economic  social and cultural programmes to promote effectively the rights of indigenous peoples  especially for women and the youth. NGUSEKELA NYERERE (United Republic of Tanzania) recognized a gap between the formal recognition of indigenous peoples and implementation of instruments on the ground.  The circumstance of indigenous peoples varied from region to region and from country to country  she noted  and implementation needed to take into account regional and national diversity.  Colonialism had brought with it marginalization and discrimination  she said  but immediately after independence the Constitution promoted and protected the rights of all its citizens  investing in their empowerment  including minority groups.  As an example  she mentioned the Masai population  whose culture was an integral part of the national identity. ANTONIO DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil) said over 800 000 Brazilians identified themselves as members of more than 300 indigenous peoples  speaking more than 270 languages.  The Government had made efforts to enforce the rights of indigenous peoples in domestic legislation  policies and concrete initiatives  he added  paying special attention to their traditional knowledge  medicines and practices  as well as their cultural and linguistic diversity.  The Government had also acknowledged the need to consult and cooperate with indigenous peoples in order to obtain their free  prior and informed consent with regards to their lands  territories and resources. CRISTIÁN BARROS MELET (Chile) said his country was committed to ensuring the rights of indigenous peoples  and it recognized the World Conference as a historic moment to prevent communities from lagging behind.  In that regard  he continued  the outcome document should be a road map for States in advancing indigenous rights.  Further  he noted that the Government had undertaken great efforts to strengthen indigenous rights  translating their commitments into actions.  Concluding  he called for practical steps towards ensuring the effective implementation of indigenous rights by all relevant stakeholders.  CÉCILE MBALLA EYENGA (Cameroon) said the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples was high on the agenda of the Government  as shown by the important step taken to identify the concerned groups.  She then welcomed the report of the Special Rapporteur  which identified the principle of self-identification as the main criteria for conducting a census of indigenous peoples.  National development plans had aimed at including indigenous peoples in matters concerning them and focused on areas including access to education and water.  Different realities in relation to indigenous peoples called for approaches that considered a variety of national contexts. VIKTORIYA LUCHKA (Ukraine) welcomed the outcome document of the World Conference as a framework for common efforts aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of indigenous peoples.  Indigenous peoples faced serious challenges in the process of preserving their identity and satisfying their social  economic and cultural needs.  “The occupation of Crimea by the Russian Federation has brought about the atmosphere of tension  aggression and intolerance in the territory of the peninsula ” she said  saying the Crimean Tatar community was undergoing the most severe suppression.  Russian authorities  disregarding them as the indigenous peoples of Crimea  were systematically abusing their civil  political and cultural rights  she said  urging the United Nations and its Member States to stand by their side as they suffered from repression and an ideology of hate and intolerance. MARÍA JOSÉ DEL ÁGUILA CASTILLO (Guatemala) said her country fully supported the World Conference and welcomed the outcome document adopted by the General Assembly.  Noting the progress made in fostering indigenous rights  customs and traditions  she said that Guatemala had developed a national public policy mechanism to eliminate racism and to live in harmony.  However  she stressed that there was more work to be done.  In conclusion  she reiterated her country’s commitment to ensuring full participation of indigenous peoples on the matters affecting them. ADRIANA RUÍN (Costa Rica) said the World Conference had positive results in advancing indigenous rights.  Despite progress  she continued  indigenous communities continued to face challenges  including ongoing matters regarding their rights and the integrity of their cultural identities.  For its part  Costa Rica had ratified the ILO Convention 169 and the Government had instituted a constitutional reform in line with the World Conference outcome document  incorporating the rights of indigenous peoples  and making progress in cultural diversity and non-discrimination.  LAUREN FLEJZOR  of the Food and Agricultural Organization  said its mandate was focused on the eradication of hunger  which could not be achieved without considering the special needs  rights and contributions of indigenous peoples.  Global recognition of how fundamental governance of tenure was to ensuring food security  she said  was reflected in its Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land  Fisheries and Forests.  They contained important provisions that recognized indigenous peoples’ rights and customary tenure systems and acknowledged the social  cultural and spiritual value that land  fisheries and forests had for them  she added.  Indigenous peoples’ ancestral knowledge encapsulated solutions related to climate change  natural resource management and a variety of sustainable development challenges  but their poverty and vulnerability called for specific attention  she said. KEVIN CASSIDY  of the International Labour Office  said the outcome of the World Conference provided a concrete road map for increasing efforts to strengthen the realization of the rights of more than 370 million people worldwide.  “Having a voice on issues directly affecting one’s future is the essence of decent work ” he said  calling for the outcome document to be included in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda.  Challenges facing indigenous people remained  including loss of land  access to natural resources and the impact of climate change  as well as income and employment insecurity and lack of access to education and vocational training. Right of Reply Exercising the right of reply  a representative of the Russian Federation said the Government of Ukraine had finally taken interest in the issue of indigenous peoples.  As for the Tatar community living in Crimea  he said that their participation had improved since the union with the Russian Federation  including that their language had been recognized. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-17,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gal3482.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. To guarantee the survival of its core components and key activities  the Programme of Assistance in the Teaching  Study  Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law must be funded through the Organization’s regular budget  delegates in the Sixth Committee (Legal) asserted today as deliberations on the matter began. Virginia Morris  Secretary of its Advisory Committee  pointed out that a decade ago the Programme had provided training for about 20 lawyers per year.  Today  it was training approximately one million lawyers annually.  Prior to the financial decline of 2008  the Office of Legal Affairs had been able to provide additional regular budget resources to support the Division’s increasing activities.  However  because regular budget resources were withdrawn in recent years  the Codification Division had increasingly faced difficulties in obtaining voluntary contributions for its Regional Courses and for the Audiovisual Library of International Law  threatening the survival of two of its key activities. The Regional Courses for Asia-Pacific for 2012 and 2013 had been cancelled due to lack of funds from the regular budget and voluntary contributions  she continued.  Noting that it had been a decade since a Regional Course for Latin America and the Caribbean was conducted  she said the course scheduled to take place in Uruguay this year had also been cancelled for the same reasons.  The Audiovisual Library  at relatively modest operating costs  had the unprecedented capacity to provide free high-quality international legal training to an unlimited number of users around the world.  However  $250 000 was required to ensure its continued work. Similarly  Ken Kanda (Ghana)  Chairman of the Advisory Committee  describing how the Programme had been established to assist developing countries emerge from colonialism  stressed the critical need to provide more reliable funding through the regular budget or voluntary contributions  primarily for regional courses and the Audiovisual Library.  Despite numerous General Assembly resolutions requesting funding through the regular budget  there had been no increase in the Programme’s budget for the current biennium  a situation the General Assembly was invited to reconsider for the current biennium. Costa Rica’s representative  on behalf of the Community of Latin America and Caribbean States (CELAC)  said that the Community had sent a letter to the Secretary-General in June this year requesting recommendations on a way to forward a sustainable solution.  The response letter had pointed out that specific language requesting funding to organize regional courses for Africa  Asia and Latin America must be included in the resolution.  Calling on delegations to support and approve the inclusion of such language this year  she said “the time for meaningful action by this Committee is now.” Uruguay’s representative recalled that it had now been a decade since regional courses had been held in Latin America and the Caribbean.  Despite the significant costs entailed  his country had offered to host a course this year. However  his Government later learned that the Secretary-General’s draft budget for 2014-15 did not include sufficient funds to develop the three regional courses.  The courses  excluding the Africa regional course  were subsequently cancelled  confirming that voluntary funding could not reliably sustain those activities.  The Africa regional course held in Ethiopia had proceeded because of a generous donation from Australia. A representative of the Russian Federation said it was unfortunate that although the Programme’s was essential to promoting the rule of law at the international level  it had simply been ignored.  Without funding  the Programme was at the brink of discontinuation.  As did many other delegations  she expressed support for the conclusions of the Advisory Committee and further welcomed the recommendation that Programme funding be shifted to the regular budget of the United Nations for the full implementation of its activities.  Pakistan’s representative  remarking that since 2008  over one million users — about 400 per day — had made use of the Audiovisual Library  emphasized that it was critical to provide sufficient funds for the Codification Division to implement its programmes.  Echoing many of his counterparts  he voiced hope that the Advisory Committee’s recommendations would receive positive results  making possible the dissemination and appreciation of international law.  Other speakers today were representatives of Bolivia (on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China)  Lao People’s Democratic Republic (on behalf of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN))  South Africa (on behalf of the African Group)  Sudan  Argentina  Ethiopia  Brazil  Malaysia  Australia  United Republic of Tanzania  Nigeria  Algeria  Belarus  Norway (also speaking for Iceland)  Sri Lanka  Ireland  and United States  as well as the European Union and the Division of Ocean Affairs and Law of the Sea (DOALOS). The Sixth Committee will meet at 10 a.m. on Monday  20 October  to conclude its debate on the Programme of Assistance and then take up the Status of the Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and relating to the protection of victims of armed conflicts; and Consideration of effective measures to enhance the protection  security and safety of diplomatic and consular missions and representatives. Background The Sixth Committee (Legal) had before it two documents:  Report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching  Study  Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law (document A/69/516) and Addendum to the Report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching  Study  Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law (document A/69/516/Add.1). Opening Remarks VIRGINIA MORRIS  Secretary of the Advisory Committee on the Programme of Assistance  said that while the General Assembly had approved activities to be conducted under the Programme for the current biennium 2014-2015 at its previous session  it had not provided any additional resources.  The Codification Division’s review of activities under the Programme of Assistance had resulted in a significant increase in international law training opportunities and research materials for the benefit of lawyers in every country of the world.  When the review process began a decade ago  the Programme had provided training for about 20 lawyers per year  she said.  Today  it was training about one million lawyers annually.  Before the financial decline in 2008  the Office of Legal Affairs had been able to provide additional regular budget resources to support the increasing activities of the Division.  However  those regular budget resources were withdrawn due to overall budget reductions for the Office of Legal Affairs in recent years  with the exception of one General Service level 7 (G-7) staff member who currently worked on the Division’s websites. In terms of its financial situation for 2014  she said the Division had lost two additional staff posts and had experienced difficulty obtaining voluntary contributions for the Regional Courses and Audiovisual Library.  While she had countless meetings with delegations from every regional group who had all expressed support for the Programme’s activities  the majority of them had indicated that their countries were not able to provide financial support for various reasons relating to their national laws and development aid programmes.  Consequently  she continued  voluntary contributions received this year had not adequately funded regional courses or the Audiovisual Library.  In terms of the financial situation for 2015  it was anticipated that the regular budget would provide sufficient resources for 20 fellowships for the International Law Fellowship Programme.  However  additional resources would be required in 2015 for regional courses in international law for Africa  Asia-Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean; the United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law; and desktop publishing. Turning to implementation of the Programme’s activities this year and plans for conducting those activities in 2015  she said the International Law Fellowship Programme had been a great success this year in terms of the distinguished lecturers  the broad curriculum  the extensive course materials and value of that training for participants in the performance of their professional responsibilities.  The regular budget had provided adequate funds to cover the cost of the course for 21 fellowship participants.  But  because of the reduction of Codification Division staff  voluntary contributions were used to pay for an additional lawyer to assist with planning and conducting the training course.  As the Division hoped to increase the number of fellowships from 20 to 30 participants  she encouraged additional voluntary contributions to offer more fellowships for the training course next year. On the Regional Courses in International Law  she said the Division could no longer afford to pay the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) to perform the administrative aspects of the Regional Courses as it had previously done.  The Programme needed necessary resources in funding and staff to perform those functions with respect to each of its training courses.  The Regional Course for Africa conducted this year  while successful  had been paid for by voluntary contributions due to limited regular budget funding.  Noting that the 2015 Regional Course for Africa still needed about $100 000 plus 13 per cent programme support costs  she made an urgent appeal for voluntary contributions. Furthermore  despite the generous support of Thailand  the Regional Courses for Asia-Pacific for 2012 and 2013 had been cancelled due to lack of funding from the regular budget and voluntary contributions  she said.  In addition  because of the lack of resources  the Division was not in a position to proceed with plans to conduct that course in 2015.  More so  it had not been able to conduct a Regional Course for Latin America and the Caribbean for the past decade.  The course scheduled to take place in Uruguay this year had been cancelled  due to lack of funding from the regular budget and voluntary contributions  despite generous support from the Government of Uruguay.  Also the result of a lack of resources  the Division was not in a position to proceed with plans to conduct the course in 2015. The Audiovisual Library of International Law had given the Organization the unprecedented capacity to provide  at a relatively modest cost  high quality international law training by leading scholars and practitioners from different regions and legal systems to an unlimited number of users around the world free of charge through the internet.  It had also recorded lectures by leading international legal scholars and practitioners  including five Presidents of the International Court of Justice  several members of the International Law Commission and a lecture earlier this week by the President of the Rwanda Tribunal on the legacy of that tribunal.  Highlighting that it was accessed by about 1 million users in all 193 Member States  she said most of the lawyers who used it were in developing countries.  Unfortunately  there was a distinct possibility that work on the Library would also have to be discontinued due to the lack of resources from the regular budget and voluntary contributions.  Noting that $250 000 was needed to ensure the continuation of the Audiovisual Library  she made an urgent appeal to Member States to generously support the Library. On legal publications  she said that the Codification Division  unfortunately  had discontinued its desktop publishing this year due to a lack of resources.  As it was anticipated that the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management would not issue any of those legal publications in the near future  there would consequently be a backlog in publication  as well as a loss of revenue for the Organization from publication sales.  Additional  regular budget finances would be required to resume desktop publishing in 2015 or the next biennium.  The Codification Division’s creation and maintenance of over 20 websites  funded by the regular budget  which contained information about the work of various legal bodies and publications had greatly increased the dissemination of relevant information and publications around the world. Turning to the Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe Fellowship  which was funded by voluntary contributions and required approximately $78 000  she said there was insufficient funding to make an award this year for implementation in 2015.  As the current balance was approximately $60 000  consideration was being given to ways in which a meaningful fellowship could be offered to public servants in the future.  Information concerning the implementation of the fellowship in 2015 would be provided in the Secretary-General’s report on the Programme of Assistance that would be submitted to the General Assembly at its next session. KEN KANDA (Ghana)  Chairman of the Advisory Committee on the United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching  Study  Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law  speaking also in his national capacity  laid out the Programme’s genesis.  Proposed by Ghana in the 1960s during the decolonization movement across three regions (Africa  Asia-Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean)  it aimed to provide international legal training by the most highly qualified international lawyers from different regions and legal systems  primarily for the benefit of lawyers in developing countries. However  over the past three years  the road had been difficult  primarily due to monetary issues  he underscored.  For that reason he had convened a series of informal briefings in 2013 and 2014  bringing together bankers and lawyers to address and resolve the Programme’s funding problems  particularly with regard to the regional courses and the Audiovisual Library.  Some of the Programme’s activities lacked resources  both in funding and staff.  Among the Advisory Committee’s recommendations was a need to provide more reliable funding for all Programme activities through the regular budget or voluntary contributions  primarily for the regional courses and the Audiovisual Library. He also noted that despite numerous Assembly resolutions to fund it through the regular budget  there had been no increase in the Programme’s budget for the current biennium.  That had not only prevented the implementation of some planned activities this year  but would also negatively impact others in 2015.  Therefore  the General Assembly was invited to reconsider the Programme’s funding for the current biennium. In addition  the Advisory Committee recommended that there be a specific request to include additional resources in the proposed 2016-2017 programme budget for the organization of regional courses each year and for further development of the Audiovisual Library  and that those requests also include funding for staff.  Another recommendation was to include in the regular budget the necessary funding for the Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe Memorial Fellowship on the Law of the Sea  should voluntary contributions be insufficient for granting at least one fellowship per year.  He expressed hope that the Sixth (Legal) and Fifth (Administrative and Budgetary) Committees would support those recommendations so that the fiftieth anniversary of the Programme next year would be celebrated with the knowledge its future was secure. Statements Mr. LLORENTTY SOLIZ (Bolivia)  speaking for the Group of 77 and China  said that at a time when strengthening the rule of law was on the international community’s agenda  the Programme of Assistance continued to be a critical tool for training lawyers  particularly Government officials  in international law.  Thus  the lack of regular budgetary funding for the Programme was of great concern  he said  noting the cancelation of regional courses  the possibility of the Audiovisual Library being discontinued and the lack of funding for the 2014 Amerasinghe Fellowship.  Already last year  the entire Programme was at risk  and in spite of the efforts made by the Group of 77 and China  Member States had not succeeded in taking the necessary measures to include the Programme of Assistance in the Organization’s regular budget.  Noting the Advisory Committee’s recommendations  he said it was for the Sixth Committee and the General Assembly  including its organs dealing with the budget  as well as the Fifth Committee  to continue on the path initiated by the Advisory Committee.  The Ministerial Declaration of the Foreign Ministers of the “G77” and China this past September had reiterated that there must be adequate financing for all aspects of the Programme through the United Nations regular budget for the biennium 2014-2015.  The Group was ready to take the necessary steps to operationalize the recommendations of the Advisory Committee  both at the Sixth and Fifth Committees.  He urged all Member States to join efforts in ensuring that the Advisory Committee’s recommendations were effectively implemented for the provision of regular budgetary funding to the Programme. KHIANE PHANSOURIVONG (Lao People’s Democratic Republic)  speaking for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  said that the Programme of Assistance  instrumental to promoting wider appreciation of international law among Member States  had significantly contributed to the strengthening of international peace and security and the development and enhancement of human rights protection at national  regional and international levels.  He singled out the Law Fellowship Programme  which provided the most comprehensive international legal training for lawyers from developing countries and emerging economies  while incorporating the use of advanced technology  in particular the Audiovisual Library  as a cost-effective and widely accessible tool to disseminate information.  He expressed hope that it would be expanded in the future. Noting that the organization of regional courses in international law in different regions of the world was the Programme’s main component  he welcomed the course planned for Addis Ababa  Ethiopia  in 2015.  He also voiced hope that previously cancelled courses would be reorganized in the Asia-Pacific region.  He urged Member States and other stakeholders to consider making voluntary contributions to the Programme.  The Programme’s precarious financial situation was of great concern and he reiterated that the whole budget for the regional courses and Audiovisual Library should come from the regular budget  as well as contributions from Member States.  In that context  he recalled the relevant General Assembly resolution requesting the provision of a budget to the Programme of Assistance for the 2014-2015 biennium. KINGSLEY MAMABOLO (South Africa)  speaking for the African Group  and expressing appreciation for the Programme’s work  particularly in regards to the development of international law in Africa  said that the African Union had made a decision in May 2013 to support funding of the Programme  including through the regular budget of the United Nations. He also commended the efforts of the Codification Division in organizing regional courses  stating that “the value of the regional courses are incalculable”.  However  he expressed concern over cancellation of the 2014 regional course for Asia-Pacific due to lack of funds  and failure to hold the course for Latin America and the Caribbean in 2014 for the same reason. “The Sixth Committee […] and the General Assembly have to deal with this matter of the funding of the Programme of Assistance head-on and build on the Advisory Committee’s recommendations ” he emphasized.  Those recommendations must be approved and funds from the regular budget provided to the Programme of Assistance. GEORGINA GUILLEN-GRILLO (Costa Rica)  speaking for Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  said that the Programme’s twenty-six international law-related websites  which were “remarkably user-friendly”  contained valuable resources and had potential to reach millions of people worldwide.  Furthermore  no effort should be spared to maintain an updated collection of the summaries and decisions of the International Court of Justice in all the official languages.  Bearing in mind that the working languages of the Court were English and French  the updated collection was the only means for countries in her region to access them. Financing was crucial to the implementation of those programmes  she stressed  noting that General Assembly resolutions 67/91 and 78/110 had specifically requested that for 2014-2015  resources necessary for the Programme of Assistance be provided to “ensure [its] continued effectiveness and further development […]  in particular the organization of the United Nations regional courses in International Law on a regular basis and the viability of the United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law.” However those resources had not been provided  she said  causing grave concern to her region.  Voluntary contributions were not a sustainable way to finance the courses  as demonstrated by the cancellation of two regional courses  despite the willingness of the host countries to provide 25 per cent of the financing.  “The time for meaningful action by this Committee is now ” she said. The Community  she said  had sent a letter to the Secretary-General in June of this year explaining the grave financial situation of the Programme and requesting recommendations on the way forward to a sustainable solution.  His response indicated that the language included in paragraph 7 of resolution 68/110 did not specifically request the Secretary-General to undertake additional activities not currently mandated.  Language must be included specifically requesting the organization of additional activities  inter alia  the regional courses for Africa  Asia and Latin America.  She requested delegations to support and approve the inclusion of the specific language needed in this year’s resolution. GILLES MARHIC  Delegation of the European Union  said the need for international law training and dissemination of legal knowledge and materials was a constant and the value-added of the Programme of Assistance was for the benefit of all States.  He reiterated strong support for the Programme and commended the Office of Legal Affairs  and the Codification Division  in particular  for its efforts to strengthen and revitalize activities under the Programme in order to meet the changing needs of the international legal community in the twenty-first century. He acknowledged the achievements of the Audiovisual Library of International Law  acknowledging the contributions of the International Court of Justice Registry  Hague Academy of International Law and Carnegie Foundation to the International Law Fellowship Programme.  He commended States that had provided voluntary contributions to the Programme to date and encouraged all States to consider making more frequent or increasing contributions in the future in order to sustain the projected regional courses and the Audiovisual Library.  He expressed hope that practical and sustainable financing solutions would soon be established. IDREES SAEED (Sudan)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  as well as the African Group  said the Programme of Assistance represented one of the most important aspects of the United Nations with regard to the rule of law  especially for developing countries.  It had increased awareness of the purposes of international law and promoted national coherence with international law  and the Audiovisual Library was beneficial to individuals and foundations.  He expressed concern about the financial difficulties that had caused the cancellation of regional courses in the Asia-Pacific and Latin American and Caribbean regions  and stressed the need to provide funding for those courses through the regular budget for the 2016-2017 biennium.  He commended the decision by the African Union to provide funding for the regional course in Africa.  As a Member of the Advisory Committee  he said its deliberations had been constructive and productive  noting his delegation’s robust participation.  He further recognized the high professionalism of the Codification Division  particularly of Virginia Morris and her team. ELENA MELIKBEKYAN (Russian Federation) said the Programme of Assistance was an important factor in promoting the rule of law at the international level.  Unfortunately  in recent years it had simply been ignored without justification.  Without funding  the Programme was at the brink of discontinuation.  As voluntary contributions had not proven to be a reliable source of funding to meet Programme needs  she said she agreed with the conclusions of the Advisory Committee.  She further welcomed the recommendation that Programme funding be shifted to the regular budget of the United Nations  with the expectation that such a change would resolve the problem of inadequate resources for the full implementation of its activities.  Finally  she noted the invaluable contributions made by the Office of Legal Affairs. FERNANDA MILLICAY (Argentina)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  as well as CELAC  said that taking into account the double objectives of disseminating international law in furtherance of the rule of law  and as a tool for capacity-building  particularly in developing countries  highlighted crucial aspects of the Programme’s work  including its publications and the Audiovisual Library  which were a priceless resource for Member States  public officials  lawyers  students and researchers.  Also  the Programme’s regional courses allowed participants to concentrate on topics of international law of current interest to the region.  Thus  the lack of funds that had led to the cancellation of those courses for the Asia-Pacific  and Latin American and Caribbean regions was cause for concern.  Lastly  its international law scholarship programmes were the most comprehensive for international lawyers.  She said that while Argentina believed that all the Programme’s activities should be funded through the regular budget  the Advisory Committee’s funding recommendations were “a step in the right direction”. YIDNEKACHEW GEBRE-MESKEL ZEWDU (Ethiopia)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  as well as the African Group  called upon the United Nations to organize regional courses in international law on a regular basis  stressing that such courses would give lawyers from developing and least developed countries the opportunity to grasp current developments in international law and promote cooperation among Member States.  His country had demonstrated its commitment in that regard by hosting the first  second  third and fourth United Nations Regional Courses in International Law for the African Region  which had been held in Addis Ababa.  Ethiopia would continue to host the Regional Course and collaborate with the United Nations in that endeavour.  He expressed appreciation for all Member States that had made voluntary contributions  particularly Australia  whose generous voluntary contribution enabled the regional course for Africa to be held this year. PATRICK LUNA (Brazil)  associating himself with CELAC  said it seemed paradoxical that as the debate on the rule of law gained prominence  funding decreased from the Organization’s regular budget for the Programme of Assistance.  The recent recommendations adopted by the Advisory Committee for the Programme was a clear step forward and his delegation welcomed the flexibility exercised in order to achieve consensus.  His country was committed to both ensuring that those recommendations were reflected in the resolution to be adopted in the Sixth Committee  and obtaining due approval by the Fifth Committee. HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia)  associating with the Group of 77 and China  as well as ASEAN  hailed the Programme as an “important building block” in the promotion of the rule of law  while the Audiovisual Library was a vital resource whose archives were a “window” into international law.  Noting that the International Law Fellowship Programme was also essential  he welcomed the holding of regional courses in Ethiopia from 7 April to 2 May  and urged that others be held in different regions.  The Programme should be funded through the regular budget.  Drawing attention to the Assembly resolutions that outlined the Secretary-General’s role in ensuring such funding  he called on States to ensure the Programme received the necessary resources for its activities. JULIA O’BRIEN (Australia) said that this year  Australia had made an unprecedented $150 000 contribution to the 2014 Regional Course for Africa  in which more than 30 participants shared experiences and exchanged ideas to facilitate understanding and cooperation on legal matters.  “It is clear that a world order based on the rule of law is key to strengthening international peace and security”  she said  voicing concern over a lack of funding for the Programme  and further  its potential impact on regional training courses.  While the funding model might need to be reviewed  she urged States to increase their voluntary contributions  as joint efforts would ensure that fellowships  courses and library services remained available to all institutions around the world. TULLY MWAIPOPO (United Republic of Tanzania)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  as well as the African Group  noted the continuing financial difficulties that had prevented the regional courses for the Asia-Pacific  and Latin American and Caribbean regions  and had impeded continued implementation of desktop publishing for legal publications.  Voluntary contributions alone had not been a sustainable means of funding the Programme’s activities.  More reliable funding was needed for all the Programme’s activities  without which the future of the entire Programme was threatened.  On a regional platform  she pointed out that the African Union had established the African Institute of International Law  located in her country  as an independent educational and research institution dedicated to the teaching  dissemination of and advanced research in international law of relevance to Africa.  The Institute had organized a training workshop on “bilateral investment treaties and arbitration” to be held in Arusha from 16 to 20 February 2015. ALVARO CERIANI (Uruguay)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  as well as CELAC  recalled that regional courses were not being held in Latin America and the Caribbean since 2004.  That situation had led his country to offer to hold such a course  although holding those courses in recent years had posed difficulties related to the host country agreement and funding.  Nevertheless  Uruguay had overcome those obstacles as it signed a diplomatic note to hold the course in May of this year.  It was informed that the host country should cover from 25 to 30 per cent of the cost and the United Nations would cover the rest. That was a significant sum for a developing country  he noted.  However  as Uruguay was committed to the Programme  with great effort it committed from $50 000 to $60 000 of its share to holding the regional course.  It had seemed that everything was on track to hold the course when his Government learned that the Secretary-General’s draft budget for 2014-15 did not have sufficient financial provisions to develop those three regional courses.  Under the Group of 77  he continued  Uruguay had proposed the introduction of a paragraph to be incorporated into a resolution in order to provide the necessary funds for holding the regional courses.  However  at the last minute  the text had not been adopted; the regional courses for Latin America and the Caribbean and for Asia-Pacific had to be immediately cancelled.  The Regional Course for Africa had survived due to a generous donation from Australia.  Such cancelations confirmed that voluntary funding could not reliably sustain those courses  for which funding must be incorporated from the Organization’s regular budget. Recalling the letter that CELAC had sent to the Secretary-General and the Under-Secretary-General for Management’s response that language in paragraph 7 of resolution 68/110 and previous ones had not been sufficient for allocating funds  he stressed the necessity of having text that clearly set out that those courses must be funded by the regular budget.  He expressed hope that the Sixth Committee would act in line with the Advisory Committee’s recommendations and adopt in its resolution this year the provision so that regional courses could be incorporated in the Organization’s regular budget and could be held in the biennium 2016-2017.  ADELEYE ELIAS-FATILE (Nigeria) said the Programme had been creating positive impacts on students and international law practitioners since 1965.  It was an instrument that fostered a deeper understanding of complex issues in an interconnected world.  Commending the Office of Legal Affairs and the Codification Division for their relentless efforts in implementing the Programme  he urged States to explore the possibility of an appropriate increase in financial support for the Programme through the regular budget. MOHAMED SELAH EDDINE BELAID (Algeria)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  as well as the African Group  shared the opinion that the Programme was an important tool for strengthening international peace and security and promoting a culture of peace and cooperation among States.  However  its achievements were constantly overshadowed by recurrent financial problems due to the inconsistency  insufficiency and irregularity of voluntary contributions.  He expressed concern about the cancellation of regional courses and the constant threats to continuity of the International Law Fellowship Programme  viability of the Audiovisual Library and existence of the Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe Memorial Fellowship on the Law of the Sea.  Voluntary contributions were inadequate.  Reliable funding for the Programme required compliance and implementation of General Assembly resolution 68/110  which requested the Secretary-General to provide the biennium 2014-2015 with the necessary resources to ensure the Programme’s continued effectiveness and further development. ILYA ADAMOV (Belarus) said his delegation was indebted to Virginia Morris for her tireless efforts on behalf of the Programme of Assistance.  The authority of international law did not depend only on the political interests of States.  Rather  international law’s strength rested on broad public understanding and knowledge of it.  In recent years  his country had had a number of seminars and courses at the international level on various legal issues and aspects of international law for a range of jurists and researchers in Belarus and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).  At the regional level  experts from the United Nations Secretariat and other international bodies had participated in seminars.  Such courses helped ensure the progressive development of international law  he pointed out.  However  organizing them in developing and middle-income countries posed constraints with respect to funding and voluntary contributions.  A system to provide assistance to the international community for such activities was needed.  Despite resounding declarations on the importance of upholding the rule of law and financing certain initiatives in that area  the Programme of Assistance  including the Audiovisual Library  continued to suffer from inadequate funding.  Consequently  the Programme’s ability to carry out its activities and ability to uphold the international rule of law continued to be negatively impacted. ANDREAS MOTZFELDT KRAVIK (Norway)  speaking also for Iceland  said the Programme recognized the value of mastering the complexities of international law and fundamental importance of making the most advanced and sophisticated international legal resources available to all.  Its Audiovisual Library had been accessed by some 862 000 computers in all 193 member States  and the number of applications for regional courses and fellowships was staggering.  That demonstrated and confirmed the demand for legal training and research materials in developing and developed countries.  Expressing concern that regional courses had been cancelled due to insufficient funding  he said it was clear that voluntary contributions were an unsustainable funding method.  The only way to guarantee adequate funding was to go through the regular budget.  In that light  he encouraged all Member States to ensure that the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to act accordingly. PALITHA KOHONA (Sri Lanka)  acknowledging the concern voiced among various delegations over a lack of funding for the Programme  said that the Audiovisual Library  which provided access to a “wealth” of international law-related material  and the Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe Memorial Fellowship on the Law of the Sea were also experiencing severe financial stress.  He encouraged State Parties to contribute to the Fellowship programme to ensure its continuation.  The Advisory Committee had recommended that additional funding be provided for the regional courses and Library under the 2016-17 biennium programme budget  he said  encouraging States to cooperate in the Sixth and Fifth Committees to ensure such recommendations were implemented. SAHEBZADA KHAN (Pakistan)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that while he appreciated the Programme’s efforts to utilize available resources  he expressed concern that insufficient funding had led to the cancellation of regional courses.  He noted further that  since 2008  over one million users  about 400 per day  had made use of the Audiovisual Library.  It was imperative to provide sufficient finances for the Codification Division to implement those programmes.  In that context  he expressed hope that the Advisory Committee’s recommendations would receive positive results  making possible the dissemination and appreciation of international law. JOHN ARBOGAST (United States) expressed appreciation for the creative ways in which the Codification Division had been able to keep important programmes going in the face of limited resources  and encouraged it to continue those “commendable efforts” to secure voluntary contributions to supplement programme budget resources.  “There is no question that the regional courses in international law  the Audiovisual Library and other Programme of Assistance activities are valuable and well-run  and worthy of support ” he said  expressing hope that “this very excellent Programme” would thrive for years to come. Ms. MORRIS  responding to questions and concerns from delegations  said that 30 participants had attended the Regional Course for Africa this year.  In terms of its profile  she noted participants were mainly from Ministries of Foreign Affairs.  The Course had also received applications from Ministries of Justice and Offices of the Attorney General.  On the profile of its lecturers  she said the Programme remained guided by the vision of the late Ambassador Dadzie of Ghana to give lawyers in developing countries the opportunity to learn from the most highly qualified lawyers from different regions and different legal systems.  She went on to say that core subjects  such as human rights  were covered.  Regional courses focused on legal aspects or issues that were of particular interest to a region.  Training courses were interactive  tough and demanding.  Students were expected to participate.  The goal was not only to convey knowledge but to promote understanding among lawyers in each region.  The Programme had a network of participants to facilitate contact as well as to disseminate information. ANNABETH ROSENBOOM  Division of Ocean Affairs and Law of the Sea  said the last candidate who had received the Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe Fellowship was a female lawyer from Sao Tome who was an officer in her country’s national petroleum agency.  She was currently participating in a nine-month program  commencing first with the Division before continuing on in Sweden.  She had been selected specifically because of the relevance of her research theme in security and environmental aspects of the Gulf region.  In response to a question concerning the Division’s efforts to ensure voluntary contributions  she expressed gratitude to Ireland  Monaco and Slovenia.  However  those were not sufficient  to support the fellowship for 2015.  The Division had made various calls on Member States for voluntary contributions through letters sent to all Permanent Missions in New York and during the various meetings serviced by the Director of the Division.  The Fellowship was also discussed during various bilateral meetings. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-17,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gadis3505.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The inability of the disarmament machinery to function had the “insidious effect” of stopping people from listening to each other  heard members of the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) during its thematic debate on the United Nations disarmament machinery. If the work of those forums was subverted by geopolitical power struggles  the security of all would be threatened  warned the representative of Canada. Pointing to discussions in the Conference on Disarmament on banning the production of fissile material  she said those exchanges had demonstrated that negotiations on a treaty should be within reach.  Unfortunately  that was not the conclusion reached by all States.  Framing the question of scope as an overly simplistic choice between an “all stocks” and a “no stocks” option was unnecessary and unhelpful  and had compromised negotiations  she said. The representative of Ecuador said either the international community could proceed with “improvised initiatives” that added uncertainty and mistrust  or try to correct the problem as a whole.  The proposals presented through drafts or other mechanisms  either in a “murky” or open way  tried to transfer the purposes of the Conference on Disarmament onto others.  The results were often incomplete  biased or lacking in certainty. The current machinery risked remaining “frozen in time” forever  he warned  stressing that while the international community needed to be imaginative when tackling issues related to disarmament  it also needed to be brave. Recognizing its unique responsibilities as a nuclear-weapon State  the representative of the United Kingdom said that the lack of movement in the disarmament machinery had not been used by his country as an excuse to stop taking steps towards disarmament.  His country remained committed to the goal of a world without nuclear weapons and had reduced its holdings. The representative of France made the point that “parallel initiatives” in the area of disarmament were incompatible with the Action Plan of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and could undermine it.  France was committed to the Conference on Disarmament for the three characteristics that made it irreplaceable:  expertise  participation  and consensus.  Importantly  the Conference had made substantial progress on each of the four core issues  which confirmed that a fissile material cut-off treaty was ripe  he added.  Agreeing that questions of disarmament should not be delegated to other entities  the representative of the Russian Federation said the issues required compromise and flexibility  as they touched on the national security of States.  There were no other entities at present  he said  to address those questions. In a joint statement with 20 countries  the representative of the Russian Federation said that tangible progress in multilateral disarmament could only be achieved within existing mechanisms.  As the single multilateral negotiating forum  the Conference could not be substituted by any other forum. The representative of China said that the stalemate in the Conference was the result of a lack of political will  and not its structure.  On that point  he said the principle of consensus should be preserved in disarmament matters.  That view was echoed by Turkey’s delegate  who said the problems that hampered progress in the Conference were not created by its procedures or internal dynamics. Sharing the perspective of a non-Conference member  the representative of Slovenia said that the issue of enlarging that body must be urgently addressed.  In his country’s view  new members would enrich the work of the Conference and contribute new ideas for its proceedings  he said. Similarly  the representative of Portugal noted that the Conference had not produced any decision regarding the enlargement of its membership in the past 15 years.  That  he said  was unacceptable. The representatives of Malaysia  Nepal and Peru introduced three draft resolutions on  respectively  the Report of the Conference on Disarmament  and the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific  and the Regional Centre for Peace  Disarmament and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean. Also speaking were the representatives of Indonesia on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  Egypt on behalf of the Arab Group  Suriname on behalf of the Union of South American Nations  Slovenia  Kuwait  Iraq  Netherlands  Kazakhstan  Lithuania  Cuba  South Africa  Spain  Senegal  Switzerland  Cameroon  Algeria  Republic of Korea  Czech Republic and Ethiopia. The Committee will meet next at 10 a.m. on Monday  20 October  when it will convene a thematic debate on nuclear weapons. Background The First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) met this afternoon to continue its thematic discussion on disarmament machinery.  For more background  see Press Release GA/DIS/3497. Statements DESRA PERCAYA (Indonesia)  speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  expressed concern over the erosion of multilateralism in the field of disarmament and arms control  and called on the Conference on Disarmament to agree on a balanced programme of work.  He encouraged all States to demonstrate the necessary political will for the Conference to fulfil its mandate.  To provide fresh impetus  he called for urgent work on a comprehensive convention on nuclear weapons that prevented their acquisition  transfer  use or threat of use and provided for their destruction.  He expressed regret that the United Nations Disarmament Commission  in addition  had not been able to make any progress since 2000 due to what he said was a lack of political will from some nuclear weapon States. Looking towards the next cycle of the Conference  he called upon Member States to exercise political will to agree on substantive outcomes.  The Movement stood ready to engage constructively on the disarmament agenda  and it supported the convening of a special session of the General Assembly to address the issues.  It was essential to ensure that the disarmament machinery would once again unleash its potential to advance peace and security for the entire world in the not too distant future. AMR FATHI ALJOWAILY (Egypt)  speaking on behalf of the Group of Arab States  and supporting the statement by the Non-Aligned Movement  welcomed the efforts of the Conference on Disarmament in 2014 under the Iraqi presidency.  The Conference should be the unique platform for discussing issues of disarmament; the fact that there was insufficient political will among Member States was a significant problem.  As the fissile material cut-off treaty was part of the global disarmament agenda  it must address the issue of stockpiling.  Expressing disappointment that no agreements had been reached by the Conference in past years  he underlined the need for consensus-building.  The Group of Arab States had shown political will and flexibility towards that purpose.  The Group hoped that more progress  taking into account the concerns of all States  would be achieved in the next sessions. NICOLE HEW A KEE (Suriname)  on behalf of the Union of South American Nations  said that efforts by the international community to promote peace and security were essential to a strong multilateral mechanism in the United Nations for disarmament and non-proliferation.  The Union believed that any attempt to reform the multilateral disarmament machinery should be done in a comprehensive manner.  She was deeply concerned at the failure of Member States in the Conference to accomplish an agreement on a programme of work  and she urged members to show the necessary political will to start negotiations. She called on the Conference to establish an ad hoc committee to start negotiations on a nuclear-weapon convention.  Another interim measure would be the negotiation of a multilateral and non-discriminatory treaty banning fissile material for nuclear weapons.  She noted with concern the possibility of an arms race in outer space and reaffirmed the need for a legal instrument in that field.  The Union also regretted the lack of progress in the Disarmament Commission on nuclear disarmament  as well as on confidence-building measures.  She urged Member States to exhort all efforts to allow the United Nations to make substantive disarmament recommendations.  Finally  the Union highlighted the work of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR). JEAN-HUGUES SIMON-MICHEL (France)  associating with the European Union  said he was committed to multilateral disarmament through a step-by-step approach.  He was concerned about parallel initiatives in the area of nuclear disarmament  which were incompatible with the 2010 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) Action Plan and could risk undermining it.  France was committed to the Conference on Disarmament.  Three characteristics made it irreplaceable:  expertise  participation of all States with key capabilities  and consensus.  The Conference had made substantial progress on each of the four core issues  which confirmed that a fissile material cut-off treaty was ripe.  The aim remained to begin negotiations in accordance with the priority set out by “action 15” of the NPT Action Plan.  He was looking forward to the report of the Group of Governmental Experts  which would contain essential elements to facilitate negotiations on a fissile material ban at the Conference.  He also highlighted the importance of the work done by UNIDIR and the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs.  Despite an unfavourable international context  disarmament and arms control had made progress in 2014  with the Arms Trade Treaty  consideration of lethal autonomous weapons systems  and the successful Maputo Review Conference of the Mine-Ban Convention. VLADIMIR YERMAKOV (Russian Federation)  speaking in his national capacity  said that it would be logical to examine the reasons behind the impasse  particularly in the Conference on Disarmament and the Disarmament Commission.  His delegation was of the view that the primary reason was the inefficiency of the work of the Member States and their delegations.  Disarmament required compromise and flexibility  as it touched upon the national security of States  and there were no other entities at present to address those questions  he said  underlining that the actual architecture of the Conference had been accepted by all.  Thus  questions of disarmament could not be delegated to other entities. The primary objective today  he went on  was to re-energise the mechanisms by presenting new ideas and reaching for consensus. Member States could and should contribution towards that goal  including by adopting  without vote  the resolution on the Report of the Conference on Disarmament. He also delivered a joint statement with Argentina  Armenia  Bangladesh  Belarus  China  Ethiopia  India  Indonesia  Iraq  Kazakhstan  Kenya  Myanmar  Pakistan  Syria  Tajikistan  Venezuela  Vietnam  Zimbabwe and Nicaragua.  He reaffirmed the group’s commitment to resume negotiations in the Conference without further delay.  Tangible progress in multilateral disarmament and in strengthening international arms control and non-proliferation regimes could only be achieved within the framework of the existing multilateral disarmament mechanisms  taking into due account the national security priorities of Member States.  The Conference  as the single multilateral negotiating forum  and with its fundamental principle of consensus and its membership  could not be substituted by any other forum for the purpose of addressing the complex issues on its agenda.  Voicing concern about the lack of progress on reaching consensus on a programme of work  the speaker called on States to demonstrate political will to resume substantive work on the core issues on the Conference agenda  namely nuclear disarmament  a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons  preventing an arms race in outer space  and assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.  Structured and results-oriented discussion should be encouraged pending adoption of a balanced and comprehensive programme of work. DATO MAZLAN MUHAMMAD (Malaysia)  also speaking in his capacity as the President of the Conference on Disarmament  introduced the draft resolution entitled “Report of the Conference on Disarmament” (document A/C.1/69/L.8).  He hoped it would be adopted without a vote as in the past.  The resolution was a fair and balanced reflection of the report  he said  noting that the focus remained the same as in previous texts  with technical updates.  He regretted  however  that the Conference had been unable to commence its work  but welcomed the decision to establish an informal working group.  He emphasized the importance of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR)  which represented engagement of civil society with the Conference on Disarmament.  Considering the Conference’s deadlock of more than a decade  the draft called on the body to intensify consultations with a view to the adoption and implementation of a balanced and comprehensive programme of work at the earliest possible date in 2015. ABDULAZIZ ALAJMI (KUWAIT)  associating with the Arab Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  renewed his support for multilateralism as the best way to promote the disarmament frameworks aimed at achieving international peace and security.  The Conference on Disarmament must guarantee the continued performance of the tasks entrusted to it.  He was concerned over the “chronic deadlock”  including the non-agreement on its agenda.  He welcomed  however  the proposal to appoint a special rapporteur to enhance the Conference’s membership  as that would enhance progress related to issues on its agenda.  It was nonetheless disappointing that the forum lacked the ability to reach consensus on the substantive issues. SARMAD MUWAFAQ MOHAMMED AL-TAIE (Iraq)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Arab Group  said the arms race was a major cause of tension and insecurity and would not lead to peace.  He stressed the importance of the Disarmament Commission  but acknowledged that the inertia overall in the disarmament machinery threatened international stability.  The Commission had not been able to adopt recommendations on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation  or on confidence-building measures.  He supported the contents of the principle paper submitted through the informal meeting held last month.  That could break the inertia that had inflicted the work of the Commission since 2000  and would auger well for its resumption.  Iraq attached special importance to the Conference on Disarmament  which had a record of successes.  However  it had been undergoing a critical period for more than 18 years.  Nuclear disarmament should remain among the Conference priorities  as the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons ran counter to international law. MATEJ MARN (Slovenia)  associating with the European Union  said that disarmament machinery was failing to respond to current challenges and was “constantly underperforming”.  Slovenia was also frustrated with the continued impasse in the Conference and regretted that  once again  it had not succeeded in commencing negotiations on international disarmament agreements  thus failing to fulfil its mandate.  The Conference should start negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty as soon as possible  he said  calling on all its Member States to take the necessary decisions.  At the same time  he said enlarging the Conference was “urgent” and called for a decision on that issue as soon as possible.  In Slovenia’s view  new members would enrich the work of the Conference and contribute new ideas for its proceedings  he said. HENK COR VAN DER KWAST (Netherlands) said a well-functioning disarmament machinery was required to resolutely and coherently deal with global security challenges amid growing public and political interest in disarmament.  The Conference on Disarmament saw some encouraging developments in its 2014 session  but was unable to agree on the resumption of substantive negotiations.  The United Nations Disarmament Commission had concluded another triennial cycle without agreeing to substantive recommendations.  Against that background  the Commission should have a more focused and results-oriented discussion on the agenda items.  Both the Conference and Commission would benefit from contributions of civil society.  He noted that the First Committee had received several draft resolutions rather late  which  he said  limited discussions.  The fact that 95 per cent of Member States — often including co-sponsors — did not provide follow-up reports on resolutions was not acceptable. WU JIAN JIAN (China) said that the Conference on Disarmament had successfully concluded treaties such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.  The Disarmament Commission also had made great contributions; however  the international community was concerned by the protracted lack of progress in both of those bodies.  The stalemate was caused by a lack of political will  and not by the structure.  The principle of consensus should be preserved in disarmament matters  as those related to the fundamental security issues of all countries.  Abandoning the existing disarmament machinery and creating new forums would not guarantee effectiveness or the universality of outcomes.  The international community should fully acknowledge the implication of international and regional security situations in the disarmament process  increase the level of mutual trust  and accommodate the legitimate security concerns of countries to create a favourable atmosphere for revitalizing the Conference and Commission.  China would continue to make contributions to that process. ANUAR TANALINOV (Kazakhstan) said that the increasing frustration of the international community over the Conference on Disarmament had been expressed “loud and clear”.  Analysis had shown that nuclear weapons were associated with the security perceptions of many States  whether they possessed those weapons or not.  Any disarmament forum  therefore  must be multilateral  and the Conference was at the heart of that process.  Kazakhstan urged members to make a concerted effort towards progress as a fully functional Conference was fundamental.  Also  the Conference must move beyond the first step of establishing an informal working group to taking action on other proposals  including one to establish a subsidiary organ  which would be critical to facilitating consensus-building. AIDAS SUNELAITIS (Lithuania)  associating with the European Union  reaffirmed the strong attachment to the multilateral approach to non-proliferation and disarmament.  The First Committee  the Conference on Disarmament  the Disarmament Commission and UNIDIR  as well as international treaties and regimes  were essential  mutually reinforcing elements of the United Nations disarmament machinery.  While some progress had been achieved in the Conference  it was disappointing that it had not succeeded in commencing substantive work.  That longstanding impasse had undermined its credibility  he said  noting that negotiations on the Mine-Ban Treaty  the Convention on Cluster Munitions and the Arms Trade Treaty had taken place “outside” it.  The need to enlarge the Conference had been pending for more than a decade; it should be addressed without delay. IVIAN DEL SOL DOMINGUEZ (Cuba) said that her country attached the highest priority to nuclear disarmament  and promoted multilateralism as the basis for those negotiations.  That was  she stressed  the only sustainable way to tackle international peace and security issues.  In that regard  the Conference was the only multilateral platform for negotiating treaties in that area.  While some claimed there were shortcomings in its operations  yet when political will was present  the Conference was capable of negotiating treaties  as in the past.  The Disarmament Commission’s shortcomings were not in the way of its work  as that body had made progress in the past.  Cuba supported the Non-Aligned Movement’s proposal for a comprehensive treaty on nuclear weapons  which she said would be the most effective and efficient path  as the international community must react urgently to the global call to eliminate those weapons.  Cuba supported efforts undertaken to optimize the disarmament machinery.  The lack of specific results was due to a lack of political will  particularly when it came to nuclear weapons. JOHANN KELLERMAN (South Africa) welcomed advances made in the past year to strengthen the international rule of law in the multilateral disarmament and international security environment.  However  the 18-year stalemate in the Conference was of particular concern.  The heart of the problem lay in the continued resistance by a small number of States to implement their disarmament obligations and to subject themselves to the international rule of law.  At the end of its three-year cycle in April  the Disarmament Commission had only been able to adopt a procedural report; discussions there were mostly long on procedure and short on substance. With each passing year  he said  it became clearer that the vast majority of Member States were exasperated with the lack of progress on nuclear disarmament.  In October 2013  125 countries had aligned themselves with a joint statement delivered by New Zealand on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons  and more than 145 countries had participated in a conference on that topic in Mexico.  He recognized the important role and contribution of civil society in the field of disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control  and hoped that interaction between Governments  civil society and academia would be enhanced. ANA PEÑA DOIG (Peru) submitted a draft resolution on the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace  Disarmament and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean  on behalf of the regional States.  She said that the Lima-based Centre had carried out projects in which it managed to destroy weapons and storage facilities.  It had also made a significant contribution to boosting the role of women in disarmament.  However  the Centre’s work was being conducted with scarce resources.  After recognizing the support from certain Member States and organizations  she called on all to step up contributions to allow the Centre to scale up its efforts.  That would help improve stability in her region to the benefit of all regions.  She counted on universal support for the draft. GHANA SHYAM LAMSAL (Nepal) said that regional disarmament mechanisms complemented the global agenda.  The United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific  in Kathmandu  was supporting peace and disarmament initiatives in Asia.  Continued regional dialogue among Member States in the region went a long way towards creating and sustaining a conducive environment for disarmament and non-proliferation.  Being a host country to the Centre  Nepal pledged commitment to provide all possible support.  He expressed appreciation to Member States that had contributed to the Centre and was confident that more would lend their support to expand and enrich its activities.  It was in that context that his delegation introduced a draft resolution entitled “United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific”.  He was confident it would be adopted by consensus. MARIA VICTORIA GONZÁLEZ ROMÁN (Spain)  associating with the European Union  stressed that non-proliferation efforts were as important as disarmament efforts.  They were different dimensions of the same process  and collective political will was needed to make progress on both fronts.  He reiterated Spain’s concern over the stalemate in the Conference and noted that the country had been active in discussing its reforms  including options to modulate the consensus rule.  The lack of progress was due to a lack of the political will to move forward decisively.  The Conference’s informal working group should meet next year to achieve its objective  as delayed negotiations on a fissile material ban should be resumed.  All negotiations on nuclear disarmament should involve the active participation of all States with nuclear weapons.  Without them  it was difficult to move forward in securing a nuclear-weapon-free world.  In the current context of a stalemate  all concrete proposals must be addressed with a constructive spirit.  It also must be ensured that any new proposals did not create additional costs. FODÉ SECK (Senegal) said that effective multilateral disarmament enabled conditions for a safer world.  However  the paralysis that had seized the disarmament machinery displayed its dysfunctionality.  A lack of political will was responsible  since those entities had all of the necessary elements.  That situation was frustrating  because the disarmament process must display strong political will in order to stop conflicts and disasters associated with weapons and related military facilities.  Consensus was a desirable means of decision- making  but other options should be explored.  Allowing certain parties  whose positions did not reflect those of the majority  was a trap and should be avoided  as that impeded achievement of a common decision.  It should be possible to find a solution within the Conference on Disarmament unless the General Assembly decided otherwise during a special session on revitalization and reform of the disarmament entities. KELLY ANDERSON (Canada) said neither of the two main multilateral forums established to advance disarmament had met the test of contributing substantially to international peace and security.  If the work of those forums was subverted by geopolitical power struggles  the security of all would be threatened.  The opportunity that the Informal Working Group offered to delegations to draft a consensus work programme  had been unable to generate significant cooperation  flexibility  and compromise to end the deadlock.  Canada was encouraged by the discussion  within the Conference  on banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.  That discussion demonstrated that positions were not so far apart  and that negotiations on a treaty should be within reach.  Unfortunately  that was not the conclusion reached by all States.  Framing the question of scope as an overly simplistic choice between an “all stocks” and a “no stocks” option was unnecessary and unhelpful.  Detailed technical assessment of the aspects of a treaty by the Group of Governmental Experts could “unpack” those questions  and contribute to eventual negotiations on the treaty itself.  However  the inability of the disarmament machinery to function had another  perhaps more insidious  effect in that people might have stopped listening to each other. URS SCHMID (Switzerland)  expressing concern at the paralysis  stressed the fundamental importance of a properly functioning Conference on Disarmament  capable of fulfilling its negotiating mandate.  Failure to break the deadlock would further damage its standing.  However  it was encouraging that the Conference was seeking to explore various options.  The 2014 session had led to substantive  intensive and high-quality exchanges which  in some instances  had clarified national positions.  The re-establishment of the informal working group tasked with producing a programme of work provided an opportunity for close examination of a number of considerations on which to build next year.  Establishing a structured process to consider the various aspects of working methods and functioning should be a priority for the 2015 Conference session.  The lack of progress in the Disarmament Commission was equally concerning  he said  of the view that it needed a more focused agenda. It was high time both forums opened up more fully to the contributions of civil society. MAMOUDOU MANA (Cameroon) said his country attached the highest importance to international peace and security  particularly in connection with disarmament  non-proliferation and the control of all weapons.  He welcomed the renewed engagement of some Member States in favour of total disarmament  but voiced concerns about the security situation in the Central African region  which had been confronted by wide-ranging conflicts  political crises  terrorism and lingering violence in post-conflict zones.  The circulation of arms was one of the biggest security threats in the subregion.  The situation in the Great Lakes Region  as well as the instability in the Central African Republic and Libya drew attention to the issue of small arms and light weapons.  In December 2011  countries in the region had adopted a road map on non-proliferation and combatting terrorism  followed by two workshops dedicated to evaluating progress. ÁLVARO MENDONÇA E MOURA (Portugal)  associating with the statement of the European Union  believed that a non-discriminatory approach remained essential to addressing concerns related to disarmament  arms control and non-proliferation.  Drawing attention to an issue of specific interest to his country  he recalled that for the past 15 years  the Conference on Disarmament had not produced any decision regarding its enlargement of its membership.  That situation was unacceptable.  Portugal regretted that no reference had been made in that body’s latest report regarding the nomination of the Friend of the Chair for enlarged membership. MATTHEW ROWLAND (United Kingdom)  associating with the European Union  said it was good to hear so many States reaffirm their support for the disarmament machinery and their willingness to revitalize and reinvigorate it.  His country joined that call  noting that for the machinery to be truly effective it needed to be revitalized.  All three bodies — the Disarmament Commission  the First Committee and the Conference on Disarmament — were mutually reinforcing  and reinvigoration of one would have a positive effect on the other. The United Kingdom recognized its particular responsibilities as a nuclear-weapon State  he said  adding that the lack of movement in the disarmament machinery had not been used by his country as an excuse to stop taking steps towards disarmament.  The United Kingdom remained committed to the goal of a world without nuclear weapons  and in the last five years  it had announced further reductions in warheads and it had revised and strengthened its negative security assurances.  It had reduced its holdings of nuclear weapons from around 460 warheads to a commitment now of 180 by the mid-2020s. BERNA KASNAKLI (Turkey) said the Conference on Disarmament  once a success story  had been dormant for too long.  The same  unfortunately  applied to the Disarmament Commission.  Multilateralism and progressive interactions among States carried sufficient ways of rectifying the ailments in the machinery.  In view of the multitude of security challenges  enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations disarmament machinery should be a shared objective.  The problems that hampered progress in the Conference were not created by its procedures or its internal dynamics.  There was a certain malaise throughout the disarmament machinery and the stalemate in the Conference reflected strategic bottlenecks at different yet interrelated levels.  There was an urgent need to formulate a consensual programme of work that would pave the way towards negotiations and revitalize the Conference  which possessed the mandate  rules of procedure and membership to discharge its duties. DJAMEL MOKTEFI (Algeria)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said it was important for Member States to demonstrate political will to revitalize the disarmament tools in an efficient and lasting way.  While each faced similar challenges  it was still the lack of political will that was the principle obstacle to achieving concrete results.  It was disappointing that the Disarmament Commission had failed to achieve progress  but he was confident that could be remedied.  He also continued to attach great importance to the Conference on Disarmament.  Given the critical weight of the issues on the Conference’s agenda  he was deeply concerned by the lack of consensus on a work programme.  That stalemate particularly affected those counties that did not have nuclear weapons. The consensus rule was a way of ensuring that all Member States  and not just the most powerful  could protect their national security interests. AHN YOUNG-JIP (Republic of Korea) said the Conference on Disarmament had been unable to complete substantive work for more than a decade.  The international community continued to urge that machinery to change  and for members to overcome the political problems creating that abysmal situation.  During the 2014 session  the Conference had established a working group to discuss possible options to creating a programme of work.  Those serious efforts demonstrated strong commitment to move forward.  The Shannon Mandate was a good basis for the fissile material cut-off treaty  but the Conference should not exclude other possible ways to boost its agenda items.  The working group was a very useful practice  he said  adding that such innovations could eventually lead to more common ground.  It was time for the international community to work together to revitalize the Disarmament Commission.  Member States should focus on common denominators rather than on differences.  He hoped the Commission would emerge from the prolonged impasse and once again play a unique role in disarmament and non-proliferation. FERNANDO LUQUE MÁRQUEZ (Ecuador)  associating with the Union of South American Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement  said  of the situation in the Conference  that either the international community could proceed with improvised initiatives  which only added uncertainty and mistrust to the process  or try to correct the problem as a whole.  The proposals presented through drafts or other mechanisms  either in a murky or open way  tried to transfer the Conference mandate to other forums.  Those were often incomplete  biased or lacking in certainty.  As far as he was concerned  it was clear that the stalemate in the Conference was due to a lack of political will on the part of the main actors.  Thus  progress would not be found by changing procedures or working methods  because without the necessary political will  the situation would only be repeated. He said that consensus in disarmament negotiations was based on the principle of security.  Innovative proposals had been made to try to further the prime areas of nuclear disarmament  namely  fissile material  preventing an outer space arms race  and providing negative security assurances.  He also called for negotiations to strengthen constraints on biological weapons.  He did not want the current machinery to remain frozen in time forever.  Rather  the rules and bodies should be respected until the international community convened a fourth special session of the General Assembly.  “Yes  let’s be imaginative ” he said. “But let’s also be brave.”  A special session would allow all United Nations members to reach a new consensus on the disarmament machinery and finally fulfil the promise that had been part of the United Nations since its founding. JIRI ELLINGER (Czech Republic) said that it was not feasible to launch negotiations without consensus on a programme of work for the Conference.  That was why the re-establishment of the informal working group to assist in its development was a positive step in the right direction.  Sufficient time and effort should be given to enlarging the Conference.  It would be appropriate to pay more attention to the rules of procedure as States considered that international stability and security was by definition a universal question that should be addressed by a universally represented body.  Furthermore  enlarging the Conference would promote transparency and inclusiveness of its work. BELACHEW GUJUBO GUTULO (Ethiopia)  associating with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  said multilateralism remained the most reliable and effective setting in which to comprehensively address critical global issues of international peace and security  including disarmament.  As nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction continued to challenge peace and security  revitalizing international disarmament machineries  particularly the Conference on Disarmament  became urgent.  Political will of individual States  particularly those that possessed nuclear weapons  was vital.  The perceived or real threat of their use and that of other mass destruction weapons by non-State actors was a source of great concern.  The only safe alternative was the total elimination of those weapons through multilateral and bilateral negotiations.  It was important  therefore  to enable the Conference to begin its work in a substantive and progressive way. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-17,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gashc4105.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Violence against society’s most vulnerable  in all its forms  needed to be uprooted and eradicated in order to pave a sure path towards sustainable development  the Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) heard today as it continued its debate on the rights of children  and concluded its consideration of the advancement of women. On the eve of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child  many of the more than 50 delegates said that although the instrument had been signed by all United Nations Member States  children still faced violence every day.  The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reported that each year between 500 million and 1.5 billion children experienced violence  including all forms of physical or mental violence  one speaker told the Committee. With an opportunity to reflect on progress achieved and challenges remaining in protecting children  many speakers drew attention to ending violence against children as a major challenge.  Action was needed  many speakers implored  in conflict-affected areas  online  and on local to global levels. Several delegates underlined a grim reality of the increasing use and targeting of children in conflict situations.  In recent years  3 million children had been killed in armed conflicts and the recruitment of child soldiers persisted  said the Permanent Observer of Mission of the Holy See. Expressing support for the “Children  Not Soldiers” campaign  some speakers were concerned about the recruitment and use of children in armed conflicts  as it was prevalent in many parts of the world.  Emphasizing the importance of the matter  Malaysia’s delegate said children and armed conflict would be a priority area for his country  as Malaysia was elected yesterday as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the next two years. Calling on the international community to address the problem of child labour and exploitation in the labour market in the post-2015 era  some delegates stressed that children must be able to enjoy fundamental freedoms.  Some stated the obvious  that children deserved a childhood.  Summing up a view heard during the day-long meeting  Ecuador’s delegate said “when we invest in early childhood  we invest in breaking the cycle of poverty”. A number of speakers raised concerns about emerging online threats coming from online media  and specifically social media.  A speaker from the Philippines said cyber pornography was a new form of child sexual exploitation.  There was a need to create a safe information and communications technology environment for children  she urged.  China’s speakers agreed  saying that to combat that scourge  a combination of national efforts and international cooperation was needed. Some States had already taken steps to address those and other Internet-related crimes against children  delegates were told.  Given the rapidly rising nature of those online threats around the world  Sri Lanka’s representative said his Government had established a Cyber Watch Unit to identify sex offenders and potential perpetrators. Some speakers outlined steps their governments had taken to implement the Convention  including reforming laws  providing tailored programmes and ensuring that children had access to education  health care and other essential services.  Poland’s representative said even though challenges remained in fully implementing the Convention  the instrument had had a positive impact.  He said child delegates to parliaments and the United Nations  student governments  debate teams and young bloggers  writers and journalists were proof of the increasing voice of the youth  awareness of their rights and their involvement in decision-making processes. Concluding its discussions on the advancement of women  delegates said without their empowerment  no development was possible.  Among other topics raised  delegates discussed domestic and sexual violence  forced marriage  gender gaps in education  maternal health  access to sanitation and the role of advancement of women in sustainable development. Delegates participating in the debate on the advancement of women were speakers representing Armenia  Tajikistan  Bangladesh  Kyrgyzstan  Djibouti  Monaco and Tonga  as well as the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.  Representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross  the International Labour Organization  and the Food and Agricultural Organization also delivered statements. Delivering statements on the rights of children were representatives of Haiti  Kuwait  Pakistan  Zimbabwe  Belarus  Iceland  Oman  Qatar  Kazakhstan  Paraguay  Algeria  Panama  Namibia  Iran  Lebanon  Lesotho  Yemen  Kenya  Turkey  Burkina Faso  Indonesia  Congo  United Republic of Tanzania  Republic of Korea  Uruguay  Rwanda  Egypt  Bulgaria  Niger  Viet Nam  Maldives  Georgia  Liberia  Sudan  Eritrea  Kyrgyzstan  Botswana  Bahrain  Albania  Ukraine  Togo  Azerbaijan  South Sudan  Burundi  Tunisia  Monaco  Montenegro  Angola  Zambia  Tonga  Guatemala  and Nigeria  as well as the Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine and the Permanent Observer of the Sovereign Order of Malta.  A representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross also delivered a statement. In exercise of the right of reply  a representative of the Russian Federation spoke. The Third Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Monday  20 October to conclude its discussion on the rights of children and take up its agenda item on the rights of indigenous people. Background The Third Committee met this morning to continue its consideration of the advancement of women and the rights of children.  For background  see Press Release GA/SHC/4104. Debate on Advancement of Women ZOHRAB MNATSAKANYAN (Armenia) said executive and legislative acts had been adopted to deal with ensuring women’s rights  including even more vulnerable groups  such as those with disabilities  refugee women  those facing poverty and victims of trafficking.  A strategy had also been adopted  he added  to address issues stemming from the consequences of population ageing and the social protection of the elderly  including women.  On the issues of female refugees and internally displaced persons resulting from the war in the late 1980s  he said that they received increased access to housing  social and health services  education  and employment. MAHMADAMIN MAHMADAMINOV (Tajikistan) said his country supported the central role of the United Nations in the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action  which promoted gender equality and strengthened the role of women in all spheres of life.  Noting the positive dynamic in the advancement of legislation on gender equality in Tajikistan  he underlined that his country was working in cooperation with international organizations and civil society to implement the adopted legislation effectively.  Concluding  he said  Tajikistan had paid special attention to improving health services in order to increase awareness of population issues  including reproductive health  family planning  hygiene and HIV/AIDS. ABULKALAM ABDUL MOMEN (Bangladesh) said “within a woman is the power to create  nurture and transform”.  Therefore  without the advancement of women  no development was possible.  In the public sector  a 10 per cent quota was maintained for women to enhance their access to employment.  Educating girls free of cost was the best step towards women’s empowerment and against violence against women  child marriage and extremist mind sets  he added.  By ensuring women’s access to credit  facilitating their education and extending health care  and also developing gender-sensitive budget allocation  Bangladesh had been able to make significant progress in the empowerment of women  he concluded. MADINA KARABAEVA (Kyrgyzstan) said it was impossible to build a democratic society without gender empowerment.  Her country was strongly committed to the Beijing Declaration and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women  and other international instruments.  Women played a key role in ensuring food security and improving the well-being of their families  yet they continually faced discrimination and stereotyping.  In 2012  her country adopted a national strategy to achieve gender equality by 2020  focusing on women in the economy  and education for girls.  The presence of women in political decision-making positions  including in the Ministry of Finance and the justice system  had improved tremendously.  Further  laws had been strengthened to combat violence  including programmes for women suffering from violence that provided free confidential psychological aid. KADRA AHMED HASSAN (Djibouti) stressed the importance of regional and international instruments in dealing with the advancement of women.  The question of gender equality was a core issue for her Government.  Legal reform included setting 18 as the minimum age of marriage in the family code.  Further  Djibouti  had established a ministry for advancement of women and family planning.  A national gender policy aimed at instituting behavioural and structural changes.  The representation of women in the political sphere  which had been non-existent in the 1980s  had improved greatly  with women participating in local and national elections.  In addition  there was no longer a gap between girls and boys at the primary school level because of incentives  such as grants and food distribution given to counter stereotypes about girl’s education. BENJAMIN VALLI (Monaco) said while there had been some progress made in the advancement of the status of women  there were still too many girls subjected to domestic and sexual violence and forced into marriage.  Noting that 2015 would mark the twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action  it would be the right time for the implementation of commitments of the advancement of women.  Congratulating Malala Yousafzai  the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize  he said gender equality was the foundation for poverty eradication and sustainable economic development.  Concluding  he said Monaco would continue to invest in women through national policies  job creation  international cooperation and other initiatives  including maternal health services and micro-financing. MAHE’ULI’ULI SANDHURST TUPOUNIUA (Tonga) said his country was determined to advance the goals of equality  development and peace for all women.  Recognizing that violence against women inhibited the process of social and economic development  he said gender equality and women’s empowerment had a transformative effect on sustainable development  and were drivers of economic growth in small island developing States.  Welcoming the important work of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community in emphasizing women’s human rights and empowerment  he called for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and girls  and the integration of a gender perspective in priority areas for sustainable development. ANNE CHRISTENSEN  of the Permanent Observer Mission of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies  said that the Millennium Development Goals had resulted in significant progress for women and girls  yet a number of critical gaps remained  such as maternal health and access to sanitation.  In particular  she said  discrimination and violence against women had significantly hampered progress in achieving the Millennium Goals.  Despite challenges in responding to the humanitarian needs  global initiatives  such as the United Nations Secretary General’s UNiTE to End Violence against Women campaign and the Call to Action on Violence against Women and Girls in Emergencies  were essential in addressing the issue. “Crises come not only in the form of conflict and natural disasters  but also in the form of health emergencies  such as the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa ” she continued  adding that women had been affected by that outbreak as victims  healthcare workers and caregivers.  In that regard  it was crucial that women were equally equipped with the knowledge and skills to contain the outbreak  care for those affected and to dispel fears.  Concluding  she called upon all stakeholders to accelerate their delivery of better prevention and better care. MARIE-LOUISE TOUGAS  of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said women were not “inherently vulnerable” during armed conflicts  but often suffered “devastating effects” despite the general protections afforded civilians and specific protections given to them.  Conflict hampered women’s access to health care  food  and water  and studies were needed to better understand and respond to women’s needs at such times.  Despite the “grave and dehumanizing” consequences of using sexual violence as a “deliberate tactic of war”  its prevalence and consequences had been vastly underrated because of cultural taboos  feelings of shame or fears of retaliation.  Urging States and humanitarian organizations to assume that sexual violence was occurring during conflicts and to respond accordingly  she said medical  mental health and psychosocial care was “absolutely essential for victims”.  The ICRC could help communities establish methods to minimize violations  like digging wells close to villages to shorten distances women and girls had to travel for water.  States bore primary responsibility  however  and should integrate international humanitarian law in their legal systems.  Victims had to be informed about support available  and be able to report allegations safely  “without fear of reprisal  stigma  or unnecessary lengthy procedures”. ASAD GADDI  of the Permanent Observer Mission of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta  said that violence against women harmed families and communities across generations.  Further  over half of new HIV infections worldwide were occurring among young people between the ages of 15 and 24  and more than 60 per cent of the HIV-positive youth were female.  The Order of Malta had played an important role in deepening the campaign to end violence against women.  Since 1996  the Order had been active in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo  where it supported numerous projects including health  educational  agricultural and social programmes.  The Order of Malta was active in more than 30 African countries  and had been fighting the AIDS epidemic in Nairobi for the last decade.  In South Sudan  it had helped to build a secondary school for young girls.  The international community must continue to fight for maternal health and the empowerment of women  he concluded. KEVIN CASSIDY  of the International Labour Organization (ILO)  said gender-based violence was exceptionally dehumanizing  pervasive  and oppressive  and was a clear violation of basic human rights.  In sectors where the workforce was highly feminized  women were particularly exposed to violence  such as sexual harassment  verbal or psychological abuse  intimidation  mobbing and bullying.  “This severely discriminatory behaviour should not be tolerated  trivialized or brushed-off ” he said  adding that it was a significant barrier to women’s access to equal treatment and opportunities in the labour market.  A newly adopted protocol to the Forced Labour Convention created specific obligations to protect its victims and to provide access to remedies.  Additionally  he said  the ILO had launched a fair recruitment initiative in collaboration with partner organizations and governments to address regulatory and enforcement gaps  and to ensure the implementation of recruitment practices based on international standards. LAUREN FLEJZOR  of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO)  said the State of Food Insecurity in the World 2014 report noted that 13.5 per cent of the overall population remained underfed.  In rural areas  where women had less access to household resources  women and girls were at greater risks of malnutrition.  It was vital to give women greater access to productive resources.  Gender disparities were very evident with regard to land ownership.  It was time to work towards women’s right to land  she said  emphasizing that rural women were agents of change and without them  the international community would not achieve the successful completion of the post-2015 agenda. Debate of Rights of Children MARIE FRANÇOISE BERNADEL (Haiti) said that her country continued to face significant challenges that had had profound repercussions on the situation of children.  The devastating earthquake of 2010 had compromised the country’s progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  For its part  the Haitian Government was working with various partners  including the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  to address a range of issues and to protect the rights of the child.  In closing  she called on the international community for “a new wave of support” to help the country continue its progress in the field of human rights. ALI AL-BAKHAYTT (Kuwait) said that the United Nations and international partners must work to put an end to conflicts that were affecting the rights of children.  Kuwait’s constitution protected their rights  and the country had ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its optional protocols.  Kuwait had stipulated that the family was the basis of society  and the State must protect all young people.  In the area of health  the constitution emphasized the State’s responsibility to prevent disease and epidemics.  Achievements included that infant mortality had been reduced to 1 per 1 000  and that free education was available up to university level. SAHEBZADA AHMED KHAN (Pakistan) said despite commendable achievements mentioned in the Secretary General’s reports  57 million children remained out of school  and 685 million children lived in extreme poverty.  Infections from HIV and polio had yet to be completely eradicated  he said  adding that undernutrition remained among the major challenges causing disease and deaths among children in developing countries.  There was an urgent need for a determined push to overcome remaining gaps and challenges as the international community was approaching the last year of the Millennium Goals.  Further  child education and polio eradication were at the forefront of his Government’s priorities and policies.  Pakistan was firmly committed to full realization of the universally-recognized rights of children. FREDERICK MUSIIWA MAKAMURE SHAVA (Zimbabwe) said the world had made significant progress in advancing the rights of children.  Zimbabwe had  for its part  undertaken a number of initiatives to ensure that children received the nurturing they deserved  and that their rights were fully protected.  Underlining the key role of family  he said the Government had implemented social protection programmes for vulnerable children.  His country had also paid special attention to the situation of orphans and vulnerable children  whose numbers had increased since the advent of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  Recognizing the importance of social protection for that vulnerable group  they had established a social protection mechanism as part of the National Action Plan for Orphans and Vulnerable Children. MOHD SHAHAFEEZ SHAHARIS (Malaysia) said that “the colours of our country’s future  which we hope will be bright  will be painted by our children”.  At the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child  almost all Member States had acceded to the instrument  a testament to the will of the world in promoting the rights of the children.  For its part  his Government had approved its Child Act  as well as two policies on children  to deal with various issues related to protection from violence  and including them in development.  Violence against children was unjustifiable  he said  adding that Malaysia had established a hotline and a nationwide alert system to deal with children at risk and missing children.  As Malaysia was elected yesterday as a non-permanent member of the Security Council  he said the subject of children and armed conflict would be a priority area for his country during its two-year term. PALITHA KOHONA (Sri Lanka) said the constitution guaranteed equality for all citizens  and allowed for special affirmative action in the case of vulnerable groups.  Being fully committed to the protection and empowerment of children  the Government had partnered with UNICEF to provide resources to improve the efficiency of the judicial process for child abuse victims.  Since the end of internal conflict in 2009  the Government had launched massive development programmes to develop former conflict zones and uplift the lives of affected women and children.  Despite significant achievements  child nutrition was still a concern in Sri Lanka  where 17 per cent of children under age five suffered from malnutrition.  Also  he continued  the abuse of children through social media had become a recent challenge  rapidly rising not just in his own country but around the world.  In that regard  the Government had established a Cyber Watch Unit to identify sex offenders and potential sex offenders.  In conclusion  he cited Buddha  who had said “what is done to children is done to society”. BOGUSŁAW WINID (Poland) said his country initiated the drafting of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and appreciated the international community’s efforts to promote the rights of children.  Child delegates to parliaments and the United Nations  student governments  debate teams and young bloggers  writers  and journalists were proof of the increasing voice of the youth  awareness of their rights  and their involvement in decision-making processes.  With UNICEF reporting that each year between 500 million and 1.5 billion children experience violence  including all forms of physical or mental violence  he called on the United Nations to create mandates for special rapporteurs and other representatives for children’s issues.  Concluding  he invited all Member states to an exhibition entitled “Poland and the Convention on the Rights of the Child — the legacy of Janusz Korczak” that his delegation would be organizing on November 20. IRINA VELICHKO (Belarus) said despite significant achievements and progress that had been made in the field of the rights of the child  the world was far from ensuring their protection and providing a happy childhood for all children.  Belarus has taken a number of steps  she said.  Initiatives were also being implemented in cooperation with UNICEF.  Combatting violence against women and children and supporting the rights of children were two main priorities for her Government.  Concluding  she said Belarus hoped to increase its potential partnership with UNICEF and other United Nations agencies and Member States  in the pursuit of protecting the rights of the child. THORVARDUR ATLI THÓRSSON (Iceland) said that the Convention on the Rights of the child was one of the most internationally recognized treaties on the planet  and provided a solid foundation for tackling new and emerging challenges to children’s rights.  Iceland was particularly concerned that the births of nearly 230 million children under the age of five worldwide had never been officially recorded.  That was particularly true in countries dealing with armed conflict or civil war.  The suffering of children was further compounded by the fact that nearly half of the world’s forcibly displaced people were children.  Children from Syria  Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia had been forced to flee from their homes  and Palestinian children were still living under occupation.  Therefore  Iceland firmly supported draft goal 16 on rule of law in the sustainable development agenda. ZWEENA ALOFIA (Oman) said that children’s rights were social rights that guaranteed the survival of society.  For its part  Oman had adhered to many conventions and protocols  including the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Her country had also attributed a great deal of importance to creating institutions that catered to the development of the child.  In order to promote education for children  her Government had created institutions that supported that notion.  In closing  she said Oman also had established a body whose mandate was to follow through on the Convention and to promote its implementation. FAHAD AL-KHATARIN (Qatar) said that the phenomenon of violence against children had not diminished  with women and girls suffering the most.  Political will and concerted efforts at all levels of society and governments were necessary to improve the current state of children’s rights.  Qatar had ratified the Convention and had made it an integral part of its laws.  Various governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were working together to implement those laws.  Education and rehabilitating children with special needs were priority areas for Qatar.  Violations against educational institutions in armed conflicts and recruitment of child soldiers exposed children to danger  he said.  Children must be able to enjoy fundamental freedoms.  It was necessary to collect data at a global level in order to create better policies  he concluded. KAIRAT ABDRAKHMANOV (Kazakhstan) said the Convention was one of the first international documents that had been guiding Kazakhstan  after its independence  towards improving the quality of life of children and their full and harmonious development.  Fully supporting the measures undertaken by UNICEF  good progress had been made in implementing Millennium Goals at the national level  including achieving goals on universal primary education and gender equality in primary and secondary education.  Further  he said  the Council of NGOs had been established within the Committee on the Protection of Children of the Ministry of Education and Science  to ensure full interaction between governmental and non-governmental agencies dealing with children’s issues.  Despite all the progress achieved  he said  the situation required continued detailed assessments  awareness raising and responses. MARCELO SCAPPINI (Paraguay) said children and adolescents made up 36 per cent of his country.  With 2.5 million people under age 18  it brought with it both challenges and opportunities.  Young people defined the future of the country  he said.  Yet the principal problems for Paraguay included the mistreatment of children and violence against them  child trafficking and incidents reported on vulnerable groups  including boys and girls in rural areas and indigenous communities.  Those and other challenges were exacerbated by poverty  which was too often an obstacle to their development.  In that regard  Paraguay considered that it was significantly important for the Government to include poverty eradication and inclusive social development in its short- to long-term national plans. XAVIER LASSO MENDOZA (Ecuador) said that his country wished to guarantee children the full exercise of all rights.  While that was an inexhaustible task   his country had achieved historic progress in education.  One of the harmful effects of neoliberalism was the spreading of child labour  he said.  The Ecuadorian Government had eradicated child labour through a comprehensive campaign.  With regard to migrant children  Ecuador had also made a firm and respectful request to countries of destination to guarantee the rights of all children  whether migrants or not.  Ecuador’s public policies aimed at strengthening early childhood development and were coordinated in an inter-sectorial way.  “When we invest in early childhood ” he said  “we invest in breaking the cycle of poverty.” BAKHTA SELMA MANSOURI (Algeria) said that her country was concerned about the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict  which was prevalent in many parts of the world.  Expressing support for the “Children  Not Soldiers” campaign  she added that children in the occupied Palestinian territories continued to suffer.  Algeria called for the accountability for the crimes committed by Israel.  Despite efforts to end violence against children  progress was too slow to make a genuine breakthrough.  For its part  Algeria had introduced several provisions in its national laws to protect the rights of the child  and was leading a tireless fight against child labour. BERNARDITO CLEOPAS AUZA  Permanent Observer of the Holy See  said that every outbreak of an epidemic and every natural disaster had the potential to roll back progress in reducing child mortality and improving access to nutrition  safe water and education.  But it was even more tragic when such rollbacks were caused by human–perpetrated tragedies.  In recent years  3 million children had been killed in armed conflicts  and the recruitment of child soldiers persisted  with the phenomenon spreading to new regions.  Further  prenatal selection eliminated babies suspected of having disabilities and female children  he said  emphasizing his concern that too many children lacked housing  food and medicines.  Calling on governments and civil society to encourage all initiatives aimed at the protection of the rights of the child  he concluded by emphasizing the Catholic Church’s services to children  through its more than 300 000 social and educational institutions around the world. PAULINA FRANCESCHI (Panama) said that genuine national wealth was found in people  beginning with children and youth.  Despite good economic and development indicators  inequality in Panama continued to affect the population  particularly those in rural areas and indigenous communities.  A total of 18.9 per cent of the population was experiencing extreme poverty and its attendant problems.  A national secretariat worked to enhance policies geared towards adolescents and the family  and had launched several programmes  including “Sure Step”  which gave personalized care to children in social risk situations  and “Make Your Mark”  which concentrated on rebuilding family relations for children who had been abandoned.  Efforts were also in place to eradicate child labour and exploitation in the labour market  she said  adding that Panama had worked with the United Nations and UNICEF to build a comprehensive plan for early childhood and youth. WILFRIED EMVULA (Namibia) said that his country had adopted the Convention and the first two protocols in 1990  and had enacted specific legislation that translated its articles into national laws.  In 2008  the African Child Policy Forum ranked Namibia as the second most child-friendly country on the continent.  The current national development plan contained important provisions for children  including an emphasis on early childhood development  as well as a specific focus on orphans and other vulnerable groups.  Many children in Namibia were robbed of “the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents”  because children found themselves carrying out the huge responsibility of heading households and caring for other children due to consequences of HIV/AIDS and migration.  Therefore  Namibia sought to establish policies that strengthened and supported families. REN XIAOXIA (China) said assuring the rights of children was faced with a myriad of challenges ranging from war to poverty to diseases.  Those challenges were especially affecting children with disabilities and those from ethnic minorities.  Economic discrimination made it impossible for children to enjoy their rights to participate fully  she added.  Poverty endangered children’s survival  she continued  and had serious implications on a psychological level.  The rapid development of information and communication technologies (ICTs) had changed the lives of millions of people  including children  who benefitted from access to online resources.  However  she noted that the Internet had brought new challenges  including cyber-pornography.  To combat that scourge  a combination of national efforts and international cooperation was needed  she concluded. MOHAMMAD GHAEBI (Iran) spoke of the country’s commitment to ensure the rights of children  to protect them from negligence and exploitation.  At the national level  legislation had been developed to promote and protect their rights.  Turning to the justice system  he noted that court sessions involving children were always held behind closed doors and in the presence of their parents or legal guardian  he said  adding that children under 18 were not sent to prison.  Despite progress made at the national and international levels  he said it was regrettable that armed conflicts had the greatest impact on children  separating them from their parents and making them vulnerable to exploitation  killing and maiming.  He called for the post-2015 development agenda to address the needs of children and to protect their rights. REEM JULIA MANSOUR  of the Permanent Observer Mission for the State of Palestine  drew attention to the impact of recent Israeli attacks in Palestine and the impact that and the occupation and oppression had on children  who “had borne the brunt”.  Over 50 days  500 children were killed and 3 100 wounded — 1 000 of those so seriously that they would suffer permanent disability.  A total of 373 000 remained in urgent need of psychosocial support  with many orphaned  made homeless or missing the start of the new school year.  They also suffered from the illegally imposed blockade imposed by the occupying Power  which she called a “gross form of collective punishment”.  Israel should uphold international law and give children the chance to lead normal lives  while the international community should protect Palestinians until the occupation ended.  Israel claimed to be the region’s only democracy  she said  but it was also the only State that systematically prosecuted children in military courts  often arresting and detaining children without trial.  In detention  they were subject to abuse  torture and trauma.  Condemning all violence against all children  “Palestinian or Israeli”  she said Palestine had worked within the constraints imposed on it to protect children  and had acceded to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. MAYA DAGHER (Lebanon) said her country’s constitution had guaranteed equality for all members of society  including children.  Legal agreements  laws and decrees in the area of education  employment  social security  health and justice had been developed and adopted.  “Education is the ideal means to empower children ” she said  adding that education protected them from becoming victims of exploitation and violence.  She said that mandatory education was a way to protect children  especially girls  as it prepared them to become citizens.  Despite the progress made to decrease school drop-out rates and increase enrolment  the humanitarian crisis posed a threat to those developments.  The 1.5 million Syrian and Palestinian refugees  mostly children and women  who were in Lebanon  had been creating a serious crisis for the country.  She then called on for additional efforts from the international community to support Lebanon. KELEBONE MAOPE (Lesotho) said his country was aware that poverty eradication had become a chronic challenge.  “No country can do it alone ” he said  calling for international cooperation for achieving this.  HIV/AIDS remained a big challenge for Lesotho as the epidemic had hindered child and maternal health  and affected educational outcomes of orphaned and vulnerable children.  Therefore  Lesotho had adopted a policy in 2006 to prevent  control and manage the spread of those diseases. INTISAR NASSER MOHAMMED ABDULLAH (Yemen) said her country had taken steps in promoting the rights of the child through international instruments and national initiatives.  After being born  every child had the right to a name  nationality and services  she said  and the State had to take care of children who had lost their families.  Children could not be made to work  and the State must protect them against all forms of discrimination  sexual exploitation and family violence.  They should not participate in armed conflicts or be recruited if they were younger than 18  she said.  To address those and related concerns  the Government had established certain institutions that dealt with the rights of the child  including a special ministry on human rights and a national committee for children.  Despite its modest capabilities  Yemen had achieved great success in promoting the rights of children  especially in relation to health.  However  the problem of poverty and malnutrition remained  she said in conclusion. ANDREW KIHURANI (Kenya)  aligning himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the African Group  said he was proud to have been co-Chair of the Open Working Group on the sustainable development goals  which had addressed concerns about children in eight of the 17 proposed goals.  Humanitarian crises  like the Ebola outbreak  threatened to roll back years of hard-won successes for children.  Kenya had received an influx of refugees fleeing conflict and humanitarian crises  nearly half of whom were children.  Nonetheless  Kenya’s commitment to ensuring the rights and welfare of children remained.  Cultural barriers to girls’ education had been whittled down  with differences in enrolment declining.  Further  his Government had collaborated with the Global Fund and civil society to reduce HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis  and was one of 22 countries involved in the Global Plan for the elimination of new HIV infections among children by 2015. YIĞIT CANAY (Turkey) said programmes had been developed to address the issues of child protection and reform of the juvenile justice system  among others.  Monitoring centres had also been established to provide a rapid response to child abuse.  Special emphasis had been placed on the girl child  especially on guaranteeing and encouraging her education.  Noting that inequality  poverty and a lack of health and education services had prevented children from fully enjoying their rights  he called on the international community to remove those barriers.  Responding to allegations made by one delegation  he quoted a United Nations report  which called Turkey’s emergency response to the influx of Syrian refugees “exemplary”  as it had provided protection for more than 1.5 million Syrians living in Turkey. ALI DEME (Burkina Faso) said 53 per cent of his country’s population was below 18 years of age  making the promotion and protection of their rights a priority.  Guaranteeing a healthy environment remained a concern high on the Government’s agenda.  Progress had been made  especially in the area of education  as the rate of enrolment had improved to 83.2 per cent.  However  challenges persisted  especially due to a lack of financial resources and poor coordination.  He expressed concern over the difficult situation faced by children due to conflict  abuse through information and communication technologies  and human trafficking  calling on States to allocate the necessary resources to protect them. YULIANA BAHAR (Indonesia)  associating himself with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  said action for children should not be based on charity.  Rather  children must be empowered to ensure they climbed “the ladder of life”.  In Indonesia  children were protected by the constitution  and progress had been shared with the Committee on the Rights of the Child.  Institutions had been strengthened  with an expanded mandate for the Ministry of Women’s Empowerment and Child Protection  and a Child Protection Commission that independently monitored children’s rights violations.  Health care was being improved through grassroots approaches  and free education was granted on the basis of equal opportunity.  A presidential decree had been issued on Holistic and Integrated Early Childhood Development.  She noted a national action plan to combat violence against children  and a law to tackle sexual violence specifically.  A new law on juvenile justice emphasized diversion and restorative justice  while female genital mutilation had been outlawed. RAYMOND SERGE BALÉ (Congo) said the situation of children in his country had seen progress  and the adoption of various laws on the subject showed his Government’s political will to provide a legal corpus dedicated to their protection.  Positive results had been achieved with regard to children’s enrolment in education.  However  many young girls  particularly from disadvantaged backgrounds  continued to be deprived of the right to education.  He described several initiatives undertaken by his Government  such as training for those involved in children’s protection  and urgent relief measures to reduce both infant mortality and the transmission of HIV from mothers to children.  The Government continued its support for all children  particularly for the vulnerable and those with disabilities  to prepare them for a better future. JOSEPHINE LYENGI (United Republic of Tanzania)  aligning with the African Group and the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  said the Law of the Child Act and the Children’s Act for Zanzibar had strengthened fundamental rights  ensuring justice for child offenders  witnesses and victims.  Government policies had helped achieve almost 100 per cent gender equality in primary school enrolment  while health interventions were reducing child mortality.  A national study on violence against children had revealed “troubling” statistics  but it also “provided an opportunity for breaking the silence” around that issue.  Among efforts to combat such abuse  a child helpline had been set-up  and the Education Act would soon be repealed or amended  in order to end corporal punishment in schools.  In addition  a national task force on street children had been launched  while an action plan to protect the most vulnerable would aim to reach 2.5 million children needing household care  education and health.  He supported the “Children  Not Soldiers” report and called for an end to the targeting of children in conflicts. HAHN CHOONGHEE (Republic of Korea) said many older Koreans had used stationery provided by UNICEF when they studied in primary schools  adding that education had empowered them and brought economic growth and social development.  In 2013  the Government had contributed to the Fund as a testament of its will to repay the international community  especially with regard to children’s education and well-being.  In addition  he said that at the national level  a special law had been enacted for children with disabilities  providing them with medial subsidies  care services and family welfare support services. JORGE DOTTA (Uruguay) said his Government attached the highest priority to children’s rights in both internal and external policies  having formulated policies that took into account the Convention’s recommendations.  As a country which previously had seen more than 60 per cent of its people under the age of 18 living in poverty  Uruguay was now an example that tackling children’s issues in a cross-cutting manner could benefit society as a whole.  He noted with concern the increase in violence and exploitation  saying that regulations had been developed to tackle those issues.  He then expressed concern over the presence of children in armed conflicts  calling for a comprehensive study on that issue. JEANNE D’ARC BYAJE (Rwanda) said the Convention had received more ratifications than any other human rights instrument  but despite such progress  the implementation of legal provisions on the ground remained elusive.  Her country had taken steps to improve the legal and institutional framework for the protection of the rights of the child  and regularly submitted reports on the implementation of the Convention and its two additional protocols.  The National Commission for Children had been established mainly to protect children suffering from abuse  violence and exploitation.  Rwanda had also empowered families and communities as centres for the protection and full development of children  hence the decision to close orphanages and integrate orphans into family-based care.  Measures had been taken to break barriers to education  including building local schools for children to prevent absenteeism due to long travelling distances. IRENE SUSAN BARREIRO NATIVIDAD (Philippines) said “the most precious human capital are our children”  which was why her country had put in place a social development programme that addressed their educational  nutritional and health needs.  A conditional cash transfer programme provided monthly cash grants to families  premised on them sending their children to school  bringing them to a health centre for check-ups and attending family development sessions.  The goal of the programme was for children to finish high school so they could have a greater chance of getting employed  thus breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty.  Her country had also provided for a universal health care programme and passed a reproductive health law to address child and maternal deaths.  Cyber pornography was a new form of child sexual exploitation  she said  highlighting the need to create a safe ICT environment for children. OSAMA ABDELKHALEK MAHMOUD (Egypt)  endorsing the statement made on behalf of the Africa Group  and renewing the invitation for the Special Rapporteur on child prostitution to visit his country  said that children must be at the core of the post-2015 agenda  with a view of realizing their fundamental right to education.  Wider and more coherent partnerships at all levels were needed to operationalize national action plans.  Welcoming recent cooperation agreements on children and armed conflict  he condemned all involvement of children in such conflicts as well as attacks on schools in Gaza  urging an end to impunity for those acts.  His country  he stated  was on track to meeting the Millennium Goals on education  child mortality and maternal health  with programmes being implemented in strong partnership with UNICEF.  There were national programmes to aid street children and to end all forms of violence against all children.  He looked forward for more resources to bolster the fight against female genital mutilation  which  he added  persisted in many countries in Africa. STEPHAN TAFROV (Bulgaria) said tailored children-centred policies and strategies had been developed and implemented  especially through the promotion of good parenting  the provision of high-quality services for children and families and ensuring access to quality education and health care for all children.  Efforts had been made to provide effective support to families at risk  in order to prevent the separation of children from their families.  In shaping the post-2015 development framework  he continued  Bulgaria advocated for the inclusion of children and young adolescents in the discussions  believing that children’s rights should be at the heart of it. AMINA LOUALI (Niger) said it was the international community’s duty to follow up and act on the conventions that protected the rights of the child.  Niger had prioritized education with free schools and the enrolment of girls.  Many girls  particularly the most disadvantaged  still did not finish their schooling due to security or cultural or economic reasons.  When they did go to school  obstacles  such as early marriages  prevented them from reaching their potential.  She concluded by calling on the international community to accelerate progress in promoting and protecting the rights of all children. DO HUNG VIET (Viet Nam) said that children should be at the heart of discussions on the new development agenda.  Hundreds of millions of children were living in extreme poverty and in every region of the world  children faced risks of violence.  The international community must recommit to protecting the rights of each and every child.  The peaceful settlement of disputes  poverty eradication and giving all boys and girls equal access to quality education were crucial steps for a better future.  Viet Nam was the second country in the world to ratify the Convention and had integrated it into the country’s national policies.  Having achieved universal primary education  his country was moving towards universal secondary education  and was working towards eliminating gender inequality in education. JEFFREY SALIM WAHEED (Maldives) said in his country the greatest threat to children and their future was climate change.  Children accounted for 44 per cent of the population  and the promotion and protection of their rights was a high priority.  Maldives had ratified the Convention in 1991  soon after it was opened for signature  and was among the first signatories of its Third Optional Protocol on communications.  Highlighting various efforts to strengthen the system for enforcing children’s rights  he said numerous challenges remained  such as a high divorce rate and severe housing conditions  which exposed children to physical abuse.  The Government was committed to delivering youth-oriented policies and was investing heavily in education  he concluded. TAMTA KUPRADZE (Georgia)  aligning his delegation with the statement delivered by the European Union  noted that domestic violence had been criminalized.  An action plan to combat domestic violence and to protect its victims had three main goals: improving legislative mechanisms for prevention  protection  and assistance to victims; rehabilitation of victims; and preventive measures and awareness-raising.  She described several other plans seeking to harmonize national policy with the Convention on the Rights of the Child  and pointed also to efforts made to help displaced children.  She set out “grave concerns” over serious violations of the rights of children in occupied parts of Georgia.  They were deprived of internationally recognized rights to education in their mother tongue and health care.  Barriers on the occupation line had prevented free movement  even in the case of medical emergency  and Georgian children had been subjected to ethnically targeted violence in occupied regions. MARJON KAMARA (Liberia) recalled that for years  his country had been too dangerous a place for children to play.  It had made “incredible” progress on children’s rights  having become in 2011 one of the first countries to enact comprehensive legislation with the National Children’s Act.  Recent statistics had shown that 23.4 per cent of survivors of gender-based violence were between the ages of 6 and 12  most having suffered statutory rape  sexual abuse  sexual assault  sodomy and trafficking.  Last year  Liberia signed an agreement with UNICEF for the 2013-2017 period  enhancing Government efforts to protect children.  Through education and advocacy  among other efforts  practices such as early marriage and female genital mutilation were gradually being eliminated. MOHAMED IBRAHIM MOHAMED ELBAHI (Sudan) said the rights of the child had priority on his Government’s agenda  which was proven by the ratification of all conventions on children.  At the national level  initiatives undertaken in conjunction with UNICEF to improve the situation of children had made an impact.  He underlined the need to assist conflict-affected States in bringing about dialogue with opposing groups.  Referring to the Secretary-General’s reports  he said information contained therein should be verified and correct.  He was concerned that some rebels were wearing uniforms similar to a national army  which he said was a way to trick other parties.  He therefore asked that the Government of Sudan could be permitted to clarify any information before it was included in reports.  He also asked that data and numbers were shared with Government and the capital  and not only with accredited missions. ELSA HAILE (Eritrea) said the traditional maxim “testisbuqu n’qu’ol’u”  meaning “all the good things for children”  described concisely how her society viewed them both as vulnerable and as an asset for the future.  Ensuring their rights and well-being through development was her Government’s top priority.  As a result of its policies  Eritrea had achieved health-related Millennium Development Goals.  Moreover  polio had been eradicated and vaccinations against different diseases had been regularly and widely conducted.  She also said that educational centres had been built in previously disadvantaged areas  and mobile schools had been effective in providing nomadic communities with access to education. Ms. KARABAEVA (Kyrgyzstan) said that the country’s new constitution guaranteed the rights of the child  including those in vulnerable situations  such as those with disabilities.  In order to achieve progress  comprehensive measures backed up by the appropriate resources were necessary.  Her country had put in place a strong system of education  which supported those studying in primary and secondary schools  in order to protect the right to education for all children.  There was also a national system for sexual health protection.  Kyrgyzstan was also one of the first post-Soviet States to adopt World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for live births  and had achieved the appropriate level of birth registration.  For its part  Kyrgyzstan was now working to strengthen and support the family  she said. MPHO MOGOBE (Botswana) said great efforts had been made to ensure access to — and the quality of — education in the country  as it was recognised as a pre-requisite for a decent life.  Improvements had been made to the health infrastructure  in particular  in immunisation and supplementary feeding to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.  Concerns were related to child labour  the lack of facilities for children with disabilities  and the lack of children’s courts  mainly due to inadequate financial resources and skilled human capital.  She called on the United Nations and development partners for continued support. AMINA MOHAMMED (Bahrain) said national legislation aimed to safeguard children’s rights  and especially  to protect them from abuse.  Turning to the judicial system  she cited initiatives to protect children from torture during investigations and provide them with legal protection  as well as efforts to raise awareness about the need to protect children.  A hotline had been established to address issues of bodily torture and psychological restraint.  Actions had been taken in close cooperation with civil society and international partners  in order to avoid overlap and find solutions. ERVIN NINA (Albania)  associating himself with the European Union  said the Convention reflected a new view of the child — neither the property of parents nor helpless subjects of charity.  Children had rights in their own interest.  Yet  they still bore the burden of violence and war.  Twenty-five years after the adoption of the Convention  child rights were being violated every day.  In Albania  education for Roma children was a major challenge.  The Government’s new strategy outlined that every Roma child would be enrolled in kindergarten with or without birth certificates.  The Government would not wait for Roma mothers to knock on the doors of the school; it was now the responsibility of educators to ensure that children were registered.  The twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention was an opportunity to enhance the focus on the rights of the child. VIKTORIA SHVYDCHENKO (Ukraine)  associating herself with the European Union  said that protection of children’s rights was high on her Government’s agenda  “especially now that our people  including the little ones  are suffering from the Russian Federation’s open aggression against the country”.  Urging the Russian Federation to cease its blatant violations of international law  she said Russian-sponsored terrorist groups in eastern Ukraine were abducting children  including from orphanages and medical facilities.  More than half the children in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions had no access to education on the territory controlled by armed groups.  Ukraine was stepping up efforts to render psychological assistance to children affected by the atmosphere of intimidation and fear. EDEM KOMI AMOUDOKPO (Togo) said the more educated a child was  the less vulnerable he or she would be to poverty  conflict and violence.  He stressed his country’s investment in the education sector  which was aimed at building schools and training teachers.  Free pre-school and primary education was provided  as were meals  grants and school supplies for the most disadvantaged.  In addition  regular awareness and communication campaigns had been organized to change the behaviour of communities towards the most vulnerable groups  including girls  while a hotline to denounce abuses also had been established.  Despite significant progress  challenges persisted  especially in the retention of female students and children in rural areas. FAKHRI ALIYEV (Azerbaijan) said the protection of children’s rights had always been among the priorities of his Government.  As a country suffering from the grave consequences of aggression  Azerbaijan strongly condemned all violations of international humanitarian law committed against children in situations of armed conflict.  Underlining the progress achieved in recent years  he stressed the importance of supporting the reintegration of thousands of children  released from armed forces or groups  into society.  Urging that the root causes of armed conflicts be addressed  he reiterated his country’s commitment to continue contributing to the effective protection of children’s rights. AGOK ANYAR MADUT (South Sudan)  aligning himself with the African Group and the Group of 77 and China  said his country was an autonomous region where 51 per cent of the population was under the age of 18.  The majority of South Sudanese were young and rural-based.  In order to meet their needs  the Education Bill of 2012 had made primary school compulsory.  The ratio of girls to boys in school was improving  and could be attributed to his Government’s political will to improve gender equality and to empower the girl child.  Years of conflict had prevented South Sudan from achieving the Millennium Development Goals as they related to children.  Indeed  civil war had prevented many children from attending school.  Today  South Sudan was mobilizing and reintegrating children who had been part of the armed conflict.  The international community must not turn a blind eye to the blatant recruitment of children by rebel groups. ANESIE NDAYISHIMIYE (Burundi)  associating herself with the African Group  said children were “the world of tomorrow” and they deserved to inherit a world without conflict.  A party to the Convention since 1990  Burundi had enshrined the rights of the child in its national laws.  Free education was provided for all children  as was free health care for pregnant women and children under five years old.  Much remained to be done  as the country still suffered the effects of past conflict  poverty and HIV/AIDS.  Burundi was demobilizing child soldiers with support from UNICEF  and she commended the “Children  Not Soldiers” campaign.  A significant number of children continued to be vulnerable to poverty  and she commended those who put their lives at risk in order to bring about a better world for children. KARIMA BARDAOUI (Tunisia) expressed concern over the challenges that children continued to face  stressing that the success of the promotion and protection of children’s rights depended on collective commitment and effort.  Underlining the role of education in the new constitution  she said the Government was working to enhance children’s rights.  Calling the protection of infants a moral responsibility  she urged the international community to ensure their rights  as well as those of adolescents. ISABELLE PICCO (Monaco)  welcoming the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention  said children must live with dignity and respect.  Children were the future and the present  she said  reiterating Monaco’s support for the “Children  Not Soldiers” campaign.  Further  a lack of access to education and health care was a major challenge  and she called for international cooperation in the protection of children’s rights  which were essential for sustainable development. MILORAD ŠĆEPANOVIĆ (Montenegro)  calling the wellbeing of families “crucial” to the wellbeing of society  urged recognition of and support for the range of family “forms” within which children were being reared.  Various initiatives had led to a 40 per cent increase in the number of children in non-kinship foster families  showing that fostering was a way to improve services for children who lacked adequate parental care.  Turning to the juvenile system  he discussed the application of victim-offender mediation for juveniles  noting that work with at-risk families and on the rights of children participating in civil and administrative proceedings were areas that required further attention. ISMAEL GASPAR MARTINS (Angola)  associating himself with the African Group  SADC  and the Group of 77 and China  said his country’s constitution established several principles that guaranteed children’s rights.  Further  the Government ensured free birth registration for children  and had created registry offices within municipal administrations to accomplish that task.  The infant mortality rate had reduced considerably  while deaths due to malaria had dropped from 25 per cent to 15 per cent.  Angola was working to address the remaining challenges  including the spread of HIV/AIDS and proliferation of counterfeit medicines. JOHN ZULU (Zambia) said education was a human right essential for the exercise of all other human rights  ensuring the protection of all children in their life journey.  Significant progress had been made at the primary education level.  Recognizing that higher education and skills development were crucial for enhancing young peoples’ employability  the Government had begun building universities in each province.  He noted the persistence of child  early and forced marriage as a hindrance to girls’ economic opportunities  as well as to national development.  In addition  poverty remained a critical threat to the fulfilment of children’s rights. Mr. TUPOUNIUA (Tonga) said that his country had maintained a special focus on the education of its children and youth.  Their literacy rates were high  and primary education for both girls and boys was virtually universal  with an overwhelming majority of students continuing on to secondary education  regardless of gender.  His Government’s spending on education consistently comprised 10 to 20 per cent of the national budget.  Yet despite the attention afforded to children  they remained a vulnerable population  especially with regard to the adverse effects of climate change. MARÍA SOLEDAD URRUELA ARENALES (Guatemala) said that her country knew first-hand how children suffered during an armed conflict.  In addition to the risk of violence  resources that could be used for development and education had to be diverted.  Many of the weapons in her country were remnants of the long internal conflict the country had undergone.  No country could face such complex problems alone  she said.  Therefore  Guatemala was in favour of mechanisms  such as the Arms Trade Treaty  that aimed at reducing armed conflict.  Further  she said  the rapid development of digital technology presented great potential for education.  However  it was essential to bridge the digital gap between the children of developed and developing countries  while also ensuring that children were protected from the hidden dangers. AMINA SMAILA (Nigeria) said that her country had made considerable progress in children’s rights by adhering to relevant international instruments and by creating appropriate domestic policy frameworks.  Highlights of the Child Rights Act included provisions of the child justice administration and prohibition of female genital mutilation and early marriage.  The Act also established a committee to implement those rules and put in place specific programmes to advance child rights.  It also had a monitoring role.  Turning to armed conflict  she added that the Government of Nigeria was shocked by the deplorable acts of Boko Haram and  with the help of the United Nations and other partners  would put a stop to them.  “The Government of Nigeria had no higher priority than defeating Boko Harm and bringing back the kidnapped Chibok schoolgirls ” she stressed.  The Government was putting in place a multi-faceted strategy  focusing on making schools safer  and working with local communities and efforts aimed at de-radicalization. FIAMMA ARDITI DI CASTELVETERE MANZO  of the Permanent Observer Mission of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta  said nearly 7 million children under age 5 died every year — that was 12 children every minute.  She mentioned several initiatives undertaken by the Order in the area of nutrition  neonatal care and safe birthing.  Turning to Syria  she said that the organization was supporting a school  where 1 650 children attended class. Ms. TOUGAS  of the International Committee of the Red Cross  focused on preventing and responding to sexual violence affecting children in situations of armed conflict.  She drew attention to the absolute prohibition against rape and other forms of sexual violence by human rights law at all times  and by international humanitarian law during both international and non-international armed conflict.  Domestic implementation was essential to ensure respect for the international humanitarian law and other bodies of international law.  “Sexual violence — including that which affects children during armed conflict — is reprehensible  and its consequences are tragic.  But it is preventable”  she said  urging States and the international community to make the extra effort needed to reach that common goal. Right of Reply Speaking in exercise of the right of reply  the representative of Russian Federation said his delegation was shocked by the statement made by the delegation of Ukraine.  Underlining that thousands of lives had been affected because of Ukrainian aggression  including rocket attacks  he said that Ukraine did not understand the pointlessness of their speculation on the suffering of the population  including the children. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-17,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11571.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Sounding a note of optimism about the progress of African development  the international community should guard against complacency that might lead to backsliding on gains already made  the General Assembly was told today as it debated the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) as well as the ongoing battle against malaria.  The under-five mortality rate from malaria had been reduced by two thirds between 1990 and 2015  said a representative of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.  Intervention mechanisms had saved an estimated 3.3 million lives globally.  But  tempering the good news  he added that two African countries still accounted for about 40 per cent of worldwide malaria mortality. Togo  for its part  had implemented a strategic plan to eliminate malaria  the country’s representative said  providing special medicines and combination treatments  and distributing insecticidal nets to the most vulnerable groups.  In Ethiopia  confirmed malaria cases in 2011 declined by 66 per cent in children under the age of five  and malaria admissions and deaths fell by 81 per cent and 73 per cent respectively  the country’s representative told the Assembly.  African problems needed African solutions  said the representative of Turkey  adding that addressing conflicts on the continent would also serve development efforts  a point made by numerous other delegations from both African and other countries.  Africa depended on continued reforms by Africans themselves in investment  business and regional integration  the representative of the United States said  outlining aid initiatives her country was operating on food security  electricity provision and anti-malaria programmes all over the continent.  For example  in 2013 the United States “Feed the Future” programme reached 12.5 million children  and helped 7 million farmers incorporate new technology on 4 million hectares of land.  Another disease requiring urgent and coordinated action by the international community was the Ebola outbreak  India’s representative said  echoing statements made by nearly all delegations.    But rather than stigmatizing and isolating countries  the world should show solidarity and compassion  said the representative of Nigeria  stressing that the international community would have to face this threat together.  Sam Kutesa (Uganda)  President of the General Assembly  opened today’s meeting.   Also speaking were the representatives of Malawi (on behalf of the African Group)  Guyana (on behalf of the Caribbean Community)  Myanmar (on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations)  United Republic of Tanzania  Sierra Leone  Kuwait  Thailand  China  Zambia  South Africa  Japan  Libya  Algeria  Cameroon   Russian Federation  Congo  Egypt  Morocco  Malaysia  and Rwanda  as well as the European Union.  The Chief Executive Officer of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) Agency also spoke. The General Assembly will meet again at 10 a.m. on Monday  October 20  to discuss sport for development and peace. Background The General Assembly met this morning to hold a joint debate on two agenda items related to Africa.  On the first  the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)  the Assembly had before it three reports of the Secretary-General:  the twelfth consolidated progress report on implementation and international support (document A/69/161) for the Partnership; Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa (document A/69/162); and the Biennial report on the review of the implementation of the commitments made towards Africa’s development (document A/69/163).  The second agenda item was entitled “2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries  Particularly in Africa.” Statements SAM KUTESA (Uganda)  President of the General Assembly  said that Africa was ready to deliver on its promise.  The international community had played a crucial role in supporting Africa's growth and development  but a partnership remained of critical importance.  Through NEPAD and the adoption of programmes for infrastructure development  African leaders had laid the foundations for critical regional and continental infrastructure.  The continent needed roads  railways  and ports to support trade  as well as governance structures.  It was important that comprehensive African development programmes continued to receive attention.  Those projects would require resources  and financing by Governments alone was not enough.  Private sector funds should be tapped into.  Improved access to clean energy was crucial to Africa's sustainable development.  Turning to the other topic on today's agenda  he noted that malaria remained one of most severe health problems facing the world today.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO)  80 per cent of malaria cases in 2012 were in Africa  and pregnant women and children were especially at risk from the disease.  Since the Assembly had adopted its first resolution on malaria  the world had witnessed commitment to eradicating the disease  and more than 1.1 million deaths had been averted.  But success should not lead to complacency  he said  adding that the international community must press on with conviction and determination that this disease could be eradicated in our lifetime. CHARLES P. MSOSA (Malawi)  speaking on behalf of the African Group  acknowledged the Secretary-General’s continued commitment to placing Africa’s agenda at the heart of the United Nations system.  For their part  African Heads of Government and State endorsed the Common African Position on the post-2015 development agenda in January this year  coinciding with the formulation of the African Union’s Vision 2063  which aimed to ensure the continent’s positive socio-economic transformation for the next five decades.  NEPAD  established 20 years ago  remained the region’s strategic framework for political and socio-economic transformation on such priority areas as agriculture  infrastructure  climate change  natural resource management and regional integration.  Agriculture was at the centre of Africa’s development agenda  with the potential to contribute to eradication of poverty and hunger  increased intra-Africa trade and investments  and creation of jobs for youth  among other things  he said.  The African Union rekindled the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Programme established in 2003 through the June 2014 adoption of the Malabo Declaration on Accelerating Agricultural Growth and Transformation for Shared Prosperity and Improved Livelihoods.  That Declaration encouraged African States to sustain the Agriculture Programme’s momentum for the next decade by allocating 10 per cent of public expenditure to the agriculture sector and other measures.  Another objective was to ensure 6 per cent annual growth of the sector.  Infrastructure development was also a key priority.  The Dakar Summit  held in June  created an action plan for financing 16 pilot projects under the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa. He said that in addition to the African Peer Review Mechanism  NEPAD’s flagship governance programme  new measures were needed to fight corruption  and promote good political and socioeconomic governance  transparency and accountability  especially in natural resource management.  On health issues  he expressed concern that funding to fight malaria was far below the resources required to reach universal coverage of interventions and commended the emergency actions taken by the United Nations to the Ebola outbreak  including a decision to establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER). GEORGE TALBOT (Guyana)  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  called for a massively scaled-up global response  to the Ebola epidemic  which threatened to reverse peace-building and development gains on the continent. He voiced renewed support for NEPAD  but emphasized that Africans should decide the international support priorities.  CARICOM called on the international community to provide strong support for the Africa 2063 Agenda. Immediate threats to peace in the region needed to be effectively addressed. Though the region had experienced 4 per cent growth in 2013  it was below the 7 per cent target for sustained poverty reduction  and the impact of Ebola on prospects had not yet been fully assessed. Significantly greater progress was needed in addressing debt problems  trade needed to be more responsive  and direct investment flows would have to increase  he said.  South-South cooperation was integral to the global response.  CARICOM appreciated the intensified efforts by African countries to accelerate infrastructure development  and supported the African Peer Review Mechanism in promoting good governance.  CARICOM supported the United Nations and the African Union’s efforts in conflict prevention  peacekeeping and peace-building  which were critical to sustainable development.  With an estimated 207 million malaria cases causing 627 000 deaths in 2012  most in Africa  he called for stepped up action in the fight against the disease.  CARICOM had joined forces with the African Union to help transform their joint response to HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria  as well as the threat posed by non-communicable diseases. JAN PIROUZ POULSEN  representative of the European Union delegation  said that the Joint Africa-European Union Strategy adopted at the 2007 Summit in Lisbon set out a comprehensive partnership of equals.  Recognizing the essential role played by the African Union and NEPAD  the European Union's support went to the African Peer Review Mechanism to promote good governance in the continent  as well as other programmes.  The promotion of democratic and transparent systems of Government and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms were key components of the Joint Strategy.  Africa continued to face a huge burden of potentially preventable or treatable diseases which caused death and suffering  and also hindered development.  Although significant progress had been made against malaria  gains could be reversed if efforts were relaxed.  As the largest donor both in general and in the health sector  the European Union would continue to work with the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria as well as the United Nations system and other relevant organizations and mechanisms to support national responses in strengthening health systems. KYAW TIN (Myanmar)  speaking on behalf of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  voiced its support for NEPAD’s implementation.  The region had witnessed remarkable economic growth in recent years  reaching 4 per cent in 2013  thanks to NEPAD.  Cognizant however of the challenges encountered by some African countries in achieving the Millennium Development Goals  he called on the continent's development partners to deliver on their pledges with increased foreign direct investments and overseas development aid.  ASEAN was prepared to work side-by-side with its African partners.  It was important that the priorities of the African Common Position on the post-2015 development agenda be given special attention. He noted that peace and security continued to be threatened by armed conflicts and the recent outbreak of the Ebola virus  and was encouraged by the increase in official development assistance (ODA) into the region.  The success of Africa's Peer Review Mechanism had demonstrated African leaders’ able leadership in bringing peace and development to the continent.  He expressed hope that the international community would lend full support to the implementation of Africa's Agenda 2063  and that bilateral  South-South and triangular cooperation would bring practical benefits to African countries.  He welcomed the recent Assembly resolution that urged Governments and other stakeholders to work together to overcome challenges and expedite efforts to achieving the targets set out in the Roll Back Malaria Partnership’s Global Action Plan.  ASEAN welcomed the assistance of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  and the quick response of the Secretary-General in establishing the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response  and promised the ASEAN States full support in fighting the pandemic. PINDI HAZARA CHANA  Deputy Minister for Community Development  Gender and Children of the United Republic of Tanzania  aligning with the African Group  said ending poverty was very important for Africa and the post-2015 development agenda must carry out the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals.  NEPAD was Africa’s pride and she was confident that its work was aligned with Africa’s development aspirations in the post-2015 development agenda  including the goals of Africa’s 2063 agenda.  The United Republic of Tanzania was already implementing the actions of the Malabo Declaration  including increased investment in agriculture and promoting climate smart agriculture.  Since signing the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme in July 2010  her Government had launched the Tanzania Food Security Investment Plan  a 15-year plan to spark growth in the national economy  household income and provide food security.  Infrastructure development was also crucial for the continent’s sustainable development and regional integration.  She commended NEPAD for its steady implementation  with limited resources  of Africa’s infrastructure development programme.  The Tanzanian Constitution was being reformed to create a secure  prosperous future for the Tanzanian people. The Constitutional Assembly had adopted a draft Constitution and a referendum  by which citizens could determine the Constitution’s status  as the next critical step in the reform process. EBUN STRASSER-KING (Sierra Leone)  aligning with the Group of 77 and China  the African Group  and the Least Developed Countries  said the continent had made significant strides despite the challenges of climate change  conflicts  and pandemics.  The continent would continue to work with the international community to achieve peace by addressing poverty.  Sierra Leone had made remarkable progress in political stability through comprehensive justice-sector reforms  and the adoption of measures to address the causes of conflict through development and Government reforms.  But their gains were drastically threatened by the Ebola virus. The disease had taken thousands of lives  and impacted the entire socio-economic fabric of the country.  It posed a significant threat to security and poverty  and had imposed a kind of economic embargo on us.  Every major economic activity had either slowed down or come to a standstill. AHMAD AL-BUAIJAN (Kuwait) said that Africa had not achieved goals to combat poverty.  Arable land had not coped with a growth in population  as only 60 per cent of it could be irrigated.  The rate of population suffering from under-nutrition had only decreased modestly.  The Secretary-General's report had mentioned that Africa faced soil degradation as well as loss of biological diversity  among other challenges.  In addition  many West African countries were facing the challenge of Ebola.  Kuwait had contributed $5 million to the WHO in response to the international appeal launched by that organization.  Kuwait supported joint cooperation in order to eradicate poverty and combat diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria  he said  listing other initiatives by Kuwait related to Africa  including a prize of $1 million towards developmental projects.  NORACHIT SINHASENI (Thailand) aligned with ASEAN  called for Member States to work together to make sure the challenges of armed conflicts  terrorism  climate change  epidemics  poverty and famine did not hinder the future of Africa.  In 2013 Thailand launched the Thai-African Partnership initiative for development  economic and global improvements.  The Thailand International Development Cooperation Agency had launched agriculture-related projects  from mushroom growing  to small-scale fisheries and hatcheries.  Thailand shared its expertise to help prevent serious epidemics and grow community-based health provision  and co-sponsored the Assembly resolution on the Decade to Roll Back Malaria.  It stood ready to assist Africa to develop universal health coverage  and had contributed $152 900 to the WHO to provide rice to areas in the region stricken by the Ebola virus.  He pledged Thailand’s continued support in the form of education and training  scholarships and fellowships.  CAROL HAMILTON (United States) expressed her Government’s continued support for NEPAD. In 2013 the United States “Feed the Future” programme reached 12.5 million children  and helped 7 million farmers incorporate new technology on 4 million hectares of land.  The New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition had secured more than $7 billion in investments with more than 2.6 million farmers reached through services and contracts.  Practical  transparent business environments were critical.  At the United States-Africa Leaders Summit  measures were announced for United States investments in African development  including the provision of electricity to 60 million homes.  Africa depended on continued reforms taken by Africans themselves in investment  business  and regional integration.  She urged the international community to agree on a post-2015 development agenda  which should encompass action from all countries and sectors  and complete the Millennium Development Goals.  The United States would help people feed themselves  power their economies and care for their sick.  The United States updated anti-malaria programme now focused on supporting 19 African countries and countries of Southeast Asia  protecting 45 million people from malaria.  A new strategy for 2015-2020 would work with partner countries to help further reduce malaria. WANG MIN (China) said that the pursuit of peace and development by Africa was at a critical juncture.  The international financial crisis and the Ebola epidemic had exacerbated Africa’s humanitarian crisis.  The development of Africa should be a priority of the post-2015 development agenda.  No matter the international situation  China would always be Africa's most reliable friend  he said  adding that strengthening cooperation with African countries had always been a cornerstone of Chinese foreign policy.  As the number one trading partner of Africa  China would continue to support efforts by African countries in combating tuberculosis and malaria.  Turning to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa  he noted that China was deeply worried about the deterioration of the outbreak  adding that his country would send additional assistance  including 60 ambulances and numerous units of personal protective gear.  China stood with West Africa until we win final victory on Ebola  and would continue to support NEPAD and the African Union's Agenda 2063. KODJO MENAN (Togo)  aligning with Malawi  said tackling malaria remained a major health problem.  The most prevalent parasitic disease in morbidity and mortality  it targeted children under five and pregnant women.  Forty percent of children under five years of age in Malawi were affected  and 4 per cent of deaths country-wide were linked to the disease.  Togo had implemented a strategic plan to eliminate malaria  with special medicines  combination treatments  and the distribution of insecticidal nets to the most vulnerable groups.  This September four million nets were distributed.  He asked for more international partner involvement to provide 80 per cent coverage in net use  protection of pregnant women  and rapid care for confirmed malaria cases.  The emergence of Ebola had hampered efforts to combat malaria.  His country fervently hoped that there would be solidarity in response to Ebola which would translate into aid in people  expertise  and equipment. ELIPHAS CHINYONGA (Zambia) said malaria remained a major public health concern in Zambia and the Government strongly believed a malaria-fee Zambia was possible.  To reach that goal  it had established the national health policy and the more targeted National Strategic Plan for Malaria.  That plan included various strategies to fight the disease  such as waiving import taxes on the mosquito nets and chemicals that helped control the disease  and increased budget allocations for targeted programmes.  As a result  Zambia had made remarkable reductions in incidents of malaria.  The strategic plan  which covered 2011 to 2015  also aimed to use community structures to help victims.  Community health workers were critical to ensure access to health care and provide holistic and integrated management of diseases.  The contribution of community leaders and opinion makers was also essential.  Zambia was also working on international and regional initiatives  such as the Southern Africa regional network and the joint commemoration of Southern African Development Community (SADC) Malaria Week  to prevent and control the disease. JEREMIAH NYAMANE KINGSLEY MAMABOLO (South Africa) said that his Government championed an initiative to fast-track some important projects of the Programme for Infrastructure for Development by identifying and addressing blockages  missing links and choke-points.  A progress was being made in closing the missing link of the trans-Saharan highway covering 4 500 kilometers between Algeria and Nigeria.  About $40 million had been secured towards its continued construction  which was expected to be completed in 2016.  The optic-fiber component of the same project had seen substantial progress  with 60 per cent completed.  Progress was being made in other projects  such as the navigational route between Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea and along the North-South Corridor.  A key impediment was a lack of capacity in project preparation.  Projects had been identified and finance was generally waiting for bankable projects to emerge from the project “pipeline”.  The bottleneck was the ability to bring identified projects to the point of bankability.  Africa urgently needed support to close that gap.  The African Development Bank had launched an initiative to mobilize $100 billion for regional infrastructure projects  with a focus on addressing that key part of the project cycle.      YOSHIFUMI OKAMURA (Japan) noted three basic priorities:  infrastructure and human resource development were crucial for economic growth; agriculture needed to be developed beyond basic subsistence; and trade and investment in the private sector should be encouraged in addition to ODA.  Reaffirming that prolonged peace and stability were fundamental prerequisites for socioeconomic development in Africa  he noted that a loss of peace and stability could set back great strides in Africa's development  which would be a burden on the international community in the future.  Rapid action must be taken on conflict  and was also important in the health sector.  The emergence of Ebola gravely jeopardized well-being and must immediately be addressed.  On malaria  his Government welcomed significant progress  but remained concerned with the high burden the disease continued to place on a number of countries. AMIT NARANGV (India) said the needs of Africa must be at the centre of the post-2015 Development Agenda.  Scaled up investments in the region's economic and social infrastructure were necessary.  According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  almost 20 per cent of African countries were at high risk of debt distress  he said  stressing the significance of creating a multilateral framework for sovereign debt restructuring to make the international financial system more efficient  stable and predictable.  Urgent coordinated action was required by the international community to fight the Ebola outbreak.  India provided immediate financing to Sierra Leone  Liberia  and Guinea  offered $500 000 to the World Health Organization to fight the disease  and contributed $10 million to the Secretary-General's Fund for Ebola.  India's partnership with the region had grown by 31.8 per cent annually from 2005 to 2011  and its trade with Africa was estimated to be more than $72 billion in 2013-2014.  India had provided training and education to thousands of African students and experts.  India continued to commit to peacekeeping in Africa with over 6 500 Indian peacekeepers deployed there. OMAR NAKOA (Libya) said that NEPAD was one of the main instruments emphasizing the commitment of African leaders to advancing the continent through a real partnership contributing to international peace and security.  Despite progress made over the past years  the continent still faced many obstacles and challenges which prevented it from achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  In view of that  developed countries had to fulfil commitments made.  Further efforts should be made to increase agricultural production  and investment priorities must be reorganized.  The Ebola outbreak was a great danger attacking Africans  and the continent's modest capabilities could not contain it.  It was imperative and urgent that all efforts were mobilized to combat this epidemic.  Despite a bad security situation  his Government would like to work with African countries to move forward NEPAD.  KHALED BENHAMADI (Algeria)  aligning with the African Group  said that the NEPAD had produced encouraging results.  Algeria had championed the Trans-Sahara Highway and gas pipeline which would link Algeria and Nigeria  and had secured $40 million to finance the project's missing link covering more than 4 500 kilometres  allowing a 2016 completion.  The fibre-optic component linking Algeria  Niger and Nigeria was 60 per cent complete.  Significant progress had been made to implement the Comprehensive African Development Programme.  Of the 45 countries who had committed themselves  39 had adopted a national agriculture investment plan.  There were persistent challenges.  Sustained international support was needed  and he called on development partners to deliver on their commitments to Africa  the only region unlikely to meet the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.  TOMMO MONTHE (Cameroon)  associating himself with the African Group  said that two topics were crucial: infrastructure and industrialization.  The lack of infrastructure was a serious challenge which undermined Africa on the global market.  Industrialization was a powerful tool capable of generating productive jobs and decent work.  The enslaved nature of many African economies concentrated economic activity on the production of raw materials.  The link of that area with other parts of the economy was very fragile; that promoted inequalities.  But the recognition of that in the African Union's Agenda 2063 was reason for hope  and based on all of above  the strengthening of the industrial fabric should be supported.  A number of initiatives have been taken in his country  he said  enumerating them in a list which included agricultural initiatives and a training project for nurses and midwives in Africa.  Taking note of the view of the Secretary-General that debt forgiveness alone was no miracle cure for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)  he said that Africa's access to global markets and fair trade were important  and added his Government's welcome of the strengthening of regional coordination mechanisms for institutions working in Africa. IBRAHIM ASSANE MAYAKI  Chief Executive Officer of NEPAD  said that the Partnership was central to the continent's transformation efforts.  Premised on reforms of governance systems under the African Peer Review Mechanism  17 countries had been peer-reviewed.  As the technical body of the African Union  the NEPAD Agency focused on the strategic coordination of the implementation of the continent's priority programmes and projects.  He listed several programmes and initiatives NEPAD was behind  including the establishment of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme.  Turning to the topic of infrastructure  he noted action plans and strategies undertaken by NEPAD  including the Science  Technology and Innovation Strategy for Africa.  Key challenges still remaining  including in the field of health  the African Union would launch a new long-term strategy titled Agenda 2063 to address the commonality of challenges facing the continent.  The post-2015 development agenda should be the foundation for promoting coherence between regional and global efforts to achieve development effectiveness. DMITRY I. MAKSIMYCHEV (Russian Federation) said that Africa had engaged today on a path of economic modernisation and growth.  Significant positive changes had taken place.  His Government backed coordinated measures aimed at promoting sustainable development  and provided comprehensive assistance to Africa.  In April this year  a new policy had been affirmed in the field of promoting international development.  Trade and commercial ties were also being expanded.  The training of specialists and experts was important  and significant assistance in the field of health care was being given.  The spread of Ebola was cause for growing alarm  however.  Guided by principles of solidarity  his Government planned to send additional humanitarian aid to affected areas  consisting of drugs  experts  and other aid.  As a permanent Security Council member  the Russian Federation was making contributions to strategic policy lines for the international community.  RAYMOND SERGE BALÉ (Congo)  aligning with the African Group  said Africa had seen many initiatives and development programmes that were short lived.  The birth of NEPAD was a common vision for development in the continent.  He hailed progress made in the area of governance in Africa  and expressed legitimate pride with the peer review process.  Congo was one of the first States to conduct self-assessment as early as 2003  and was one of 13 African countries to make progress in all of the areas of self-assessment.  It had made progress in the area of security  human rights  human development and sustainable development.  But Africa faced new security challenges  in the form of narco-terrorism  activities of extremist groups like Boko Haram  and maritime piracy.  He called on the international community to reinforce its engagement against those scourges and on in the parties to the crisis in Central African Republic to return to the dialogues in Brazzaville.  His country supported the Transitional Government authorities  and the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA)  and firmly condemned any attacks on the peacekeepers.  He recalled the international mediator’s appeal for the international community to remain mobilised for the Central African Republic. OSAMA ABDELKHALEK MAHMOUD (Egypt) said that NEPAD represented Africa's inspiration to take matters into its own hands.  Crystallising Africa's vision on agriculture and food security  regional integration and infrastructure  human development and information and communication technology  NEPAD translated African priorities into specific programs and projects.  African priorities needed to be integrated into the post-2015 development agenda.  ODA should continue to constitute the backbone of financing for development.  Africa also needed the support of the international community for the recovery of illicit transferred assets.  The Ebola outbreak reminded the international community again of Africa's special needs  and $1 billion should be mobilized over the next six months in order to succeed in combating the disease.  Efforts to achieve sustainable peace and growth should be coupled with serious efforts to create  keep and build peace.  USMAN SARKI (Nigeria) associating with the African Group  said armed conflicts were the most significant challenges facing the continent today.  Nigeria noted the nexus established in the Secretary-General's report between peace  security and development.  Where conflicts broke out regional peace structures must be enabled to react on a timely basis  and protect civilians and other groups from the excesses of war.  Nigeria had always supported regional initiatives to address conflict.  Development challenges had long impacted Africa's capacity to respond to threats to peace.  The debilitating impacts of malaria had long held back Africa's development process.  The Ebola outbreak had compounded the situation in Africa.  The international community would have to face this threat together.  Rather than stigmatizing and isolating countries  the international community should show solidarity and compassion.  Nigeria had dispensed $3 million to the affected countries  and would continue to give the support needed.  The African Union and NEPAD had developed blueprints for infrastructure development.  The most important infrastructure gap in Africa today was in the power sector; only 24 per cent of Africa's population was reported to have access to a constant electricity supply. OMAR HILALE (Morocco)  aligning with the African Group  said that African States had shown their commitment as engines and catalysts for development.  But despite progress achieved to date  there were challenges.  Financial crises were one  and the recent Ebola crisis showed the extent to which it was necessary for the international community to continue to contribute.  Morocco had expressed its solidarity with countries impacted by this pandemic by the fact that Air Morocco continued to fly to affected areas  making sure they were not isolated.  Turning to issues of development  he noted that ODA should be strengthened.  The specific needs of Africa should be part of a post-2015 development program.  The promotion of investment and access to markets were key elements for the continued emergence of African States.  Underscoring the need for productive investment  he noted its role as catalyst  especially with regard to the eradication of poverty.  South-South cooperation had always been one of the pillars of his Government's foreign policy. HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia) aligning with ASEAN’s statement  welcomed the progress of the African countries in the last 10 years of implementation of the African Peer Review Mechanism  and expressed hope that more African countries would participate in the process in the future.  The growing trend of foreign direct investment flows into Africa had provided the foundation for better cooperation in the areas of peace and security  trade  investment  and holistic development.  With a total of $19.3 billion in investment in Africa  Malaysia was the third largest investor there in 2011 after the United States and France.  He acknowledged the difficulties Africa faced in achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015  and reaffirmed Malaysia's support to continue to be an active dialogue partner with the region under the South-South cooperation framework.  He reaffirmed Malaysia’s commitment to host a Smart Partnership Dialogue through the Langkawi International Dialogue  at a date to be announced.  The dialogue would be a good platform for Malaysia to engage with other African countries and to demonstrate Malaysia’s continued support for Africa’s economic development.  He expressed deep concern over the Ebola outbreak  and said his country had mobilized resources to ensure adequate humanitarian response on the ground in order to combat the outbreak effectively. Y. HALIT ÇEVIK (Turkey) said that at this crossroads of defining the post-2015 development agenda  a comprehensive discussion on how to achieve and finance Africa's sustainable development was important.  Addressing the conflicts on the continent would also serve development efforts.  Turkey supported African solutions to African problems.  When assuming the Group of 20 Presidency in December 2014  his Government would work for a more representative  fair and democratic global economic system that favoured all.  Deeply concerned about the Ebola outbreak  a humanitarian crisis which was affecting regional and global security  his Government would shortly announce additional financial assistance to help combat the outbreak. NEGASH KIBRET (Ethiopia) associating with the African Group’s statement  said the efforts of NEPAD and the support of partners to mobilize the required resources should be accorded the attention they deserved.  Africa alone would be unable to implement the 51 projects and programmes and the 16 national and regional priority infrastructure projects identified as quick wins for financing in the Programme for Infrastructure Development.  Ethiopia was aware that surpluses were available in the global economy and opportunities should not be missed to support Africa's development programs identified in NEPAD.  Ethiopia  as part of Sub-Saharan Africa  had made considerable progress in reducing malaria. More than 57 million nets had been distributed since 2005  and households targeted for indoor residual spraying had grown from 20 per cent in 2005 to over 80 per cent in 2013.  Confirmed malaria cases in 2011 declined by 66 per cent in children under the age of five  and malaria admissions and deaths fell by 81 per cent and 73 per cent respectively.  Ethiopia was looking forward to the support of the international community in technical and financial inputs to implement its new national strategy for malaria control and elimination for 2014-2020. JEANNE D'ARC BYAJE (Rwanda) said that everyone concurred that Africa was today the land of opportunities  and that there was a lot to celebrate.  The worst was behind us  she said  adding that it was time for all Africans to rise as one and seize the momentum towards a unified agenda.  Confronted with new challenges such as the outbreak of Ebola  food shortages  climate change and terrorism  a unified approach was even more necessary.  Agriculture would play a pivotal role in Africa's development.  Hundreds of intra-state conflicts were raging  and there was an urgent need to focus collectively on how to go beyond managing conflicts to investing in their prevention. CHRISTOPHE LOBRY-BOULANGER  a representative of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies  said the under-five mortality rate from malaria had been reduced by two thirds between 1990 and 2015.  Intervention mechanisms had saved an estimated 3.3 million lives globally.  But two African countries still accounted for about 40 per cent of worldwide malaria mortality.  He called for all parties to scale up research and development  and asked for support for the timely replacement of insecticide-treated nets in accordance with WHO recommendations.  His organization would continue to focus on social mobilization aimed at changing behaviour  supporting individual countries' ministries of health  empowering communities with education and treatment options  and embracing the adoption of new technologies such as social media to communicate health messages.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-17,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaspd.doc.htm-0,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. It was the world’s responsibility to ensure that the “fruits of the marvellous progress of science” benefitted the poor around the world  the Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) heard this morning. During the final day of the Committee’s annual debate on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space  delegates highlighted the importance of space technology for sustainable development as an important element for inclusion in the post-2015 agenda.  The representative of the Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See urged States to work together to ensure that space benefits did not become yet another cause of increasing economic and social inequality. Favouring an international code of conduct towards advancing a fairer and safer use of outer space  he said care must be taken to ensure that outer space technology did not become an instrument of dominion and a vehicle for imposing certain cultures and values on others. The representative of Pakistan said space was a crucial driver of socio-economic growth.  He went on to describe how his country benefitted from cooperation in its peaceful exploration and use  in such fields as agriculture  communication  conservation  disaster preparedness  and health.  Ukraine’s speaker sought a holistic approach to applying space science and technology to the core challenges of development.  In a position often repeated during the three-day debate  the representative of Nigeria underscored the importance of equal and non-discriminatory access to outer space for all States; that would aim at improving living conditions  regardless of a country’s scientific  technological  and economic development. In that vein  the representative of El Salvador emphasized the need for greater participation of least developed countries in efforts to ensure the peaceful uses of outer space and its support of sustainable development.  In that context  the country proposed declaring the realm a “zone of peace”. The United States  said its speaker  welcomed space-related confidence building and arms control proposals  as long as they met the criteria of equitability  and were consistent with the country’s national security interests. He was pleased to join the Russian Federation and China in co-sponsoring a resolution on transparency and confidence building in outer space.  Indeed  several delegates expressed the need for greater international cooperation and development of a code of conduct to prevent the militarization of outer space.  Also discussed were the risk of increased space debris and the role of space technology in mitigating natural disasters. Statements were also made by representatives of Ecuador  India  Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  South Africa  Colombia  Venezuela  Burkina Faso  United Arab Emirates  Republic of Korea  the Philippines  and Cuba. The representatives of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea spoke in exercise of right of reply. The Fourth Committee will meet again at 3 p.m. on Tuesday  21 October  to begin its consideration of questions relating to information. Background The Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) met this morning to conclude its annual debate on international cooperation in peaceful uses of outer space.  For background  see Press Release GA/SPD/561 of 16 October. Statements XAVIER LASSO MENDOZA (Ecuador) recognized the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) as the only international forum for the development of outer space law.  He fully supported its promotion of international cooperation to guarantee equal and true access for all States.  He supported promotion of space technology for sustainable development in line with the post-2015 agenda.  Ecuador expressed a specific interest in the role of space technology in connection with climate change and natural disasters.  He noted the need to speed up support for the United Nations Platform for Space-based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response (UN–SPIDER)  as well as for effective tools to prevent natural disasters.  His country  particularly vulnerable to earthquakes  and terrible floods  had already started three projects based on outer space technology to help protect Ecuador’s food supplies  with items such as a forecast model using space- and spectrum-based technology.  Pointing out the importance of current draft treaties on outer space  he said that an outer space arms race was a serious threat to peace and security  and that complying with existing norms was essential to preventing such a situation. V. SRINIVAS PRASAD (India)  acknowledging the recent significant achievements of various Member States in space endeavours  announced that his country had successfully placed its first inter-planetary probe in the Martian orbit last month.  Providing a broad overview of India’s space programme  he said it continued to integrate advances in technology and applications with national development goals.  Formal instruments of cooperation for peaceful uses of outer space were in place with 34 countries and three international organizations.  India continued to provide expertise and services to support developing countries in the application of space technology through capacity building.  The Centre for Space Science and Technology Education for Asia and the Pacific Region  affiliated with the United Nations and operating from India  had benefited more than 1 340 scholars from 53 countries.   NABEEL MUNIR (Pakistan)  underscoring the importance of space as a crucial driver for socio-economic growth  described how his country was benefiting from cooperation in peaceful exploration and use of outer space  in such fields as agriculture  communication  conservation  disaster preparedness  and health.  The country’s recently launched Space Education and Awareness Programme organized short courses for industry professionals and Government officials  and collaborated with academia for student projects.  Supporting the positive outcomes of the working group on Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities  he stressed the need for transparency and confidence-building measures  consistent with national interests  and as a means to achieving enhanced space safety and security.  Consultations on an international code of conduct should be pursued in an inclusive  universal  and participatory manner.  Much of the existing space debris was the result of activities of space-faring nations and  given the lack of resources in developing countries  those nations had a moral responsibility to assist new entrants in the implementation of the guidelines of COPUOS.  Pakistan was neither using nor planning to use nuclear power sources applications  he said  stressing that their use should comply with the global regulatory regime and applicable safety norms. KIM IN RYONG (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) recalled that the United States and other hostile elements had made an issue of the peaceful launch of his country’s satellite  trying to block its peaceful development of the outer space.  Despite many sanctions  his country had been able to develop and use artificial satellites that were essential to furthering its economy.  His country was a State member of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty  and its latest satellite had been registered with that Treaty  as required.  The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea had increased funding for the education and training of outer-space scientists to raise promising experts in the field.  He stressed the importance of strengthening international exchange to ensure that technological achievements served the common aspiration for prosperity. Finally  he addressed what he called the United States-led militarization of  outer space with the establishment of its missile defence system  stating that it was stirring up an arms race in outer space.  Such a move should be condemned as it was an outrageous challenge to international law.  He called on the United Nations Member States to join in the efforts to build confidence and transparency in the exploration of outer space. YEHOR PYVOVAROV (Ukraine) said it was necessary to strengthen the strategic role of the Outer Space Committee and seek a holistic approach to enhancing coordination between Member States and the United Nations system in applying space science and technology to meet the challenges of development.  Regional and interregional cooperation and coordination the field were essential to assist States in developing their space capabilities  and contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  He called for greater transparency in space activities  information sharing among States  and compliance with provisions of international space law to secure the peaceful nature of space activities.  Urging all Member States to enhance international coordination and cooperation in disaster management and emergency response  he called for extended and affordable strategies to minimize the impact of space debris.  A single and comprehensive convention on space law was desirable to strengthen the global legal regime. MLUNGISI CEDRICK MBALATI (South Africa) said that the increase of space debris was a matter of concern due to the risk it posed to space systems  and the possibility of disrupting the space-based services on which everyone relied.  He noted the progress of the working group on the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities  and welcomed its proposed series of guidelines.  South Africa was committed to being a responsible user of outer space.  It joined the call for all nations to work together to preserving that environment for future generations.  His Government would ensure that all national  public  and private sector space activities were conducted in accordance with relevant international treaties.  In the domain of space law  the work of the legal subcommittee was vital to developing a shared understanding of the legal implications of the rapid development in the space arena.  South Africa was committed to utilizing outer space for peaceful purposes  and firmly believed that international cooperation was one of the best ways to preserve that realm for peaceful purposes.  In that  inter-regional cooperation also played role.  Thus  his Government  with all its African partners  was committed to ensuring that the benefits of space technology were extended to the rest of the African continent. KENNETH HODGKINS (United States) noted that the Outer Space Committee was exclusively focused on the peaceful uses of outer space  while other United Nations organs were considering the matter in the context of disarmament and security.  His country emphasized international cooperation  and was addressing the problem of space debris  while promoting best practices for sustainable use of space.  The United States welcomed space-related confidence building and arms control proposals  as long as they met the criteria of equitability  and were consistent with the United States’ national security interests. He was pleased to join the Russian Federation and China in co-sponsoring a resolution on transparency and confidence building in outer space.  Referring to the report of the Group of Governmental Experts  he said a United Nations inter-agency mechanism could provide a platform for the promotion and implementation of transparency and confidence building.  Also  recommendations for specific unilateral  bilateral  and multilateral  transparency and confidence building measures should be agreed.  He also suggested measures relevant to the long-term sustainability of space activities.  The Outer Space Committee’s legal subcommittee played a key role in establishing the primary Outer Space Treaties.  With those instruments in place  space exploration had flourished  thereby contributing to economic growth.  He welcomed the subcommittee’s multi-year work plan to review international mechanisms for cooperation in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space. DIANA LUCÍA RENGIFO (Colombia)  associating with Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR)  stressed the need to place space technologies in the service of the social and economic development.  It was essential to strengthen access to and use of space-derived knowledge in various dimensions of sustainable development  in the context of the post-2015 agenda.  Regional cooperation was central to harnessing space resources  she said  calling for the creation of mechanisms for information sharing that were relevant to her region.  The geo-stationary orbit was a limited resource and should be used in an equitable and fair manner  with particular consideration to geography. HENRY ALFREDO SUÁREZ MORENO (Venezuela) reaffirmed that outer space must be preserved and used in an equitable manner and in accordance with international instruments.  He said the legal principle governing the use of outer space and protecting the right of equal access by all States was extremely important; therefore  he rejected all limits on space-based technology transfer to developing countries.  He recalled that the geo-stationary orbit was a limited resource that should be used based on rationalized access.  The current legal framework should be strengthened to avoid the militarization of outer space.  He welcomed the proposed treaty developed by China and the Russian Federation  and regretted that it had not been adopted  owing to the opposition of some Member States.  His country had promoted technology independence to achieve the well-being of its people.  He described agreements with Argentina  France  and China to develop space technology. Finally  he reiterated his country’s commitment to the Outer Space Committee  convinced of the need to guarantee that realm was used for peaceful purposes only. FILATENI COULIBALY (Burkina Faso) said the current generation bore the responsibility of making rational use of resources  including outer space.  Stressing his country’s commitment to the peaceful use of outer space  he urged the Outer Space Committee to work towards reducing the risk of militarization of space.  Further development of space laws in that regard was important.  Describing his country’s experience in the knowledge sharing of space-based tools for land security  he said the initiative would have an application for the broader social and economic development of the country.  Open international cooperation would promote the development of legal instruments to ensure sustainable and peaceful use of space.  It was indispensable to strengthen confidence among nations  he said  calling on the United Nations to create a database for use in natural disasters. AHMED ABDELRAHMAN AHMED ALMAHMOUD (United Arab Emirates) urged expansion of the peaceful use of outer of space to achieve sustainable development.  The importance of international cooperation was key  and all should benefit by using space technology to prevent natural disasters.  Conferences held by the United Nations over the last two decades had been extremely important  and he praised the efforts of the Outer Space Committee and its two subcommittees.  He favoured a code of conduct for peaceful use of outer space  to ensure the implementation of international  law-based space activities  in the spirit of transparency.  He also urged the international community to pay attention to the problem of space debris. Nationally  he said his country had established the Emirate Space Agency to work for the next seven years on activities such as sending satellites into space and promoting space exploration activities.  His country was determined to continue its development in science  space and technology  and to renew its commitment to the United Nations for the peaceful use of outer space. ANTHONY BOSAH (Nigeria)  stressing that space activities were becoming increasingly central to the lives of global citizens  said meeting development goals and rising challenges called for innovative measures  which advancement in space technology afforded.  Nigeria was committed to engaging with private  regional  and international space-faring entities in efforts geared towards and promoting peaceful uses of outer space.  The country’s national space agency was established to pursue the development and application of space science and technology  for the socio-economic benefit of the nation.  He underscored the importance of equal and non-discriminatory access to outer space for all States aimed at improving living conditions  regardless of their scientific  technological  and economic development.  Outer space was the common heritage of mankind  and Nigeria attached utmost importance to preventing an arms race there. SANG-BEOM LIM (Republic of Korea) said that  considering the advantageous impact of space science on mankind as a whole  maintaining space for peaceful purposes and preserving it as a usable domain was incumbent upon all.  The Republic of Korea  as a State party to all major conventions on outer space  carried out all of its activities in that area in a peaceful  transparent  and safe manner  and in line with relevant norms.  Supporting efforts to develop an international code of conduct on outer space to ensure greater safety  he stressed the needed for strengthening transparency and confidence-building measures.  Highlighting his country’s accomplishments in sharing space-related benefits  he said the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea continued to abuse the right to peaceful uses of outer space  as a pretext to developing its ballistic missile programmes  which relevant Security Council texts clearly opposed. LIBRAN N. CABACTULAN (Philippines)  aligning with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  reaffirmed the importance of space science and technology application in understanding the modern world  and advancing concrete efforts to the benefit of all mankind.  That would also further implementation of a post-2015 agenda.  However  outer space should be used peacefully and sustainably.  He affirmed the freedom of all States to access and exploration  and renewed his country’s commitment to the demilitarization of outer space.  He noted a few observations from the report of the Outer Space Committee  hailing it as a unique forum for discussions between the States involved in space activities.  The Committee  also  was poised to play a large role in the field of global security  he said  adding that space-based information was of vital importance to prevent and mitigate natural disasters.  The current legal framework  however  was not adequate to prevent the placement of weapons on outer space.  He reiterated his country’s position that outer space should be rules-based  and he acknowledged efforts made to develop a deeper understanding of the safe and secure use of outer space.  He also stressed the need for discussions on an international code of conduct to enable it to gain traction. RUBÉN IGNACIO ZAMORA RIVAS (El Salvador) stressed the need for greater participation of least developed countries in efforts to ensure the peaceful uses of outer space  and harness it in support of sustainable development.  In that context  his country proposed declaring the realm a “zone of peace”.  Emphasizing the urgency of a comprehensive  multilateral code of conduct  he said it should be developed on four pillars: commonality  equality  peaceful purposes  and international cooperation.  As space was the common heritage of humanity  he urged the world community to work together to make that a reality. DAVID FORÉS RODRÍGUEZ (Cuba) recognized the work of the Outer Space Committee  and reiterated its appeal to the international community to stop the threat of militarization of outer space.  The development of international legislation was incomplete on that aspect  and Cuba  thus  urged all Member States to discuss such an instrument.  The Outer Space Committee in fact  should work with the Conference on Disarmament to develop a strong framework.  It should also enhance existing legal instruments to guarantee the peaceful and just use of outer space.  Technological progress resulted in the commercialization of outer space; however  the geo-stationary orbit was a limited resource and must be protected.  Cuba had signed a joint declaration with the Russian Federation for the non-placement of weapons in outer space and hoped other countries would join the effort. Despite the cruel international blockade  he said Cuba had further developed its outer space programme.  Early warning was very important to his country; hence  he emphasized the need to perfect weather forecasting  in order to mitigate the impacts of natural disasters.  The full autonomy of space activities by all States was impossible  and it was therefore all the more urgent to have international cooperation in information exchange  especially for the developing countries.  In closing  he voiced his country’s support for the Outer Space Committee’s work in raising awareness in order to reach the Millennium Development Goals. BERNARDITO CLEOPAS AUZA  representative of the Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See  said that  since the earliest days of human history  humanity had looked to the sky with wonder  longing to understand celestial realities and their meaning in relation to humanity itself.  Because of the foundational questions it had always raised  the exploration of the universe had also deepened understanding of faith and its rapport with science.  The world’s responsibility was to ensure that the fruits of the marvellous progress of science benefitted the poor around the world.  While there were constraints to universal access to the benefits  States must work together to guard against yet another cause of increasing economic and social inequalities.  The international code of conduct for outer space activities represented a positive step towards furthering a fairer and safer use of outer space  and averting a new  grave threat to international peace and security.  Care must be taken  as well  to ensure that outer space technology did not become an instrument of dominion and a vehicle to impose certain cultures and values on others. Right of Reply The representative of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  speaking in exercise of right of reply  said his country’s satellite programme was peaceful and fell within its sovereign rights.  The misrepresentation of its satellite launch was responsible for the imposition of sanctions  he said  rejecting the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. Exercising his right of reply  the representative of the Republic of Korea said the Security Council itself had characterized the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s satellite programme as a threat to international peace and security. Taking the floor for a second time  the representative of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea said his country would continue to launch satellites as part of its national development efforts. Next  the representative of the Republic of Korea said it was regrettable that the representative of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea had stated his refusal to abide by Security Council resolutions  which were binding for all Member States. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-16,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gashc4104.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Taking a strong stand on a range of issues from prisoners’ rights to protecting cultural property  the Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) sent six draft resolutions on crime prevention  criminal justice and international drug control to the General Assembly today  unanimously approving the texts  one on the elimination of violence against children in the area of crime prevention and criminal justice Also by that text  the General Assembly would strongly condemn all acts of violence against children  reaffirm the duty of the State to protect children from all forms of violence in both public and private settings  and call for the elimination of impunity  including by investigating and prosecuting  with due process  and punishing all perpetrators.  The Assembly would  by the draft text  urge Member States to take all necessary and effective measures to prevent and respond to all forms of violence against children who came in contact with the justice system as victims  witnesses or alleged or recognized offenders  and to provide for consistency in their laws and policies. By the terms of a text on minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners  the Assembly would recommend to Member States to reduce prison overcrowding  promote increased access to justice and legal defence mechanisms  reinforce alternatives to imprisonment and support rehabilitation and reintegration programmes.  Other draft texts approved without a vote addressed international cooperation in criminal matters; international guidelines for crime prevention and criminal justice responses with respect to trafficking in cultural property and other related offences; follow-up to the Twelfth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and preparations for the Thirteenth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice; and on the special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem to be held in 2016. The Committee also heard the introduction of four draft resolutions related to social development  and one on crime prevention and criminal justice. During its morning meeting  the Committee continued its discussion on the rights of children  with Maarit Kohonen Sheriff  Deputy Head of Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) New York  presenting two reports on child  early and forced marriages.  Emphasizing that the practice had negative effects on women and girls  exposing them to exploitation  she stressed the importance of including the elimination of child  early and forced marriage as a specific target in the post-2015 agenda. Regional representatives and delegates then told the Committee of their national and global efforts along with the challenges ahead.  Echoing a common concern  a representative of Costa Rica  speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  said poverty and inequality were among the roots of many harsh realities children faced  including trafficking  rape  abuse and pornography.  Education was a key enabler of human and social development and a critical means to rectifying gross inequalities  said a representative of Barbados  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  voicing a view shared throughout the debate. Also participating in that debate were representatives of Myanmar (on behalf of Association of South-East Asian Nations and in a national capacity)  Zimbabwe (on behalf of Southern African Development Community)  Italy  United States  Russian Federation  Cuba  Norway  India  Japan  Switzerland  Peru  Thailand  Morocco  Brazil  Dominican Republic  Singapore  Liechtenstein  Lao People’s Democratic Republic  Bolivia (on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China)    United Republic of Tanzania  Mongolia  Uganda  Syria  Senegal  Slovenia  United Arab Emirates  Canada  Mexico  Nicaragua  Iraq  Colombia  Ethiopia  South Africa  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Honduras  Chile  Libya  Saudi Arabia and Brunei Darussalam  as well as the European Union. The Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Friday  17 October to continue its general discussions on the advancement of women and on rights of children. Background The Third Committee met this morning to continue its consideration of the promotion and protection of the rights of children.  For background  see Press Release GA/SHC/4103.  Before the Committee were two notes by the Secretary-General containing  respectively  the report of High Commissioner for Human Rights on preventing and eliminating child  early and forced marriage (document A/69/166) and the summary report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the panel discussion on preventing and eliminating child  early and forced marriage (document A/69/165). It also heard the introduction of four draft resolutions on social development: Implementation of the outcome of the World Summit for Social Development and of the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly (document A/C.3/69/L.11); Realizing the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed upon development goals for persons with disabilities towards 2015 and beyond (document A/C.3/69/L.10); World Youth Skills Day (document A/C.3/69/L.13); and Literacy for life: shaping future agendas (document A/C.3/69/L.9). With regard to crime prevention  criminal justice and international drug control  a draft resolution the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (document A/C.3/69/L.17) was introduced. The Committee was then expected to take action on seven draft resolutions: Follow-up to the Twelfth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and preparations for the Thirteenth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (document A/C.3/69/L.2); Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (document A/C.3/69/L.3); International cooperation in criminal matters (document A/C.3/69/L.4); United Nations Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Children in the Field of Crime Prevention (document A/C.3/69/L.5); Rule of law  crime prevention and criminal justice in the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015 (document A/C.3/69/L.6); International Guidelines for Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Responses with Respect to Trafficking in Cultural Property and Other Related Offences (document A/C.3/69/L.7); and on the Special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem to be held in 2016 (document A/C.3/69/L.8). Statements MAARIT KOHONEN SHERIFF  Deputy Head of the New York Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) New York  presented two reports: a study on preventing and elimination child  early and forced marriage (document A/69/166); and a summary report of the panel discussion on child  early and forced marriages held during the twenty-sixth session of the Human Rights Council (document A/69/165).  With those in mind  she said the practice had a negative impact on the capacity of women and girls to fully realize their rights.  It also exposed women and girls to violence and exploitation due to differences in age and power relations between them and their husbands. Targeted action was necessary to identify communities in which girls were at high risk of child  early and forced marriage  she said.  There should also be “comprehensive  age-appropriate  culturally relevant education” for women and girls regarding sexuality  sexual and reproductive health and rights  gender equality and life-skills training. Yet for such measures to be effective  States must ensure coordination among stakeholders  including between government bodies at the national and local levels  civil society organizations  such as women’s groups  religious community leaders  national human rights institutions  United Nations agencies and other relevant actors.  Traditional and religious leaders  as well as men and boys  could play an important role.  Concluding  she stressed that it was important to include the elimination of child  early and forced marriage as a specific target in the post-2015 development agenda. ADRIANA MURILLO RUIN (Costa Rica)  speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  said global averages often masked growing inequalities with regard to key indicators  as millions of children were affected by socio-political crisis  armed conflict  natural disaster and extreme poverty.  Addressing the disproportionate concentration of children living in extreme poverty and reducing persistent disparities in health  education and other crucial child well-being indicators  she said the international community needed to ensure that the post-2015 development agenda included the poorest and most vulnerable children around the world  including those with disabilities  indigenous children  children of African descent and migrant children. Regarding those with disabilities and indigenous children  she said that due attention must be paid to their vulnerabilities  the full enjoyment of their rights and meeting their basic needs as a matter of priority.  On migrant children  she called on transit and destination countries to effectively promote and protect their human rights and fundamental freedoms and address irregular migration from a humanitarian perspective.  On children involved in trafficking  smuggling  sale for purpose of sexual exploitation  rape  abuse  sale of organs  sexual tourism  pornography and cybercrime  she said those situations were linked to poverty  social inequality  discrimination  migration  insecurity and organized crime.  She concluded by calling for the causes of those circumstances to be tackled.   JULIETTE ROSITA RILEY (Barbados)  speaking on behalf of Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  said that as countries that had emerged from slavery and colonialism  members recognized that education was a key enabler of human and social development and a critical means to rectify gross inequalities.  Aware of the transformative role played by education  she continued  the majority of countries in the region had achieved universal access to primary education  almost halving the number of children out of school between 2000 and 2011.  Despite progress made  daunting challenges persisted in terms of continuing to provide adequate social safety nets for the most vulnerable of its citizens within the framework of austerity programmes  which often demanded rollbacks in health  education and other public services. Turning to the issue of adolescent pregnancy  she said that girls who became pregnant at 15 or younger were more likely to experience premature delivery  health problems with their newborns  an increased likeliness of newborn death and interruption of their education.  Initiatives to tackle that issue included access to quality sexual and reproductive healthcare services  age-appropriate  accurate  comprehensive education on human sexuality  social protection mechanisms and common legal standards across the region concerning the age of marriage. KYAW TIN (Myanmar)  speaking on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  said the post-2015 development agenda presented a golden opportunity to double efforts to overcome inequities affecting the poorest and most vulnerable children.  Noting that disparities and inequities of development growth had affected children  especially in least developed and developing countries  the disproportionate concentration of extreme poverty among children remained a huge barrier to the accomplishment of children’s rights. Turning to protecting children against violence  he said that ASEAN leaders were making tremendous efforts  the most recent of which had been the adoption of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women and Elimination of Violence against Children.  Reflecting the group’s collective efforts to strengthen legal and policy frameworks and institutional capacity  he said  the Declaration also outlined a roadmap to develop effective strategies to eliminate harmful practices that perpetuated gender stereotyping and violence against women and children.  Concluding  he reaffirmed the group’s commitment to continue prioritizing the welfare of its children  who represented the future of the region’s continued peace and prosperity.    CHARLES MSOSA (Malawi)  speaking on behalf of the African Group  said that political instability  economic crisis and climate change made it difficult for members to attend to the rights of the child.  Children in armed conflicts had witnessed acts of military brutality and had been denied the chance to enjoy life in peace.  Welcoming partnership agreements between the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict and the African Union  he added that the well-being of children depended on the well-being of their communities.  Therefore  a family-centred approach was necessary to ensure children’s rights.  Child welfare was at the core of human social development and African States had committed themselves individually and collectively to the rights of the child. Turning to child marriage  he said governments and the African Union were engaged in advocacy and awareness-raising.  The African Group believed that child marriage led to exploitation and a lack of participation in economic opportunities.  The international community should continue to coordinate efforts  including through the allocation of funds  to end all forms of violence against children.  Given that many African children remained vulnerable to poverty  hunger  disease and climate change  the sustainable development framework should pay due attention to their rights. Speaking in his national capacity  he said that the Government of Malawi was considering passing a law on marriage that set the minimum age to 18 for girls and boys  thereby putting an end to the practice of child and early marriages. FREDERICK MUSIIWA MAKAMURE SHAVA (Zimbabwe)  speaking on behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  said members would join other States in celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  He also congratulated the State of Palestine on its accession to the Convention as the 194th State Party.  In his region  poverty remained the underlying cause for all forms of vulnerability for children.  That was why many children continued to struggle to enjoy the most basic rights  such as education and health  and economic and social advancement opportunities.  Against that backdrop  he said  SADC members had designed various policies to expand access to education for all. With regard to health  despite some progress  infant and under-five mortality rates continued to be a matter of deep concern.  Even though member countries had made significant progress in reducing mother-to-child HIV transmission through various interventions  he said protecting and promoting the rights of children had continued to face challenges as a result of the negative legacy of the HIV/AIDS epidemic  resulting in significant increases to the number of orphans and vulnerable children and youth in the region.  Concluding  he reiterated the group’s commitment to promote and protect the rights of children in the region  welcoming strategic partnerships with all relevant stakeholders.   EVA CHARLOTTA SCHLYTER  of the European Union Delegation  said that her group  together with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Countries (GRULAC)  would be introducing the annual resolution on the rights of the child during the Committee’s current session.  The post-2015 development agenda needed to respond to new challenges and tackle issues of global concern that had not been sufficiently covered by the Millennium Development Goals.  Further  strong accountability mechanisms were necessary to track progress.  The European Union Agenda for the Rights of the Child  she added  focused on a number of concrete priorities  such as a child-friendly justice and the protection of children in vulnerable situations. Millions of children around the world  she continued  bore the burden of war and its atrocities.  The European Union welcomed the Organization’s attention to children living through armed conflict and supported all ongoing efforts to fight impunity and address persistent perpetrators.  Her group also supported the Children  Not Soldiers campaign  jointly initiated with UNICEF  which aimed to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children by government forces in conflicts by 2016.  The European Union also strongly welcomed the General Assembly’s landmark resolution banning the practice of female genital mutilation. SEBASTIANO CARDI (Italy) acknowledged the progress made in advancing the rights of the child  yet noted the persisting challenges.  Given the scope and complexity involved in protecting the rights of the child  he called for a coordinated and integrated response by the international community  which applied in particular  to the United Nations campaign “Children  not soldiers”.  The same approach was needed  he continued  when dealing with children with disabilities  so that they could integrate effectively and with dignity into the life cycle of their communities.  Raising awareness and creating legal frameworks were not enough  he added.  Instead  action was needed to provide every child with the knowledge  skills  security and safety needed to determine his or her path in life. CAROL HAMILTON (United States) said her country was party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its two optional protocols  and was committed to protecting the rights of the child  inside and outside its borders.  The Government was expanding access to high quality education for children from low-income families and the Affordable Healthcare Act was lowering the cost of children’s health care.  As the Secretary-General’s report indicated  the global under-five mortality rate had almost been halved.  However  the international community had been horrified by the images of “the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS)” rounding up young girls and selling them as sex slaves.  The children of Syria continued to suffer physical and psychological pain under a brutal regime  she said.  Being born a girl should not mean being forced into an early marriage.  When adolescent girls were empowered  it benefited everyone because they grew up into agents for change.  “We have a lot to learn from our children ” she concluded  adding that the international community must do more to leave them the world they deserved. NIKOLAI RAKOFSKY (Russian Federation) said his country was fully dedicated to compliance with the Convention  as it was a universal guideline for protecting children’s rights.  There had been a global trend in violence against children  he said  adding that his country welcomed the effort of international community towards the promotion and protection of their rights.  However  the Russian Federation was concerned about children in the south eastern part of Ukraine who were suffering from mass violations of human rights.  Stressing the destruction of infrastructure  kindergartens  hospitals  schools and orphanages in that area  he called upon the Ukrainian delegation to engage in dialogue. JAIRO RODRÍGUEZ HERNÁNDEZ (Cuba) said that without a balanced world order  it was impossible to reduce child mortality.  Lauding efforts made by UNICEF  he added that the protection of children’s rights was a big priority for Cuba  which was party to the Convention on the Rights of Children.  For its part  Cuba had started implementing child welfare policies thirty years before signing the Convention because those rights were enshrined in its constitution.  The Government allocated 50 per cent of its budget for education  health care and social services.  All Cuban children were vaccinated at birth and priority was given to early detection of congenital diseases.  Such feats were attained by the Cuban people despite the economic and trade blockade imposed by the United States.  Even though Cuba needed anti-viral medications to protect the health of its children  the North American companies that produced those medications said they could not trade with Cuba  he concluded. MAY-ELIN STENER (Norway) said the Convention on the Rights of the Child had inspired changes in laws  institutions and policies  which had improved the lives of many children around the world.  The Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi was a boost to the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention  sending an important message of support and recognition to those individuals around the world who worked tirelessly to defend the rights of children.  Despite efforts to create safe surroundings for all children  violence and abuse was taking place  she continued.  In that regard  she called for engagement at all levels  including community leaders and men  to end violence against children as well as child marriage. MAYANK JOSHI (India) said that his country was home to nearly 472 million children  20 per cent of all the world’s children.  The Indian constitution provided children with a range of services  including free and compulsory education for children up to age 14  and there was nearly universal enrolment for primary education.  The Government’s current focus was on the expansion of secondary education and its accessibility to girls.  Further  the innovative “Mother & Child” tracking system leveraged information technology for ensuring the delivery of a full spectrum of health care services to pregnant women and immunization services to children up to age five.  The Government had also undertaken legislative and policy measures to ban sex-selective abortion and child marriage.  Further  India remained strongly committed to the eradication of all forms of child labour  he said  noting that recent amendments to law prescribed stringent punishment to combat human trafficking  including the sale of children. ARINO YAGUCHI (Japan) said that Japan was working tirelessly to protect and promote the rights of children.  Because so many of them  especially girls  were not permitted or able to attend school  the country had implemented a number of projects aimed at the improvement of these “unbearable conditions”.  In Nigeria  where Boko Haram had abducted girls  Japan contributed $855 000 toward health care and psycho-social support for victims and communities.  The country had also joined efforts to eliminate the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict  extending approximately $76 million over the past five years to support their reintegration into society.  In response to the Ebola outbreak  Japan had sent experts to the World Health Organization (WHO) and had recently pledged an additional $40 million in assistance to international organizations combatting the disease.  CHRISTINE LÖW (Switzerland)  calling on Member States that that had not yet ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child to do so  said that it was necessary to pursue efforts to ensure that children were informed of their rights.  Promoting education  changing social norms  and giving children access to legal remedies were all crucial steps towards ending violence against them.  Children were especially vulnerable in prison  she added  informing the Committee of the World Congress on Juvenile Justice  to take place in Geneva  Switzerland in January 2015.  In recent months  Switzerland had bolstered its commitment to protecting children recruited by regular armed forced and non-State armed groups. WALTER HABICH MORALES (Peru) said that his country had made significant progress in the protection of child and adolescent rights.  Its Action Plan 2012-2021 was a framework that guided the country’s work in that matter with a focus on reducing child mortality  increasing access to education and diminishing violence against children.  Peru also had a food programme to ensure that children were given sustainable  healthy  locally produced food from the time they entered school until age 13.  Reducing child labour and building on achievements made in education were other priority areas  he said  noting that the child and adolescents office in Peru was decentralized and brought civil society organizations together in common efforts.  In closing  he said his country would continue to work with the international community to improve the rights of children. CHAYAPAN BAMRUNGPHONG (Thailand) said his country had tried to uphold the rights of children based on long-standing commitments set forth in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and protocols on the promotion and protection of children’s rights.  As a member of United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Executive Board  he continued  Thailand aimed at enhancing cooperation between the Fund and Member States in humanitarian situations  as well as universal access to education and healthcare for children.  Further  he said that the issue of violence against children was a priority to the Government  which had actively engaged in efforts to eradicate that problem.  In conclusion  he underlined that Thailand had advocated for the inclusion of combatting violence against children in the post-2015 development agenda  which must go beyond basic education and healthcare  and ensure that children enjoyed freedom from fear.   ABDERRAZZAK LAASSEL (Morocco) said the protection of children’s rights was key to strengthening social cohesion and protecting family unity.  Despite challenges in protecting children from abuse and ensuring proper living conditions within society  Government had a continuous commitment to their rights and fighting violence against them.  For its part  Morocco had undertaken measures and reforms and made commitments at both national and global levels.  In that regard  the Government’s two main priorities were reducing disparities among children and equitable access to education and health.  The Government also established scholarship programme to ensure children’s enrolment in primary school. ANTONIO DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil) said the Convention’s twenty-fifth anniversary offered an opportunity to reflect on progress achieved and challenges remaining in protecting children and overcoming inequality.  Stressing that women and children constituted the majority of affected groups living in poverty  Brazil was a strong advocate for the inclusion of children’s rights as an integral component of the post-2015 agenda.  The number of children separated from their families due to conflict  migration or extreme poverty was on the rise  he said  calling upon Member States to enhance their efforts in the care and protection of children within the post-2015 framework.  Saluting Nobel Peace Prize winners Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi  he said “the award honoured many more Malalas who exist in all our countries but have not been visible or received the recognition they deserve.”  Concluding  he highlighted the need to build a set of goals that could be easily understood and translated into concrete action by decision makers all over the world. MILDRED GUZMÁN MADERA (Dominican Republic)  noting that her country recently ratified the Convention’s optional protocol on the involvement children in armed conflicts  said the instrument’s twenty-fifth anniversary was a great opportunity to consider the shortcomings in the fight to protect the rights of the child.  For its part  the Dominican Republic had established a solidarity programme to fight poverty.  Other national programmes aimed at enhancing literacy and reforming education because the latter was “the best tool for our children”.  The Office of the First Lady in her country had been focusing on the social protection of children and had helped to create a centre for children suffering from Down syndrome  cerebral palsy and other conditions.  In closing  she said the Dominican Republic was also an active partner in various regional initiatives committed to eradicating child labour and trafficking. PAO JIA YU (Singapore) said that investing in and nurturing children to their fullest potential was not only an issue of child rights but was also an imperative for the survival of her country.  Unfortunately  bullying among children was a serious issue  as 58 per cent of children in Singapore between 8 and 17 had been bullied.  Her country also had the second highest rate in the world of online bullying of youth.  Singapore took the mental health of its children seriously  and strove to provide a platform for children to develop and flourish through an accessible  affordable and high-quality education system.  In closing  she cited Nelson Mandela  who once said that “history will judge us by the difference we make in the everyday lives of children.” KATHRIN NESCHER (Liechtenstein) said that her country condemned the unspeakable violence committed by Boko Haram and believed that the Security Council should enhance its efforts to ensure accountability and make full and productive use of the tools available to it.  Furthermore  the Council should enhance its cooperation with international tribunals and consider referring situations to the International Criminal Court.  Protecting children from violence was a moral and legal imperative  she said.  One of the lessons from the Millennium Development Goals process had shown was that despite progress  countries affected by violence tended to lag behind in efforts towards achieving targets.  Therefore  her country reiterated support for the proposed sustainable development goal 16  especially the proposal for target 16.2  which called for an end to abuse  exploitation  trafficking and all forms of violence and torture against children. SU LAY NYO (Myanmar)  speaking in her national capacity  said it was time to reflect the progress made since the adoption of the Convention.  Myanmar’s ratification to the Convention and signing of its Optional Protocol on the sale of children  child prostitution and child pornography  she said  was a true reflection of her Government’s commitment to promoting and protecting the rights of all children in the country.  Poverty was one of the main factors blocking children’s access to education  which perpetuated a negative cycle.  In that regard  the Government had signed an agreement with the World Bank Group and the Government of Australia that aimed to provide millions of students with a quality education in better financed schools with financial support.  Concluding  she urged Member States to work together to promote and protect the rights of the child and enhance their support of developing countries to save the children through reducing poverty. KHIANE PHANSOURIVONG (Lao People’s Democratic Republic)  aligning his delegation with the statement delivered on behalf of the ASEAN  said that children made up 50 per cent of the total population of the country.  With that in mind  his Government attached great importance to the protection of the rights of the child and was implementing policies and strategies to deal with human trafficking and provide food and nutrition to children.  His country also believed in strengthening institutions  improving cross-sector collaboration and had established the National Commission for Mother and Child  an inter-agency body responsible for monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  In addition  a juvenile chamber had been created in the court system to deal with cases involving children  he concluded. Introduction of Draft Resolutions The Committee heard the introduction of four draft resolutions relating to social development and one relating to crime prevention. On behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  Bolivia’s delegate introduced draft texts on the Implementation of the outcome of the World Summit for Social Development and of the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly (document A/C.3/69/L.11) and on World Youth Skills Day (document A/C.3/69/L.13). A representative of the United Republic of Tanzania then introduced a draft text on realizing the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed upon development goals for persons with disabilities towards 2015 and beyond (document A/C.3/69/L.10). Following that  Mongolia’s representative introduced a draft text on Literacy for life (document A/C.3/69/L.9). A representative of Uganda  on behalf of the Group of African States  presented a draft on the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (document A/C.3/69/L.17). Action on Texts The Committee then took action on seven draft resolutions relating to crime prevention  criminal justice and international drug control  recommended by the Economic and Social Council for adoption by the General Assembly. Acting without a vote  it approved the following four draft texts: Follow-up to the Twelfth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and preparations for the Thirteenth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (document A/C.3/69/L.2); Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (document A/C.3/69/L.3); and International cooperation in criminal matters (document A/C.3/69/L.4).  Also without a vote  it approved draft texts on International Guidelines for Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Responses with Respect to Trafficking in Cultural Property and Other Related Offences (document A/C.3/69/L.7) and on the Special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem to be held in 2016 (document A/C.3/69/L.8). Speaking before the Committee took action on a draft resolution on United Nations Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Children in the Field of Crime Prevention (document A/C.3/69/L.5)  a representative of Singapore said that the Government would implement the text’s recommendations  while bearing in mind national obligations.  That draft text was then approved without a vote. Thailand’s representative  as the main sponsor of the draft resolution on Rule of law  crime prevention and criminal justice in the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015 (document A/C.3/69/L.6)  asked to defer the action in order to correct a typographical error.  The Committee agreed to defer action on that draft text. The Committee then returned to its general discussion on children’s rights. MONIA AL-SALEH (Syria) said it had been more than three years since Syrian children had been suffering from the violence of extremist and terrorist groups supported by the Arab world and other States.  Those jihadist groups were planting radical ideas in the minds of male children and taking the innocence of girls to satisfy their needs.  Further  she continued  Syrian children were subjected to brainwashing with ideas of violence and terrorism against their homelands.  Turning to the refugee camps in neighbouring countries  she said Turkey was not a safe refuge for Syrian children due to reported cases of rape  trafficking and child recruitment by terrorist groups.  In addition  she criticized the representative of the United States for having double standards for being shocked by pictures of Iraqi children in conflict  yet she had no feelings for the Syrian children suffering from the violence of terrorist groups.  IBRAHIMA SORY SYLLA (Senegal) said his country was hopeful for a better future on the eve of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child  as 194 countries were now signatories.  Despite increasing numbers of States involved in the promotion and protection of the rights of children  he underlined the need to address the challenges children were suffering from conflict situations.  Further  poverty reduction must be tackled to better promote their rights.  Concluding  he said his country was deeply committed to dealing with children living with HIV/AIDS  a topic that must be taken into account in the post-2015 development agenda. MATEJ MARN (Slovenia) stressed the need to involve children in matters affecting them  including participating in national initiatives  including a round table discussion between his country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and children as well as the National Children Parliament.  Another example  he continued  was the participation of children in the area of school and peer mediation that was taking place in kindergarten  primary and secondary schools and already contributing to reducing violence and increasing the respect for human rights and diversity.  Recognizing the impact media coverage had on children  he said that specific guidelines had been developed to prevent the victimization of children in media.  SAEED AHMED ALSHAMSI (United Arab Emirates) said progress in the protection and promotion of the rights of children had not been equal in all States  calling for the incorporation of their rights in the post-2015 development agenda.  “We need to double our international and national efforts for creating a better world for children ” he said  calling for international efforts to protect them from harmful practices  such as child marriage and armed conflict.  At the national level  he said that education was obligatory and that there were penalties and sanctions against those who violated the law.  Support had also been given to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to provide vaccines to developing countries  he concluded. GREGORY DEMPSEY (Canada) noted the gains made since the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals.  However  he said  millions of children continued to lack access to health  millions of girls were still child brides and millions lived in conflict.  The conflicts in Syria and Iraq had displaced millions of children  exposing them to many kinds of violence  including sexual violence.  “A child is not a soldier  nor a spouse  nor a sexual object ” he said  “Children are children.”  They needed to be protected and provided with health care and education  especially in humanitarian and fragile situations. ROBERTO DE LEÓN HUERTA (Mexico) said it was the right moment to give priority to violence against children in the post-2015 development agenda on the eve of celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention.  Stressing the devastating effects of school bullying on children and adolescents  Mexico strongly believed in the need to combat that form of violence with a multidimensional approach.  Further  he said his delegation was concerned with child labour  which needed to be prevented and eradicated.  Concluding  he said  his country was giving special attention to the protection of children against violence  generating a mechanism to address related issues. MARÍA CLARISA GOLDRICK (Nicaragua) spoke of the restoration of all the rights of children  including free access to education and health.  Other initiatives revolved around the important role played by the family in the well-being of children  as well as on the need for vaccines and comprehensive care during early childhood.  Another way to guarantee the well-being of children  she continued  was to ensure registration at birth  which assured their full rights as citizens. ZAHRAA SALMAN (Iraq) said children made up the majority of the population in many countries  making their protection critical to creating a balanced society.  She then noted the difficulties encountered by her country due to recent terrorist attacks carried out  in terms of kidnapping  displacement and murder.  Children were also exposed  she continued  to illness and malnutrition  worsening the situation.  Progress made by the Government in tackling these issues included a rise in the level of education  the provision of education in national languages  as well as a ban on the recruitment of children to armed groups. MIGUEL CAMILO RUIZ (Colombia) said his country was committed to protecting and promoting the rights of children.  Announcing his Government’s three priorities – peace  equity and education – Colombia was working to improve the lives of children by minimizing the inequity that still affected the country.  For instance  only 46 out of 100 young people had access to higher education.  To be equitable  she continued  the Government had created a programme offering 400 000 university scholarships to the best high school students.  Also  the Government had expanded health programmes  which resulted in the reduction of malnutrition from 16 per cent to 13.2 per cent.  Concluding  he said his country had designed programmes to prevent recruitment of children into armed groups and reintegrate the ones who left back into the society. FIRDOSA IBRAHIM (Ethiopia) said that the promotion and protection of the rights of children had been a priority for her country  where children constituted a large segment of the population.  Significant steps had been taken to ensure compatibility between national laws and relevant international human rights instruments.  Through the implementation of its health policy  Ethiopia had reduced the under-five mortality rate three years ahead of the deadline.  Primary education was free for all citizens  and all children were encouraged to go to school.  Female genital mutilation and early marriage had been banned in the country and their rates of practice had dropped dramatically.  The Government had also criminalized trafficking of children and had made 18 the minimum age of recruitment to the armed forces.  The constitution explicitly forbade acts of violence that affected children and a child-friendly system had been instituted in the judiciary to deal with rights of offenders. TSHAMANO MILUBI (South Africa) said that his country was working hard to ensure that children had access to basic social services  such as education  sanitation and safe drinking water.  South Africa condemned the actions of militias  such as Boko Haram  that were harming the future of the region’s children.  It was vital that the United Nations system collaborated with Member States on specific strategies to combat such militias.  A legal framework was urgently needed  he said  adding that his country was deeply concerned about the plight of children in armed conflict.  There should be no impunity for those who committed such offences.  Turning to his country  he noted that the Government had directed substantial resources to early childhood development and had already achieved the Millennium Development Goals goal of universal primary education. DRAGANA ANĐELIĆ (Bosnia and Herzegovina) said that the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention underscored the importance of public awareness of children’s rights.  Stressing that children were the victims of all forms of violence  especially in conflict zones  she said her Government supported the Children  Not Soldiers campaign  which aimed at ending and preventing the recruitment and use of children by national security forces.  Concluding  she said  Bosnia and Herzegovina was ready to continue to ensure the promotion and protection of the rights of children for the sake of their future. DULCE SÁNCHEZ (Honduras) said that there was a serious humanitarian crisis in her region because of the migration of unaccompanied boys and girls.  Such migration  due to drug trafficking  inequity  social exclusion  domestic abuse or family reunification  exposed children to increased risks and vulnerability to violence.  Therefore  the Government was working to reintegrate child migrants with their families and communities and prevent illegal migration to other countries by creating opportunities.  It was vital to integrate and coordinate efforts between countries of origin  transit and destination.  Therefore  her country was working in partnership with other countries as well as other stakeholders including civil society organizations. CRISTÍAN BARROS MELET (Chile) said that the inter-sectoral social protection system established in 2009 was one of Chile’s major achievements in the protection of children’s rights.  His country was reforming the education system at all levels and had sent to Congress a bill to establish a deputy secretariat for education that would focus on pre-school education.  The Government was also working to mend and adapt existing institutions.  Reducing inequality within countries and between countries was one of the big challenges confronting the international community  he concluded.  KHALIFA ALHARARI (Libya) said his country was committed to applying the highest international standards to ensure the protection of children through regional and international instruments.  Education was a right for all  he said  adding that his Government provided free education to all Libyans.  In addition  Libya supported the Children  Not Soldiers campaign  which was launched in March 2014 by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict and UNICEF.  Concluding  he condemned the crimes practised in Gaza  where Palestinian children were the victims  adding that the international community must shoulder its full responsibility to protect those children from violence.   RANIA TALAL ABDULBAQI (Saudi Arabia) expressed her country’s strong support for all efforts and measures taken by Member States and United Nations’ organizations and bodies working to promote and protect children’s rights.  She said the promotion and protection of the rights of children were obligations derived from the Islamic sharia  which cared about all interests of children without discrimination based on colour  race  sex  sect or religion.  Further  she noted that children were experiencing all forms of violence in conflict zones  such as rape  sexual exploitation  torture  ill-treatment  trafficking  involvement in armed conflicts and drugs crimes.  In that regard  she called upon Member States to cooperate to find swift solutions to promote and protect children’s rights to ensure their access to a better future. DAYANGKU SAIHALINA DAUD (Brunei Darussalam) said her country had met the Millennium Development Goals on the reduction of child mortality  improvement to maternal health and combatting HIV/AIDS  malaria  and other diseases due to the Government’s proactive efforts.  Highlighting the importance of a stable and loving atmosphere for raising children  she said her country had introduced several programmes to strengthen and empower families  such as pre-marital and post-marital courses  financial management  family values  domestic violence  parenting and communication skills.  In recognition of the importance of family  Brunei celebrated a National Family Day on the first Sunday of May every year to enable families to spend more quality time with their children and family members. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-16,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaab4123.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Delegates at the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) today voiced their concerns about the cash flow problems of the Organization’s regular budget and the need for effective management of existing resources as they discussed the world body’s financial situation. Canada’s representative  also speaking on behalf of Australia and New Zealand  said the unpaid assessments for the regular and peacekeeping budgets had increased by 5 per cent over last year.  That left countries contributing troops  police and equipment for the Organization’s peacekeeping activities waiting for reimbursement of their incurred costs.  “Fiscal discipline by the Organization and commitment by all Member States to meet their obligations […] are two sides of one coin ” she said. While pleased with the near completion of the overhaul of the Organization’s world Headquarters  several delegates stressed the importance of settling the funding issues of the Capital Master Plan’s associated costs.  Malaysia’s representative urged Member States to soon make an objective decision to ensure the Plan’s full completion. The representative of Bolivia  speaking for the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  said the Secretariat should closely monitor the regular budget’s cash position  especially regarding the use of the regular budget’s Working Capital Fund and Special Account as a cash bridging mechanism for the Plan for those associated costs.  (The associated costs and secondary data centre expenditures of the Plan total $154.8 million.) She also urged all Member States  especially those with the capacity to settle their arrears  to meet their financial commitments in a timely fashion.  The Group was concerned that the available cash level for the regular budget was already low and would worsen by year’s end. At today’s meeting  Under-Secretary General for Management Yukio Takasu gave a brief update on the Organization’s financial picture after delivering a full set of numbers — on the regular budget  peacekeeping operations  tribunals and the Capital Master Plan — at a Fifth Committee meeting last week.  The regular budget’s cash position had eased with the addition of $86.2 million since 2 October  when the regular budget’s cash position stood at $419 million and disbursements were expected to total $800 million by year end.  This year’s cash squeeze had worsened due to the increased financing needs of the Plan and emergency funding for the United Nations operations to control the Ebola outbreak. “It is very important that concerned Member States made their contributions to pay their outstanding regular budget assessments ” said Mr. Takasu  adding that 31 Member States had now paid their assessments in full for all categories. In other financial business  the Committee also discussed the reports and audited financial statements introduced by Hugh O’Farrell  Chair of the Audit Operations Committee of the Board of Auditors.  Mr. O’Farrell introduced nearly two dozen reports that outlined detailed financial information  for the biennium ended 31 December 2013  for United Nations agencies  programmes and funds  as well as the Secretariat. Pedro Guazo  Director of the Accounts Division of the Office of Programme Planning  Budget and Accounts  introduced the Secretary-General’s report on its implementation of the Board’s recommendations.  Carlos Ruiz Massieu introduced the accompanying report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ). Turning to the Administration of Justice agenda item  Linda Taylor  Executive Director of the Office of the Administration of Justice  introduced the Secretariat report on the issue while Johnston Barkat  Assistant Secretary-General  United Nations Ombudsman  introduced the Secretariat report on the activities of the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services.  Mr. Massieu introduced the ACABQ’s report on the issue. Finally  the Committee turned to the agenda item  Programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015  and heard Ann de la Roche  Officer-in-Charge of the United Nations Office for Partnerships  introduce the Secretary-General’s report on the activities of that office. Also speaking today were representatives of Singapore (on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN))  Senegal  Viet Nam  Japan  China  Cuba  Switzerland (also on behalf of Liechtenstein)  United States  Russian Federation and India  as well as the European Union. The Fifth Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Monday  20 October  to take up action on a draft resolution on programme planning and discuss the pattern of conferences agenda item. Improving Financial Situation of United Nations YUKIO TAKASU  Under-Secretary-General for Management  updated the Committee on the current financial situation of the Organization.  Since the previous 2 October cut-off date for reporting figures  the United Nations had received $86.2 million for the regular budget  including $83.2 million from the United States  $1.7 million from Cuba  and $1 million from Serbia.  For the peacekeeping operations  it had received $332.8 million from 30 Member States  including $121.7 million from the Russian Federation  $117.2 million from China  $38.1 million from the United Arab Emirates  $11.3 million from Norway  $7.7 million from Austria  and $7.4 million from Portugal.  A total of $1.12 million had been received for the International Tribunals  including $1.09 million from the United Arab Emirates. Those payments brought the number of Member States which had paid their assessments in full for all categories to 31  up from 29  he said.  Thirty-five Member States had now paid their assessments in full for peacekeeping operations while 99 Member States had paid all their assessment for the International Tribunals.  He referred to the report of the Secretary-General on improving the financial situation (document A/69/520)  which reviewed the situation as it stood on 2 October and provided an update to his previous report on the subject. As discussed at last week’s Committee meeting  Mr. Takasu said available cash in the regular budget was at a low level and the situation would worsen in the final months of this year.  That cash flow tightening would become more severe with the use of the regular budget’s Working Capital Fund and Special Account for financing the Capital Master Plan associated costs and the funding of the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER).  “It is very important that concerned Member States made their contributions to pay their outstanding regular budget assessments ” he added. DAYANA RIOS (Bolivia)  speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  said the Group was concerned that the available cash level for the regular budget was already low and would worsen by year’s end.  The Group urged all Member States  especially those with the capacity to settle their arrears  to meet their financial commitments in a timely fashion.  In that regard  it strongly rejected all unilateral coercive measures contrary to international law  which sometimes impeded budget payments from members of the Group. Referring to the negative cash situation of the Capital Master Plan  she said Assembly resolution A/68/247 B had authorized the Secretary-General to use the Working Capital Fund and Special Account as a bridging mechanism to address the project’s possible cash flow challenges.  That decision was made on an exceptional basis and the result of the Group’s “immense flexibility”.  The Group would closely follow up on the implementation of the mandate  included in the resolution’s operative paragraph 14  Section VII  which mandated that the bridging mechanism be replenished during the main part of the sixty-ninth session of the Assembly.  Concerning outstanding payments to Member States that provided troops  formed-police units and contingent-owned equipment to peacekeeping operations  the Group recognized the Secretary-General’s efforts to reduce these payments and firmly urged that additional efforts be carried out to ensure Member States were quickly reimbursed in full. KAREN TAN (Singapore)  speaking for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  and associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  said that she was encouraged that the overall financial indicators for 2014 were sound and commended the 29 Member States who had met their financial obligations to the Organization in full.  However  she expressed concern at the significant unpaid assessments remaining  particularly for the regular budget.  She stressed that Member States were bound under the Charter to fulfil their financial obligations  which should be done on time  in full and without conditions.  Failure to do so would compromise the financial standing and effectiveness of the Organization. The United Nations also needed to exercise greater fiscal discipline and use initiatives such as Umoja and the implementation of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) to build a strong  effective and results-oriented Organization  she said.  Furthermore  she encouraged the Secretariat to improve the transparency of its work and to provide clear and timely information to Member States.  As the world’s only multilateral organization with global membership and universal legitimacy  it was best placed to deal with the many challenges Member States collectively faced  but it must have the necessary resources to fulfil its mandates. MARILOU DEBLOIS-LABBÉ (Canada)  speaking also for Australia and New Zealand  expressed concern that only 125 Member States had fully paid their regular budget assessments as of 2 October 2014  compared with 134 at the same time last year.  The total cash currently available was insufficient to cover disbursements through the end of the year.  Unpaid assessments for the regular and peacekeeping budgets had increased by 5 per cent over last year.  That left troop-  police- and equipment-contributing countries waiting for reimbursement of their incurred costs.  She urged all Member States to fulfil their Charter obligations in that regard and urged those eligible to use the mechanism for addressing fiscal arrears by submitting multi-year payment plans. The resources provided by Member States must be managed effectively to ensure that the demands of the full range of global peace  security and development challenges could be met  she continued.  “Fiscal discipline by the Organization and commitment by all Member States to meet their obligations […] are two sides of one coin ” she said.  Working together to ensure that both imperatives were met was essential to the Organization’s ability to function effectively and meet the challenges confronting it now and in the future. FRANCESCO PRESUTTI  a representative of the European Union Delegation  encouraged Member States to pay their assessed contributions in full and as soon as possible  as the level of cash available for the regular budget was currently low and the situation was expected to tighten even further towards the end of the year.  Concrete steps must be taken to spend more wisely  deliver in new ways and ensure the Organization functioned within its agreed budget.  The Union’s members contributed nearly 35 per cent of the United Nations regular budget  exceeding by far their gross national income share  and approximately 37 per cent of the United Nations peacekeeping budgets.  Only a more equitable sharing of financial responsibilities among Member States according to their actual capacity to pay could secure a sustainable financing architecture for the United Nations system. FODE SECK (Senegal)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  recognized the increase in the number of Member States that had paid their assessed contributions in full and expressed Senegal’s own commitment to honour its obligations to the regular budget  the Capital Master Plan  International Tribunals and peacekeeping operations.  It was vital for the Secretariat to seek innovative methods to clearly improve the effectiveness of its activities.  To that end  adequate management standards must be adopted and efforts must continue to reduce operational costs and streamline posts.  He called for the establishment of a separate account for the special political missions  and urged Member States to pay their obligations under the regular and peacekeeping budgets on time and in full because arrears adversely impacted reimbursement to troop-contributing countries  forcing developing countries in particular to spend their own resources to train contingencies and renew equipment. NGUYEN VIET LAM (Viet Nam)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that it was of utmost importance that the financial situation of the Organization remained strong.  It was concerning that many Member States had outstanding payments.  His country was among the 176 States that had paid in full its contributions for the Capital Master Plan as of 2 October. SHIGETOSHI NAGAO (Japan) said that his country  despite having a different budget cycle than the United Nations  had paid in full all its assessments for the Organization’s regular budget  peacekeeping operations  International Tribunals and the Capital Master Plan.  His Government did so despite enormous domestic financial difficulties and recent exchange rate fluctuations.  The Secretariat should closely monitor the cash position of the regular budget  especially in relation to the Capital Master Plan cash-bridging mechanism  and the situation of the Working Capital Fund and Special Account for financing the Plan  while continuing to use the resources contributed by Member States efficiently and effectively. HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia)  aligning himself with the Group of 77 and China  and with ASEAN  expressed concern that unpaid contributions totalled $1.39 billion in April this year.  The $2.6 billion in outstanding contributions to the peacekeeping budget were also of concern; his country would shoulder its responsibility in that regard  signifying its serious commitment to international peace and security.  Pleased to see the completion of the Capital Master Plan  and contributions towards it almost as full as mandated  his Government took note of prevailing financial needs for its completion.  Associated cost issues must be addressed.  Member States must make an objective decision soon to ensure the Plan’s full completion.  Financing the United Nations was the responsibility of its Member States; they must fulfil their obligations in good faith. GUO ZHIQI (China)  endorsing the Group of 77’s statement  said that although the United Nations financial situation remained stable  it had deteriorated compared with the same period last year.  She called on Member States to pay their assessed contributions on time and without conditions.  China’s assessed contributions to the regular and peacekeeping budget had been on a “sharp rise ” and now exceeded $600 million annually.  Yet despite years of rapid growth  the Chinese economy was now in a stage of “structural adjustment”  with strong downward pressure  and a levelling off of Government revenue.  The country had taken measures to control spending and increase resource efficiency  and had already paid in full its 2014 contributions of $134 million and its assessments for the two International Tribunals.  By 13 October  China had paid its peacekeeping operations assessment of $236 million.  He asked the Secretariat to include that information in its updated report. Mr. SANCHEZ AZCUY (CUBA)  associating with the Group of 77 and China  expressed concern with the United Nations financial situation.  As the world’s most universal intergovernmental organization  the United Nations needed a stable financial situation to carry out its mandates and Member States must make their payments on time.  It was significant that one Member State accounted for most of the unpaid money and also benefited from the distorted methodology used to assess Member State payments.  The accumulation of late payments had a negative effect on the Organization’s ability to carry out its mandates.  The financial crisis of recent years had made it difficult for many developing countries to make their payments.  Coercive  unilateral measures in place violated international law and impacted some countries’ ability to maintain their payments.  Despite that  Cuba maintained its commitment to multilateralism.  The United States economic and financial embargo had made it more difficult for Cuba to make its payments to the United Nations and made it impossible for Cuba to use United States dollars for its international financial transactions.  Cuba’s transactions were subjected to exchange rate fluctuations.  In addition  transfers to international organizations had been frozen.  He called for an end to the embargo. Board of Auditors’ Reports and Audited Financial Statements HUGH O’FARRELL  Chair  Audit Operations Committee  Board of Auditors  introduced the main findings of the Board of Auditor’s Concise Summary and the reports of the audits carried out on financial statements for the period ending 31 December 2013 of various United Nations system bodies. These financial reports and audited financial statements included:  the United Nations (document A/69/5(Vol.I))  International Trade Centre (document A/69/5(Vol.III))  United Nations University (document A/69/5 (Vol.IV))  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) (documents A/69/5/Add.1 & Corr.1)  United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF)(document A/69/5/Add.2)  United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) (document A/69/5/Add.3)  United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) (document A/69/5/Add.4)  United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR)(document A/69/5/Add.5)  Voluntary funds administered by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) (document A/69/5/Add.6)  Fund of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (document A/69/5/Add.7)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) (document A/69/5/Add.8)  United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat)(document A/69/5/Add.9)  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) (document A/69/5/Add.10)  United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS)(documents A/69/5/Add.11 & Corr.1)  United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) (document A/69/5/Add.12)  International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (document A/69/5/Add.13)  International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (document A/69/5/Add.14) and International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (document A/69/5/Add.15). Mr. O’Farrell said there were no qualified opinions for the 19 entities  plus the United Nations peacekeeping operations  that were audited in the period.  All nine entities that had implemented IPSAS in 2012 again received unqualified audit opinions for the financial year that ended 31 December.  All 10 entities reporting biennially under the United Nations System Accounting Standards (UNSAS) received unqualified audit opinions. He said the use of IPSAS had improved financial management processes  reporting and skills  capacity and staff financial literacy across all entities.  There was varied progress in carrying out robust enterprise risk management approaches among the United Nations entities.  There had been positive progress at the United Nations as the Management Committee had identified six top strategic risks facing the Organization.  The Board was increasingly reporting on weaknesses in budget formulation  execution and reporting by the entities.  For example  that was a recurring theme in the Board’s annual reports on peacekeeping operations.  The Board also reported on a range of issues related to implementing partners. The Board had undertaken work on fraud awareness in four entities during the 2012-2013 biennium:  UNOPS  UNHCR  UNRWA and the United Nations  he said.  It had highlighted concerns about the likely underreporting of fraud and the need of integrated strategic fraud strategies and more robust assessments of fraud risks  particularly external fraud risks.  In the United Nations particularly  the Board highlighted the need to address the current fragmentation of existing policies  procedures and guidance in relation to fraud.  That also was a concern of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS).  The Board was concerned that the United Nations did not have a well-developed protocol or framework for staff to follow when a serious external fraud occurred  despite the assurance provided in the Secretary-General’s report on the implementation of the Board’s recommendations (document A/69/353).  The Board encouraged the consideration of a system-wide counter-fraud unit to tackle fraud risks  especially risks that straddled organization boundaries  on behalf of the system as a whole. He noted that the Organization was in the midst of several major business transformation activities.  Umoja  the new enterprise resource planning system  particularly was at a critical juncture as management faced issues stemming from Umoja’s roll-out in peacekeeping and special political missions.  Additionally  the remaining roll-out of the system had to be more realistically planned. PEDRO GUAZO  Director  Accounts Division  Office of Programme Planning  Budget and Accounts  Department of Management  introduced the Secretary-General’s report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors contained in its reports on the United Nations for the biennium ended 31 December 2013 and on the Capital Master Plan for the year ended 31 December 2013 (document A/69/353)  as well as his report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors contained in its reports on the United Nations funds and programmes for the biennium ended 31 December 2013 (document A/69/353/Add.1). The Executive Heads had concurred with most of the Board’s recommendations and had made every effort to ensure compliance with the General Assembly’s request to implement the Board’s recommendations  he said.  Of the 40 recommendations to the United Nations for the biennium 2010-2011  eight were closed by the Board.  Of the remaining 32  a total of 20  or 63 per cent  were fully implemented  up from the previous biennium’s 60 per cent rate; 11  or 34 per cent  were being implemented and one had been overtaken by events.  As for recommendations to the 19 entities the Board audited for the biennium 2012-2013  it considered the full implementation rate of 56 per cent as evidence of strong management commitment. CARLOS RUIZ MASSIEU  Chair of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ)  introduced that body’s report on financial reports and audited financial statements and reports of the Board of Auditors for the period ended 31 December 2013 (document A/69/386). He said that the Advisory Committee concurred with the Board’s view on the need to develop mechanisms to share vital information concerning implementing partners.  It considered that the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) might be a suitable forum for discussing a possible system-wide mechanism in that regard.  ACABQ also stressed the importance of heads of entities dedicating adequate attention to address deficiencies in staff skills in such areas as human resource management  asset management and procurement.  The Board should provide a deeper analysis on the anti-fraud approaches of UNHCR  UNOPS and the United Nations Secretariat in future audit reports that would also include the anti-fraud controls undertaken by other United Nations entities. Noting that the Board continued to provide updates on the need to put adequate internal oversight arrangements in place at UNHCR and UNITAR  he said that ACABQ recommended that this matter be concluded urgently.  Regarding the retention rates and reserve levels at UNICEF and the requirement for a formal cooperation agreement with the Japan Foundation at United Nations University (UNU)  the Advisory Committee concurred with the Board’s recommendations.  As for the Secretariat  the Board had been emphasizing the need for more clarity on the “target operating model” for the transformation projects  or the “service delivery model”.  The General Assembly should ask the Secretary-General to submit a report containing his proposals on that matter as soon as possible. Ms. RIOS (Bolivia)  speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China  noted that 9 of the 19 entities were reporting on an annual basis upon their completing the full implementation of IPSAS in 2012  and 10 on a biennial basis still reporting under UNSAS.  The Group concurred with the Board on the need for enhanced oversight  accountability and governance for globally dispersed operations.  It concurred with ACABQ on the need for more comprehensive disclosure of specific issues examined and that the Board of Auditors should enumerate the entities considered  identify a standard set of parameters applied  and where common themes were present  provide further analysis in its concise summary report to facilitate cross-entity comparisons.  It supported development of appropriate guidance on the level of reserves across the various United Nations entities.  The Group supported the development of mechanisms to share information on implementing partners. The Group was deeply concerned  she said  with comments and recommendations made by the Board on the budget process in document A/68/5 (VOL.1)  and concurred with the Advisory Committee in its observation that the Board made recommendations without distinction of actions that were within the scope of the Secretariat and those that required intergovernmental decisions.  The Group did not support any of the recommendations that would imply changes to the current budget procedures  processes  rules and format.  Any budget changes must be reviewed and approved by the Fifth Committee and the Committee for Programme and Coordination.  The Group urged the Board to direct all future recommendations solely to the Administration and to focus them exclusively in areas within the Secretariat’s purview. Ms. SCHWEIZER (Switzerland)  also speaking on behalf of Liechtenstein  welcomed the Secretary-General’s progress in enterprise risk-management  and called upon the United Nations administration to “mainstream” this approach.  He supported the Board’s recommendation for clearly defined modalities and implementation time frames for results-based management whose implementation had been stalled for years.  He agreed with the Board’s recommendations for revising the Secretariat’s budget preparation process  encouraged the Secretary-General to implement those recommendations  and said that management processes must undergo changes to take full advantage of the possibilities offered by Umoja.  Without a proactive approach by the Secretariat  there was a risk that Umoja’s implementation could serve to consolidate the inefficiencies of the United Nations current management system.  She underscored the Board’s recommendation that a more coordinated approach be adopted to combat fraud across the United Nations system.  Finally  she pointed out that the United Nations workforce management had been driven by immediate needs to fill vacancies rather than strategic medium- and long-term needs assessments. CHERITH NORMAN CHALET (United States) said expert oversight of the United Nations’ operations and finances was crucial to ensuring that the Organization met Member States’ expectations.  The steps taken by Member States and the Secretariat to address the findings and recommendations by the Board were even more important.  The findings related to fraud by implementing partners was concerning.  Member States’ financial constraints and increasing demands for the United Nations services had created a situation in which “becoming more efficient and cost-effective is no longer optional”.  There was a need for a specific plan to address fraud by those partners.  The report also noted that the regular budget process was time-consuming and costly.  It produced large volumes of information  much of which was very useful.  But very few had time to fully read and absorb the information in time to make informed decisions.  A key observation by the Board suggested that results were not fully considered when allocating resources through adoption of the budget.  The budget process should be re-examined. SERGEY KHALIZOV (Russian Federation) said his delegation had studied the recommendations of the Board and recognized its work in many areas  including providing greater transparency and compliance with procedures.  He noted that the Board had made unmodified opinions for all of the entities.  But with the implementation of IPSAS  the volume of the Board’s work would have to grow.  He hoped the audits would continue to be of top quality.  Regarding the United Nations financial statements  he urged attention to the budgeting of the Organization.  The Assembly’s leadership role in defining the resources of the Organization should remain in its exclusive purview. MANJUNATH DENKANIKOTTA CHENNEERAPPA (India)  aligning with the Group of 77 and China  commended the Board for its observations and its very important role in the Organization’s management.  He commended the Board’s work and appreciated the report of the Advisory Committee.  India said it was positive that the Board had not identified any major failures in control.  But India was concerned with the trend of the growth in voluntary funding.  That trend  along with fiscal pressures faced by countries  showed the need for the strong management of existing resources.  It was futile to artificially freeze the budget.  Surprisingly  many important activities in peacekeeping operations were funded voluntary.  The Organization’s core mandates should be funded by the regular budget.  In addition  it was necessary that the Board’s recommendations be carried out quickly. LINDA TAYLOR  Executive Director  Office of the Administration of Justice  introducing the Secretary-General’s report on Administration of justice at the United Nations (document A/69/227)  said that the report  divided into six sections  contained statistics and information on the functioning of the formal system of administering justice in 2013  as well as observations on the operation of that system  drawn from those statistics and the experience of the Office of Administration of Justice and other relevant stakeholders  and also provided a consolidated response to the Assembly’s requests in resolution 68/254. In addition to observations on the formal system’s operation since its inception and in 2013  findings from Section II also indicated  among other things  that the number of cases coming into the formal system seemed to be stabilizing  with the majority continuing to relate to appointment-related decisions  she said.  Noting the continued rise in the number of self-represented staff members  it was recommended that that systemic issue be examined as part of the interim independent assessment.  Section II also provided statistics and information on the activities of various entities involved in the formal system and identified  in that context  the need to extend positions of three ad litem judges for the United Nations Dispute Tribunal (UNDT)  if it were to continue to manage its caseload. Section III laid out detailed responses to specific requests by the General Assembly  she continued  among them a revised proposal on an interim independent assessment of the system of administration; efforts to institutionalize good management practices; the status of revised terms of reference for the Office of the Ombudsman and Mediation Services; and monthly opt-out rates and staff contributions under the voluntary supplemental funding mechanism for the Office of Staff Legal Assistance (OSLA).  The Secretary-General set out his conclusions and recommendations for action in the final section.  In closing  she drew attention to the report of the Internal Justice Council (document A/69/205)  which included that body’s views on the implementation and functioning of the system of administration of justice as well as the views of the judges of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal (UNAT) and UNDT. JOHNSTON BARKAT  United Nations Ombudsman  introduced the Secretary-General’s report on Activities of the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services (document A/69/126).  According to the report  the ombudsmen and mediators were able to provide assistance in more than 2 000 cases in 2013  with over 1 600 coming from Secretariat staff.  While the total number had remained fairly flat over the past few years  the number of mediation cases increased from 36 in 2012 to 73 in 2013.  The focus was not on who was right or who was wrong  but on how individuals and teams could find respectful and mutually satisfactory resolutions.  About 80 per cent of the cases emanated from outside New York.  The most prominent types of concerns were job and career issues (28 per cent) and evaluative relationships (23 per cent).  The Office had increased its emphasis on building “conflict competence” in the Organization — skills to better manage conflict. The report also provided an update on some cross-cutting and systemic issues  such as the relationship between locally recruited and international staff in peacekeeping missions and issues relating to performance management and the conduct of investigations  he said.  The Office continued to look for ways to better serve staff in field operations where its capacity was limited.  About 70 per cent of staff in peacekeeping operations was based in Africa and other critical staff worked in the special political missions in the Middle East.  The Office was planning two on-site visits to support staff in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA). Mr. MASSIEU introduced ACABQ’s related report (A/69/519).  While reiterating its previous recommendations on the interim independent assessment of the administration of justice  the Advisory Committee reiterated its previous recommendations and also asked for an exam of the structure and funding mechanisms of other international  national and regional systems.  It also recommended that the panel of experts consult with Member States and external entities such as other international and regional organizations on national labour dispute mechanisms.  He recommended the panel hire a Secretary at the P-5 level  not D-1 as proposed by the Secretary-General. Regarding the voluntary supplemental funding mechanism for the Office of Staff Legal Assistance  the Advisory Committee recommended that the Secretary-General continue to track staff contribution data  including on staff opting out of the mechanism  he said.  Other recommendations touched on informal dispute resolution improvements  the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services  and how to render accountable for financial losses in cases where individuals violated the Organization’s rules and procedures.  He voiced no objection to the proposed extension of three ad litem judges for the Dispute Tribunal  and recommended against the requested P-3 Legal Officer post for the Registry of the United Nationals Appeal Tribunal  which combined with the other recommendations would result in a reduction of $167 100 under section 1 and $57 600 under section 29D of the 2014-2015 programme budget. Ms. RIOS (Bolivia)  speaking again for the Group of 77 and China  said the reform approved by General Assembly resolutions 61/261  62/228  63/253 and 65/251 had established a system for administering justice that was independent  transparent  professional  adequately resourced and decentralized  and was consistent with international law and the principles of the rule of law and due process.  It ensured respect for the rights and obligations of staff members and the accountability of managers and staff members alike. Noting achievements in disposing of the backlog and addressing new cases  she said that any reduction in the International Tribunals’ judicial capacity would significantly increase the time required to adjudicate cases.  Noting further that informal dispute resolutions were essential to the system  she expressed regret that the Office of the Ombudsman and mediation services had yet to respond to the Assembly’s requests regarding promulgation of their revised terms of references.  She also voiced concerns that the increase of applications in the system was an indicator of bad management and poor staff-management relations.  In that context  lessons learned for managers should produce concrete results. Mr. PRESUTTI  a representative for the European Union Delegation  commended progress made since 2009 towards full implementation of the new system of administration of justice at the United Nations.  Five years in  a decision should be made on a proposal from the Secretary-General for conducting an interim independent assessment of the system  which was an opportunity to analyse whether the objectives set by the Assembly were being achieved in an efficient  cost-effective manner  and how the system might be further improved.  He welcomed the Secretary-General’s revised proposal and expressed support for the Advisory Committee’s observations and recommendations in that regard.  He also stressed the importance of thoroughly analysing the working methods of the International Tribunals under the statutes and rules of procedure  taking into account all relevant Assembly resolutions.  Pointing out that there was a direct correlation between poor or ineffective performance management and the high caseload the system was handling  he said that improving performance management must be a major focus for the Secretary-General. Ms. SCHWEIZER (Switzerland)  also speaking on behalf of Liechtenstein  noted that because most cases heard at the International Tribunals related to appointments and separation of service  improvements to the administration of justice should go hand in hand with improvements in human resource management and the performance management system.  She commended the Office of the Ombudsman and Mediations Services for their efforts to encourage amicable resolutions.  She supported the extension of three ad litem judges to reduce the high caseload  and looked forward to the Internal Justice Council’s proposals to reduce delays in the disposal of cases. Though the implementation of the staff-funded mechanism to supplement the Office of Staff Legal Assistance was a major achievement  she regretted that a significant per cent of United Nations staff had opted out of the fund  even though salary deductions would be no more than 0.05 per cent.  She welcomed the revised proposal by the Secretary-General which should result in concrete recommendations for correcting identified flaws in the new administration of justice system.  Given the Committee’s “staggering workload”  and because the administration of justice system did not require the same attention as when it was set up five years ago  she suggested reducing the submission of reports on the administration of justice and the related Committee resolution to once every two years. ERIKO YAJIMA (Japan) reiterated her country’s support for the use of informal conflict resolution  and the effectiveness of the Management Evaluation Unit for resolving cases before they proceeded to the tribunals.  Her country looked forward to details on the progress of the voluntary supplemental funding mechanism for the Office of Staff Legal Assistance.  It was important to understand the trends of a new mechanism during the experimental period in order to seek out better methods for improving the system.  She backed ACABQ’s view that an interim assessment of the administration of justice system was needed in order to evaluate the functioning of the system to date and to ensure it met its objectives as a mechanism to effectively resolve labour disputes.  Japan was willing to further engage in discussions on how to implement such an assessment. Ms. CHALET (United States) expressing approval of the Management Evaluation Unit that had contributed to the early resolution of disputes  said challenges nevertheless remained.  Since many harassment and discrimination complaints arose out of performance management issues  reform of the justice system would be most successful if undertaken concurrent with strengthening the United Nations performance management processes. She questioned how ongoing feedback to staff would be effectuated since midpoint reviews were not being fully implemented.  Though supporting the Secretary-General’s proposal for interim independent assessment of the Administration of Justice  to guard against judicial overreach he expected the analysis to include the Tribunals’ interpretation of their authorities.  Moral damages and stays pending appeal in excess of jurisdiction should be considered in that assessment or sooner.  Including in the context of administration of justice  the United States wanted to insure that whistle-blowers who had been the subject of retaliations would have adequate avenues to seek protection and remedies  and that retaliators would be held accountable for their actions. Mr. KHALIZOV (Russian Federation) said that ACABQ’s report had been made available only a few hours before the start of today’s session.  His delegation did not have enough time to consult with its capital on the matter.  The practice of delayed issuances of reports was inadmissible.  Decisive measures were needed to remedy the situation and for the timely delivery of documents in all official languages. United Nations Office for Partnerships ANN DE LA ROCHE  Officer in Charge  United Nations Office for Partnerships (UNOP)  introduced the Secretary-General’s report on that Office (document A/69/218).  She said that UNOP was created in 2006 to strengthen system-wide coherence in the establishment of operational relationships with global partners of the United Nations  and to oversee the United Nations Fund for International Partnerships (UNFIP).  UNFIP was established in 1998 as the interface for the partnership between the United Nations system and the United Nations Foundation — the public charity responsible for administering Ted Turner’s $1 billion contribution; the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF)  established in 2005  which supported democratization throughout the world focusing on democratic institutions  promoting human rights  and ensuring the participation of all groups in democratic processes; and Partnership Advisory and Outreach Services  which provided assistance to a variety of entities  including academic institutions  companies  foundations  Government agencies and civil society organizations. At the end of 2013  the cumulative allocations provided by the United Nations Foundation through UNFIP to United Nations projects reached $1.3 billion  she said.  Of this amount  $0.45 billion represented core Turner funds and $0.85 billion was generated from co-financing partners.  A total of 544 United Nations projects and programmes were supported as of the end of 2013 and had been implemented by 43 United Nations entities in 124 countries.  In the new round of UNDEF funding in 2013  the Office supported 46 projects from among more than 2 000 proposals.  Its outreach activities included providing support to the Permanent Memorial project and African First Ladies Health Summit. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-16,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gadis3504.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The first place to look to understand insufficient progress in disarmament was at the lack of harmony between domestic policies and international responsibilities  the High Representative for Disarmament Affairs told the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) today as it concluded its general debate and began its thematic discussion on disarmament machinery. Recalling the words of former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld in 1961  High Representative Angela Kane said the United Nations faced two alternative futures:  It could either limit its role to serve as “static conference machinery”  or it could become a “dynamic instrument” in the service of global interest. “He left little doubt which future he preferred ” she said  adding that the same choice was now before the disarmament community.  “Let us choose wisely ” she said. During two panel discussions  high-ranking representatives discussed the roles and progress of their various organizations.  The representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said verification challenges were becoming more complex as the global nuclear landscape continued to change.  While more nuclear facilities were being placed under safeguards  new ones were becoming ever more sophisticated  which made implementation of safeguards more challenging. The Deputy-Director General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said that her organization had embarked on a historic mission to eliminate Syrian chemical weapons.  A total of 98 per cent of Syria’s declared chemical stocks had so far been destroyed  proving the resilience of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  Still  more work was needed to ensure that mechanisms were in place to prevent the re-emergence of weapons of that kind. Speaking of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO)  the Director of that organization’s International Data Centre said the Treaty body had succeeded in keeping the world nuclear-weapon free for years.  With the support of Member States  the international monitoring system was 90 per cent complete  which represented an unparalleled “return on investment.”  But the longer it took for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) to enter into force  there was a growing risk of “treaty fatigue”. The President of the Conference on Disarmament said that although that body had been unable to adopt a programme of work  the 2014 session was still filled with activities.  Nevertheless  the fact remained that the Conference was still unable to commence substantive work  as had been the case for 18 years. The Disarmament Commission operated in a sensitive field and required pragmatism on all sides  that body’s Chair said.  Despite significant efforts  the 2014 session had produced no substantive results due to the deadlock concerning the linkages between nuclear issues and conventional weapons items.  No decision or proposal had been possible in one field without having a decision in another.    The Chair of the Secretary-General’s Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters said the Board looked forward to next year’s discussions on the use of arms control to manage conflict  the humanitarian consequences of nuclear use  and  among others  non-State actors.  The Board hoped the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) would become a self-sustaining member of the United Nations family. The Director of UNIDIR said that while the global security situation had been under near-constant stress  UNIDIR had continue to play a key role in providing valuable data and analysis to member States.  “If UNIDIR didn’t exist  the United Nations General Assembly would have to invent it all over again ” she said. During the conclusion of the general debate  the representatives of Egypt and Bolivia delivered statements.  The representative of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (OPANAL) also spoke during the general debate. The representatives of Angola and Pakistan spoke on the disarmament machinery cluster  as did the representative of the European Union delegation. The Committee will meet again at 3 p.m. tomorrow  17 October  to continue its thematic debate on the disarmament machinery. Background The First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) met this afternoon to conclude its general debate and begin its series of thematic discussions.  For background  see Press Release GA/DIS/3497. Debate Statements AMR ABDELLATIF ABOULATTA (Egypt)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Arab and African Groups  called for the “speedy establishment” of nuclear-weapon-free zones  including in the Middle East.  Despite repeated calls  there was a lack of progress in implementation.  Egypt  along with members of the League of Arab States  had spared no effort in contributing its part to providing the necessary support for furthering the process  as demonstrated by the letters compiled in the Note by the Secretary-General (document A/68/781). On the advancement of conventional weapons  he reiterated that “technology should not overtake humanity”.  The potential or actual development of lethal autonomous weapons raised questions about compliance of their use with international humanitarian law  as well as issues of warfare ethics.  Regulations should be put in place before such systems were developed or deployed  he noted. LUIZ FILIPE DE MACEDO SOARES  Secretary General of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (OPANAL)  said his region had an innovative contribution to make towards disarmament  as that densely populated part of the world was kept free of nuclear weapons.  The region might not be “a Shangri-La” but it was important to note that there had been no significant crisis affecting international peace and security that had emerged from the region in many years.  Not a single country in the region was party to any military alliance based on nuclear weapons.  The Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean wished to join with other nuclear-weapon-free zones in a major movement to break the long stalemate in nuclear disarmament negotiations  to get past the so-called “priorities” of the nuclear-weapon States.  Because those States were modernizing their weapons  it was a kind of arms race — a page out of cold war history that should have been turned. JUAN MARCELO ZAMBRANA TORRELIO (Bolivia)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  said that global disarmament standards were crucial to ensure the survival of Mother Earth.  Weapons of mass destruction only endangered peace  international security  and the entire planet.  Nuclear-weapon stockpiles had the capacity to destroy the Earth several times over.  Forty years after the entry into force of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  there was still a handful of privileged States who maintained weapons  including permanent members of the Security Council.  Small nuclear-weapon States must also cease such activities and move beyond the attainment of nuclear weapons.  The international community must reaffirm the primary objective of a world free of nuclear weapons.  It was unacceptable  he said  that some States held nuclear weapons to protect their security interests while others did not have the right to guarantee their respective security.  It was inconceivable to think that weapons could not potentially be used some day  be it deliberate or by accident  he warned. Panel on Disarmament Machinery ANGELA KANE  High Representative for Disarmament Affairs  said that the work  capacities and political will of Member States determined what was possible in disarmament.  The first place to look to understand the lack of progress in disarmament was in the lack of harmony between domestic policies and international responsibilities.  The United Nations had not reacted passively to external events.  For example  in 2006  the General Assembly had recommended that the Secretary-General update the roster of experts and laboratories to investigate the alleged use of chemical weapons.  That and other actions affected the investigation of chemical weapons in Syria. While the United Nations and international organizations had increasing capacities to deal with weapons of mass destruction  she said  it was unlikely that any State or international body could adequately address the immediate or long-term humanitarian consequences of any nuclear weapons use.  In his last annual report  in 1961  former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld said that the United Nations faced two alternative futures:  it could either limit its role to serve as “static conference machinery”  or it could become a “dynamic instrument” in the service of global interest.  He left little doubt which future he preferred  she said  adding that the same choice was now before the disarmament community.  “Let us choose wisely ” she added. GRACE ASIRWATHAM  Deputy-Director General  Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)  said that since the last briefing to the Committee  the OPCW had embarked on a historic mission to eliminate Syrian chemical weapons.  She pointed to significant accomplishments by that mission  remarking that a total of 98 per cent of Syria’s declared chemical stocks had so far been destroyed.  It was vital to draw lessons from that remarkable achievement  in order to respond to future opportunities in the right way  with the right resources.  Above all  the Syria mission had proven the resilience of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  That endeavour also was underpinned by an extraordinary collective international effort and had jointly overcome obstacles by coming up with novel technical solutions. More broadly  she said  the OPCW continued to make good progress.  She noted that  to date  85 per cent of declared chemical weapons had been verified as destroyed and industry inspections had continued apace at 241 per year.  Still  more work was needed to ensure that mechanisms were in place to prevent the re-emergence of those weapons.  To that end  the OPCW had worked with States parties to improve the national implementation of their Convention obligations.  It was also looking to expand cooperation with other international organizations  such as the International Atomic Energy Agency  to develop new synergies. GEOFFREY SHAW  Representative of the Director General of the IAEA  said the Agency had worked hard since 1957 to bring the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology to Member States.  That had included providing access to electricity and improving nutrition.  Recently  the Agency helped support efforts to combat the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone by providing specialized diagnostic equipment. By implementing safeguards  the IAEA independently verified the correctness and completeness of the declarations made by States about their nuclear programmes  he said.  Safeguards provided credible assurances that States were fulfilling their international obligations and served to detect any misuse of nuclear material or technology.  Safeguard agreements were currently in force with 181 States  of which 173 were non-nuclear-weapon States.  The number of States with additional protocols in force continued to rise and now stood at 124. At the same time  he said  the global nuclear landscape continued to change.  Verification challenges were growing and becoming more complex.  While more nuclear facilities were being placed under safeguards  new nuclear facilities were becoming ever more sophisticated  which made implementation of safeguards more challenging.  That global trend was only expected to continue.  Although the responsibility for ensuring nuclear security lay with national Governments  the Agency played a central role in strengthening the global nuclear security framework. RANDY BELL  Director  International Data Centre  Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization  said the Treaty body had succeeded in keeping the world nuclear-weapon free for years  as the non-testing norm provided a deterrent for nuclear-armed States.  However  there was a need for credible assurances of Treaty compliance by all States.  That was the essence of cooperative security in international relations. He went on to report that with the support of Member States  the international monitoring system was 90 per cent complete  which represented an unparalleled “return on investment” for Member States.  Technical capacity-building was essential for developing States  and building a knowledge base in the technical aspects of the Treaty would strengthen its enforcement.  Nevertheless  the longer it took for it to enter into force  he warned  the risk of “treaty fatigue” would grow  which could diminish the likelihood that States would honour their commitments.  There were eight States remaining for the Treaty to enter into force  he said  noting that the CTBTO was encouraged by the expressed intention of the United States to promote ratification.  Likewise  the CTBTO recent engagement with China and Israel had given rise for cautious optimism. Panel Discussion DATO MAZLAN MUHAMMAD  President of the Conference on Disarmament  said that despite initial differences on a variety of issues  he was hopeful that a constructive spirit would continue to prevail in next year’s Conference session.  Although the Conference had been unable to adopt a programme of work  the 2014 session was still filled with activities.  Many delegations were looking forward to engaging with colleagues from civil society  which could perhaps lead to further progress.  Nevertheless  the fact remained that the Conference was still unable to commence substantive work  as had been the case for 18 years.  The Secretary-General had called on the Conference to live up to the international community’s expectations.  He was confident that the incoming president would explore new ideas for that purpose. VLADIMIR DROBNJAK  Chair of the United Nations Disarmament Commission  believed strongly that consensus-building decision-making should remain part of the Commission.  However  operating that way in such a sensitive field required pragmatism on all sides.  He acknowledged that Member States were concerned about the decreasing relevance of the Commission as  despite significant efforts  the 2014 session had produced no substantive results.  The problem was the deadlock concerning the linkages between nuclear issues and conventional weapons items.  No decision or proposal had been possible in one field without having a decision in another.  Thus  the Commission was not able to fulfil its role.  The goal of a new resolution in the Committee was to pave the way for more results-oriented work in the Commission’s 2015 session.  The resolution was more action oriented and would prepare for gradual change.  The Disarmament Commission proposed more general language for fine-tuning the agenda for the 2015 session.  He acknowledged that enthusiasm for the Commission was not at the highest level  and noted that the current Chair would end his mandate this year.  While the Commission had not achieved its goals  it had made “a small step forward”  he said. ISTVÁN GYARMATI  the Chair of the Secretary-General’s Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters  said the Board looked forward to next year’s discussions on the use of arms control to manage conflict  the humanitarian consequences of nuclear use  and  among others  non-State actors.  The Board would come up with recommendations for the Secretary-General after its second meeting in July.  It had been occupied with the situation of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR)  which was a “very strange” member of the United Nations family in that it was not financed from the regular budget and was a research institute  which made its situation “pretty interesting”.  A search for a new director was under way.  It was the Board’s firm desire to go address all open issues and offer solutions  and it hoped to make the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research a self-sustaining member of the United Nations family. THERESA HITCHENS  Director  UNIDIR  said that while the global security situation had been under near-constant stress  UNIDIR had continued to play a key role in providing valuable data and analysis to Member States.  One of the Institute’s unique advantages was its ability to work independently outside the political pressure of the system  she said.  It tried to “move knowledge to action” by building capacity.  It also added value by looking ahead at emerging threats before crises erupted in areas such as cybersecurity.  The Institute  she said  provided Member States with the foundational understanding to make effective decisions that balanced benefits with societal risk  in order to create knowledge-based responses to security challenges.  “If UNIDIR didn’t exist  the United Nations General Assembly would have to invent it all over again.”  As the Institute was funded by voluntary contributions  she thanked Member States that had funded its operations  particularly given financial constraints.  Despite that  longer term solutions were required to address the gap in funding as UNIDIR was being called on to do more. IOANNIS VRAILAS  representative of the European Union delegation  said that the United Nations disarmament machinery was “crucial and irreplaceable”.  Recent positive developments in disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control showed that negotiations in those fields could produce results.  Rather than maintaining the practice of proceeding in a formalistic manner  the First Committee should concentrate its efforts on the most pertinent and topical issues  he noted.  In order to become more relevant  the possibility of “bi- or tri-ennialising” more resolutions  in a balanced manner  should be contemplated.  He expressed disappointment that the Conference on Disarmament had not succeeded in commencing its substantive work.  Nevertheless  there had been some encouraging developments  including the re-establishment of the Informal Working Group to assist in developing a Work Programme.  He reiterated the European Union’s commitment to expanding its membership  underling the importance of continued consultations on the matter and the appointment of a special coordinator for that purpose. MARIA DE JESUS FERREIRA (Angola) confirmed that her country was in the process of ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Chemical Weapons Convention.  In the face of the nuclear weapon threat  the world’s current disarmament situation required harmonized coordination among Member States.  Only when each State gave its best at the national and international levels would it be possible to harmonize the implementation of comprehensive nuclear disarmament programmes  with a view of guaranteeing peace and international security.  Angola did not possess any nuclear installations in its territory  and did not have any national plans to possess them.  Instead  it foresaw projects related to the use of radioisotopes  linear particle accelerators  and a variety of x-ray devices in different activities  particularly in the field of medicine and animal health. ZAMIR AKRAM (Pakistan) said that despite claims of supporting the aim of nuclear disarmament  some of the major nuclear-weapon States had only paid “lip service” to that goal.  In the context of the Conference of Disarmament  they had consistently opposed the start of any negotiations  arguing that the objective could only be achieved through a step by step approach.  That did not contribute to nuclear disarmament as they only envisaged agreements related to non-proliferation measures.  On the CTBT  he said that major nuclear-weapon States had only been ready to negotiate and conclude the Treaty after having conducted more than a thousand nuclear tests  when they no longer required any further testing.  Thus  they had made a “virtue out of necessity”.  Similarly  some major nuclear- weapon States and their allies were promoting negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty  arguing that that was the only “ripe issue” on the Conference on Disarmament’s agenda.  Since they already possessed huge stockpiles of fissile material  those major Powers were ready to make that “sacrifice”.  A meaningful measure relating to fissile material should not only ban future production  but also reduce  or at least put under international safeguards  existing stockpiles. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-16,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaef3401.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Ending poverty was not just about boosting incomes but about efforts “to empower and enable the human spirit to reach its highest destiny”  Indonesia’s representative told the Second Committee (Economic and Financial) today as it continued its discussion of sustainable development. To achieve the eradication of poverty  there must be a stronger global alliance  stressed Nicaragua’s representative  urging States to redouble their efforts to facilitate means of implementation and adequate financing for developing countries. Several delegates spoke about climate change and associated disaster risks.  Samoa’s representative said that “as an existential issue to SIDS [small island developing States] low lying islands  sympathy and pity will not provide solace nor halt the devastating impacts of climate change”.  Since 1990  her country had experienced more frequent and severe weather events costing millions of dollars and forcing relocation of communities. “In just a few hours  a disaster can wipe out years of development ” stated the representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  According to the representative of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)  in 2013  disasters affected more than 96 million people  causing $192 billion in global economic losses.  He stressed that the post-2015 framework for disaster risk reduction must prioritize building the resilience of poor and marginalized groups  and be backed by adequate  targeted and long-term funding. Energy-related issues were discussed by several delegates.  Tajikistan’s representative said that it would be impossible to achieve development goals without ensuring reliable and universal access to energy.  An integrated development of hydro-energy  coupled with the use of other types of renewable energy  ensured sustainability  enhanced efficiency  and reduced emissions. The representative of the United Arab Emirates pointed out that his country had the largest solar energy plant in the world  and it produced clean energy while contributing to emission reductions of around 20 per cent.  Georgia’s representative stated that more than 80 per cent of her country’s electricity was provided by renewable sources.  On the other hand  Jamaica’s representative said that while his country had made some advances in renewable energy  for success in the long run  a better international framework was needed  including reliable transit of energy. Protection of biodiversity was highlighted as an important issue for the post-2015 development agenda by the representative of Brunei Darussalam.  With 75 per cent of its land area covered by tropical rainforests  her country had been actively involved in forest conservation.  Pointing to an irreversible degradation of forest ecosystems and biodiversity loss  Senegal’s representative said the illicit trade in timber worsened that situation  and called for an International Fund for Forests and a legally binding agreement to help with protection. Several delegates talked about the problem of desertification  highlighted by Namibia’s representative as a major concern for his country.  He emphasized the need for land-based approaches to adaptation to build climate shock resilience.  Similarly  Botswana’s representative noted that the severe threats of climate change  desertification  land degradation and drought not only reversed the economic and social gains his country had made  but debilitated its efforts to address the needs of its population. Many countries now recognized the need for sustainable land management  said Iceland’s representative.  An area “equivalent to the size of South Africa” was lost to degradation each decade  while the global population continued to grow — most quickly in the worst hit areas.  Thus  a response was needed in the post-2015 agenda. Also speaking were representatives of Singapore  Algeria  Peru  Trinidad and Tobago  Mozambique  Guatemala  Iran  Kuwait  Ukraine  Nepal  Angola  Congo  Monaco  Libya  Morocco  Russian Federation  Lesotho  Philippines  Niger  Mongolia  Montenegro  United States  Micronesia  Turkey  Solomon Islands  El Salvador  Saudi Arabia  Zambia  Serbia  Burkina Faso and Cameroon. A representative of the Holy See also spoke. Also speaking were representatives of the International Labour Organization (ILO)  International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)  and the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The Second Committee will meet again at 3 p.m.  20 October to discuss the agenda item 23:  Eradication of poverty. Background The Second Committee (Economic and Financial) met this morning to continue its discussion of sustainable development.  For background information  see Press Release GA/EF/3400 of 15 October. Statements WILFRIED I. EMVULA (Namibia)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  reaffirmed his country’s commitment to achieving neutral land degradation as a sustainable development target.  Poverty eradication should remain the central and overarching objective of the post-2015 development agenda.  He reiterated the importance of strengthening global partnerships in order to achieve a transformative sustainable development  and urged for the negotiation of a new  legally binding agreement in 2015.  Noting that decertification was a major concern for his country  he called for the implementation of the Plan of Action and the Namib Declaration adopted at the eleventh Conference of Parties.  He emphasized the need for land-based approaches to adaptation to build climate shock resilience. CLARE CHOW (Singapore)  aligning with the Group of 77  and China  the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Alliance of Small Island States  said achieving sustainable development was about “learning to achieve more with less”.  Calling for clear  pragmatic and measurable targets under the post-2015 development agenda  she said Singapore would chart a path forward in the areas of urbanization  water and sanitation.  Singapore shared similar vulnerabilities with other small island developing States and  to implement the Samoa Pathway outcome document  had prepared a three-year technical cooperation package to provide customized assistance and fellowships in areas relevant to islands’ capacity-building needs. It also had placed sustainable development at the core if its own nation-building efforts. NASREDDINE RIMOUCHE (Algeria)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  noted the failure of industrialized countries to honour commitments on means of implementation of Agenda 21.  The proposal for a stand-alone sustainable development goal on means of implementation would help ensure commitments were met after 2015.  The intergovernmental committee on financing for development should conclude its work on establishing a facility for technology transfer.  The United Nations Framework Convention to Combat Desertification had “not fully achieved its goals” in its first decade and the strategy for 2010-2020 aimed to heighten efforts.  Algeria was a pilot country and had hosted a regional meeting.   The absence of international support for consolidation of national plans of action  particularly in Africa  had made it impossible to achieve the strategy’s goals.  Algeria was particularly exposed to desertification and was committed to tackling it.  He underlined the potential contribution of the biodiversity convention to development and called for greater recognition of the seriousness of biodiversity loss.  Partnerships and resources were vital to ensure the sustainable use of biological resources and Algeria had a law that would align with the Nagoya Protocol.  New and renewable sources of energy were at the heart of the Government’s action and the country ranked fifth in the world on capacity to provide solar power. MOHAMED ALSAHLAWI (United Arab Emirates)  aligning with the Group of 77 and China and the Arab Group  said  “We have to provide the resources necessary for enhancing international cooperation.”  His country was investing in sources of green energy and had been for more than 40 years.  There had been extensive investment in renewable energy  especially wind and solar power and great results had been recorded.  The United Arab Emirates had the largest solar energy plant in the world and it produced clean energy while contributing to emission reductions of around 20 per cent.  Developing countries needed “prompt solutions in order to achieve our development programmes while preserving the environment”  he said  noting that his country had contributed around $500 million in aid in that regard.  The International Renewable Energy Agency was located in Abu Dhabi and he pointed to the Africa Clean Energy Corridor and the small island developing States Lighthouses initiative as examples of its work.  He noted the 2020 Dubai Expo would help establish new partnerships on new and renewable energy and on water. IBRAHIMA SORY SYLLA (Senegal)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  noted that the July meeting of the High Level Political Forum had made clear the need for “a review of the way this institution operates”.  It had to improve its decision taking mechanism and should make clearer the different roles of participants in the Forum.  It further needed to adjust its agenda  and establish a better framework for follow-up.  The Forum should also discuss a technology transfer facilitation mechanism aiming to support developing countries  and could serve as a useful framework in which to discuss financing for development  a “crucial matter for countries in the South”.  Pointing to an irreversible degradation of forest ecosystems and biodiversity loss  he said the illicit trade in timber worsened that situation  and called for an International Fund for Forests and a legally binding agreement to help with protection. HAZEERAH ARIFFIN (Brunei Darussalam)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China and with ASEAN  said that other areas than the eradication of poverty were also important to the post-2015 development agenda.  One such area was the environment  and the protection of biological diversity.  Seventy-five per cent of her country’s land area was covered by tropical rainforests  and Brunei Darussalam had instituted several policies on environmental matters.  With Malaysia and Indonesia  the country was actively involved in a forest conservation initiative called the “Heart of Borneo”.  Another initiative aimed to protect marine biodiversity.  At a juncture where global demands were increasing  partnership and focus had to be increased on matters that could unite the international community. GUSTAVO MEZA-CUADRA (Peru)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  said the post-2015 development agenda must  among others  address the impacts of climate change  negative effects of energy demands  preservation of biodiversity  and sustainable forest management.  States must have the capacity to meet the goals  and must put the human being and the protection of human dignity at the core of the agenda.  Coming from a diverse country  he highlighted the importance of the sustainable use of biodiversity  and expressed concern about biopiracy.  Climate change had increased the frequency and intensity of disasters around the world  and it endangered the existence of societies and countries.  In view of that  he invited everyone to be part of the results of the upcoming Lima Conference. FRANCELLA STRICKLAND-SIMONET (Samoa)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  Alliance of Small Island States  Group of Pacific Small Island Developing States  and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  said that “as an existential issue to SIDS [small island developing States] low lying islands  sympathy and pity will not provide solace nor halt the devastating impacts of climate change”.  For her country  sea-level rise was of serious concern  given that 70 per cent of its population and infrastructure were located on low-lying coastal areas.  Since 1990  Samoa had experienced more frequent and severe weather events costing millions of dollars and forcing relocation of communities.  Thus  disaster risk reduction was of great importance.  As its heavy reliance on fossil fuels was a major source of economic vulnerability  Samoa was committed to achieving 20 per cent carbon neutrality by 2030  and would reduce its fossil fuels dependence by 10 per cent by 2016. RUEANNA HAYNES (Trinidad and Tobago) associated herself with the Group of 77 and China  CARICOM  Alliance of Small Island States  and CELAC.  She said that the post-2015 agenda should maintain a focus on monitoring and implementation with a view to building the capacity of developing countries to improve their data collection and statistical systems  so as to improve evidence-based decision-making.  Critical issues for small island developing States  such as the challenges related to graduation from the least developed country status  access to financing for sustainable development  energy security  trade imbalances  climate change  and sovereign debt  could only be addressed in the context of an effective global partnership for sustainable development. ANTONIO GUMENDE (Mozambique)  endorsing the statements made on behalf of the Group of 77 and China  African Group and the Group Least Developed Countries  said that given his country’s vulnerability to extreme climate events  its commitment to sustainable development and disaster risk reduction was not an option but a necessity for the population’s well-being.  As a result  current national strategies for poverty and disaster risk reduction addressed those issues in a crosscutting manner  promoting institutional coordination within the country and with other countries with which it shared waterways.  Improvement in early warning  preparedness  rapid response and resettlement for cyclones and floods had already been seen.  Under the climate change strategy  some 14 per cent of the population had been reached with renewable energy.  Supporting such efforts required strengthening international cooperation with particular attention to the transfer of technology  financing and capacity-building.  Those areas were the pillars for a sustainable and transformative post-2015 development agenda. MAHMADAMIN MAHMADAMINOV (Tajikistan)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said it would be impossible to achieve development goals without ensuring a reliable and universal access to energy.  It was also necessary to encourage the transfer of modern and advanced technologies and increase the efficiency in energy supply and conservation.  An integrated development of hydro-energy  coupled with the potential of other types of renewable energy  allowed not only increased capacities but also ensured sustainability  enhanced the efficiency of energy systems  and reduced emissions.  His country possessed the huge potential for hydro-energy and made every effort towards ensuring the integrated development of its energy sector. MARÍA SOLEDAD URRUELA ARENALES (Guatemala)  endorsing statements by the Group of 77 and China and CELAC  noted faithful compliance with efforts to implement Agenda 21  notably through the report of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals and the report on dialogues on a facilitation mechanism for the transfer and dissemination of environmentally friendly technologies.  The link between Agenda 21 and the post-2015 development agenda had to be acknowledged and the proposed facilitation mechanism could be a key means of implementation in achievement of the new agenda.  Disaster reduction was becoming a more and more prominent issue  with climate change increasing the regularity and severity of disasters.  Many people in Guatemala had been affected  with the State declaring a “public disaster” in the wake of huge gross domestic product (GDP) losses.  The upcoming conference on disaster risk reduction was therefore timely and its results would contribute to the post-2015 development agenda.  Guatemala was a biologically diverse country with a “rich cultural and natural legacy” and  though a low emitter of greenhouse gases  was making big changes to combat climate change. ALI HAJILARI (Iran)  associating with the Group of 77 and China  focused on issues that would “bug us down”  in the implementation of the post-2015 agenda.  Capacity-building should receive priority attention  notably through the exchange of experience  technology transfer and preferential policy treatment.  Systemic issues  such as policy space for developing countries or reform of the global financial system  should play a central role  while the root causes of slowed development  such as the imposition of unilateral economic measures  should be a focus.  Desertification  land degradation and drought were a serious concern for developing countries.  Sanctions imposed on Iran had impeded its ability to achieve the Hyogo Framework strategic goals. ABDULLAH A KH A KH ALSHARRAH (Kuwait)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Arab Group  urged the international community to continue its work on the three pillars of sustainable development.  His country had participated in all regional and international efforts under the auspices of the United Nations to achieve the post-2015 development agenda.  There must be an enhanced cooperation between all stakeholders  including the private sector  civil society and academic groups  and it was necessary to apply the results and outcomes of all conferences in the economic  social and environmental fields.  He also highlighted the need to focus on developing statistical systems and provide the data needed to measure the success of the sustainable development goals. NINO SHEKRILADZE (Georgia)  noting that her country was vulnerable to climate change  said the 2015 agreement should be legally binding  placing the world on track to achieve the “below 2°C” objective.  Committed to mitigating climate change  Georgia’s low-emission development strategy would offer an integrated pathway for sustainable development  while national appropriate mitigation actions were being prepared.  Vertical integration between the central Government and subnational and local governments was being enhanced.  More than 80 per cent of the country’s electricity was provided by renewable energy. YAROSLAV GOLITSYN (Ukraine) said his country welcomed the “Implementation of the Rio Conventions into National Sustainable Development Policy of Ukraine”.  The initiative  supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Ukraine and the Global Environment Facility  integrated sustainable development goals into the Ukrainian socioeconomic framework.  His country’s commitment to such development had been articulated through various multi-stakeholder initiatives.  As examples  he cited the international forum “Green Mind”  which served as a platform for discussing the national sustainable development strategy and the project “Local Community-oriented Development  which aimed to improve living conditions in the regions through a collaborative effort of local Governments  civil society organizations and the private sector. RITA DHITAL (Nepal)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  as well as the Group of Least Developed Countries  said the means of implementation outlined in Agenda 21  Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the Monterrey Consensus  among other documents  were “indispensable” for translating commitments into sustainable development outcomes.  The post-2015 agenda should be based on the principles of universal human rights  inclusiveness and sustainability  placing poverty eradication at the centre of such work.  Nepal looked forward to the creation of a legally binding climate instrument by 2015  having prepared a national adaption action programme.  Citing the need for technology transfer  knowledge sharing and innovation  she urged enhanced North-South  South-South and triangular cooperation. COURTENAY RATTRAY (Jamaica)  endorsing statements made on behalf of the Group of 77 and China  CARICOM  CELAC and the Alliance of Small Island States  said the three dimensions of sustainable development must be addressed in a balanced manner for the post-2015 agenda to be transformative.  As a small island developing State  Jamaica placed particular importance on the effective implementation of the programme for such States adopted at the Samoa conference.  He welcomed  in addition  support for efforts to manage the coastal and marine resources of the Caribbean Sea.  His country had made some advances in renewable energy but for success in the long run a better international framework was needed  including reliable transit of energy.  A global framework was also needed for greater progress in disaster resiliency.  He supported a strong climate agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to mobilize resources for adaption of vulnerable countries.  On the post-2015 agenda  he called for an implementation strategy that included a full exploration of options for development financing and attention to debt sustainability and trade issues. Mr. MUNUNGI (Democratic Republic of the Congo) associated with the Group of 77 and China  African Group  and the Group of Least Developed Countries  discussed several topics relate to natural disasters and risk reduction.  Disasters were occurring more regularly and their associated “consequences and losses of human life undermine the economy and ecology”  he said  noting their contribution to hunger and food insecurity.  “In just a few hours  a disaster can wipe out years of development ” he stated  pointing out that least developed countries were the most vulnerable and stressing the need to close the gap.  There was collective commitment to tackling disasters and he described efforts by the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) to establish a strategy on risk reduction and disaster management  and to adopt the Yaounde action plan for disaster response 2012-2017.  He described how the Yaounde plan approached the problem and also described several national and local level policies. MARGARIDA IZATA (Angola) noted that as the Millennium Development Goals had “not fully helped achieve” the international community ambitions  it was now necessary that the post-2015 development agenda provide the means for a more sustainable world.  Noting that her country lagged behind in the reduction of illiteracy rates by 2015  she welcomed the upcoming United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Conference on Education.  Angola had executed programmes to promote entrepreneurship  provide access to credit  and the means to convert the informal economy  and it had delivered acceptable results  creating new jobs  increasing tax revenue  and diversifying domestic production.  Drawing attention to energy as the driving force for sustainable development  she said that her country had been diversifying its national electric matrix through solar energy since 2011. MARÍA RUBIALES DE CHAMORRO (Nicaragua)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  and CELAC  said that to achieve the eradication of poverty  there must be means of implementation and a stronger global alliance based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.  Accordingly  she called on States to redouble their efforts to facilitate means of implementation and adequate financing for developing countries.  With extreme phenomena becoming more frequent and intense  they were all shouldering the costs of their adaptation and mitigation efforts.  A binding agreement must be reached in 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention to meet the challenges of climate change and protect the world’s ecosystems. PURNOMO A CHANDRA (Indonesia)  associating his delegation with the Group of 77 and China and ASEAN  said ending poverty was not just about boosting incomes but about efforts “to empower and enable the human spirit to reach its highest destiny”.  Globalization had led to emergence of several challenges that were now taking new forms and had “a sharper bite”.  The trend of middle-income poverty showed that inequality and inequity had increased markedly and could persist even after graduation from poverty.  The post-2015 agenda could tackle inequality through poverty eradication policies and inclusive  democratic global economic governance structures that effectively represented all regions.  It should be transformative  leaving no one behind  and should exist in an international economic environment conducive to its aims.  That meant multilateral cooperation on means of implementation  including finance  technology transfer and capacity building.  In that regard  he looked forward to successful discussions of the high level political forum on a technology facilitation mechanism.  The effects of climate change also needed to be addressed.  Despite the shortcomings of globalization  it had also given birth to a “cyber-aware generation” that was more exposed to global issues. APPOLINAIRE DINGHA (Congo)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  said that Africa had the largest number of countries that would not reach certain Millennium Development Goals by the 2015 deadline.  He welcomed progress made on the General Assembly resolution 68/210 on the implementation of Agenda 21  which was one of his country’s priorities.  In that context  Congo had set up a structural framework for developing a national sustainable development strategy  which involved all parties  including the public sector  civil society  and local and indigenous populations.  His country had been a party to the Convention on Biological Diversity since 1996  and had signed the Nagoya Protocol  whose provisions benefited Congo’s local and indigenous communities.  Congo was also committed to the preservation of its natural resources  and to the conservation of its parks and natural reservations. CELINE VANKLAVEREN-IMPAGLIAZZO (Monaco) said his country would contribute to the Green Climate Fund and would actively participate in climate negotiations in Lima and Paris.  The Government would strengthen its national policies which included a climate and energy plan.  She supported a sustainable development goal on oceans and seas in accordance with the proposals of the Open Working Group  underscoring that global survival was linked to oceans.  People around the world depended upon them for food security and other issues vital to sustainable development.  Oceans had to remain healthy and productive but they suffered from acidification because of greenhouse gases.  An expert report had shown that the world economy could lose up to $1 trillion if urgent measures were not taken to deal with acidification.  Monaco was working in the Mediterranean Sea to conserve protected marine areas.  An ambitious development agenda would depend upon financing and she looked forward to the upcoming conference on financing for development. ABDULMONEM A.H. ESHANTA (Libya)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  African Group  and the Arab Group  supported the Economic and Social Council Ministerial Declaration from July 2013 along with several other processes and conference outcomes.  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) needed enhancement and support  while it was necessary to ensure support for the Green Climate Fund.  Libya was a semi-desert country and suffered from a lack of water and suffered the effects of desertification and land degradation.  He called for efforts to tackle the issue through the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification  Particularly in Africa. Mr. ACHARGUI (Morocco)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  African Group  and the Arab Group  stated that  without strong political will based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities  aspects of sustainable development would remain “an elusive dream” for developing countries.  Small island developing States faced difficulties in applying the Mauritius and Barbados agreements and he appreciated the work done to formulate the Samoa Pathway.  His Government had implemented several policies related to sustainable development  including laws that had been embodied in the 2011 Constitution  which confirmed the right of citizens to live in a healthy environment.  Investment in solar energy was extensive and aimed to ensure that 20 per cent of energy would come from that source by 2020.  Other projects were geared towards the preservation of natural resources and protection of ecological resources  oceans and forest. TLHALEFO MADISA (Botswana) said his country was committed to the protection of its natural environment as evidenced by the 17 per cent of land area it had set aside as national parks  wildlife management areas  and game and forest reserves to ensure the protection and conservation of biodiversity.  It was also party to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance for which the Okavango Delta had been designated as the country’s first Ramsar site.  His country  like the rest of sub-Saharan Africa  faced the severe threats of climate change  desertification  land degradation and drought.  That not only reversed the economic and social gains it had made thus far  but debilitated its efforts to address the needs of its population.  As such  it had embarked on the development of a comprehensive national climate change policy and strategy for sustainable development  both of which would chart a transition towards a low-carbon  climate resilient environment for his country. DILYARA S. RAVILOVA-BOROVIK (Russian Federation) was against a broader definition of the sustainable development concept and politicization of the agenda.  Her country had consistently increased the amount of assistance given to small island developing States.  Amounting to approximately $20 million over the past years  it had focused on modernizing economic infrastructure  strengthening State governance  improving education systems  health care and energy security  and increasing disaster resilience.  The Russian Federation was committed to fighting desertification  supported the Convention on Biological Diversity  and welcomed measures aimed at strengthening the role of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). KELEBONE MAOPE (Lesotho)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  African Group  and the Group of Least Developed Countries  said a new set of universal sustainable development goals must be concise and strong on means of implementation.  It must also respect national ownership and national conditions of each State.  His country’s ecosystems were sensitive to the effects of climate change  and extreme weather patterns  such as droughts and desertification  had caused significant economic damage.  He urged development partners to simplify the accessibility of funds earmarked for climate change initiatives.  Lesotho’s land had been degraded due to poor land use and inability to access rain water.  Such degradation had resulted in poor agricultural productivity.  In that context  he called for a land-based approach to adaptation  which would seek to restore the land’s productive capacity  and would help build resilience to climate shocks. LIBRAN CABACTULAN (Philippines)  aligning himself with the Group of 77 and ASEAN  said inadequate financing and insufficient official development assistance (ODA) had been obstacles to his country’s development.  Growth of its GDP had not generated new jobs fast enough  thereby limiting the country’s capacity to realize the Millennium Development Goals.  However  through public-private partnerships  his country had been able to sustain its national cash transfer programmes aimed at addressing poverty and mitigating the adverse effects of disasters.  As one of the world’s disaster-prone countries  the Philippines looked forward to the immediate mobilization of $100 billion per year by 2020  as agreed at the 2010 Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC  to support mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing countries. ADA MOUSSA (Niger) aligned with the Group of 77 and China  African Group  Group of Least Developed Countries and the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries.  In 1984  Niger had launched a national environment policy  establishing a national council on the environment.  The “Renaissance Programme” stressed the need for action on infrastructure  basic social services  agricultural development and climate change adaptation.  An economic and social development plan  the “We feed ourselves” plan and a strategy for developing the Sahel were adopted under the Programme.  Niger faced many challenges  including its landlocked nature  prevalence of desert  fast population growth and modest resource endowment.  The Millennium Development Goals would not be achieved “despite enormous efforts made”  while new goals would not change things without mobilization of means of implementation.  The Istanbul Programme of Action should be implemented synergistically with the sustainable development goals and the upcoming landlocked developing countries conference should yield an outcome commensurate with needs of those countries. MARÍA MJÖLL JÓNSDÓTTIR (Iceland) said many countries now recognized the need for sustainable land management.  An area “equivalent to the size of South Africa” was lost to degradation each decade  while global population continued growing — most quickly in the worst hit areas.  A response was needed in the post-2015 agenda.  Overfishing remained problematic but could be countered with better infrastructure and management.  She supported a separate sustainable development goal on oceans but stressed the need to base it on existing laws  particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.  Harnessing renewable energy resources would allow technological progress without harming the planet.  Iceland used hydro and geothermal to supply electricity and heating  but globally only 14 per cent of geothermal potential was harnessed.  In East Africa alone  it could bring new  clean  sustainable energy to more than over 150 million people within a few years.  Iceland joined the Geothermal Compact to transfer technology to developing countries.  In addition  sustainable development could only be achieved with progress on gender equality and legal and economic empowerment of women. ENKHTSETSEG OCHIR  Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Mongolia  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  supported the High-level Political Forum as the main platform for monitoring the sustainable development goals.  The Open Working Group report could have better reflected the special needs of landlocked developing countries and she looked forward to the Secretary-General’s synthesis report later this year.  A transformative development agenda must go hand-in-hand with outlining its means of implementation  she said  reiterating the importance of financing for sustainable development  technology transfer and capacity-building.  Mongolia was carrying out a project to enhance local capacities for disaster risk reduction  management and coordination. MILORAD ŠĆEPANOVIĆ (Montenegro)  associating himself with the European Union  said his country’s commitment to sustainable development was made evident by the establishment earlier this year of the Centre for Sustainable Development which merged the knowledge  expertise and resources of national institutions and UNDP.  Its key mission would be aligned with his country’s needs and those of Western Balkan countries and focus specifically on sustainable tourism  sustainable energy  managing resources and ecosystems  as well as climate change adaptation and environmental safety.  He hoped that the Centre would be recognized as an important regional mechanism and internationally as part of the post Rio+20 network of sustainable development centres.  The High-Level Regional Conference on Sustainable Development would be held in his country in November 2014. Ms. HAMILTON (United States) said the post-2015 development agenda was a tremendous opportunity and instrument to eradicate extreme poverty in a generation. Equally important was a commitment to put all societies on a sustainable path.  Climate change was one of the highest priorities.  As the international community prepared for the UNFCCC conference in Lima  the commitments already made by Governments was encouraging.  Her country remained committed to an ambitious  durable and flexible agreement in 2015  and would work to ensure adaptations to the impacts of climate change got the emphasis they deserved.  The United States were also committed to work in partnership to achieve sustainable development of small island developing States of all regions. She emphasized the value of discipline in the Committee’s work  which should remain focused on essentials and should defer to other processes when appropriate. JEEM LIPPWE (Micronesia)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and the Alliance of Small Island States  said that for small islands to survive  the rise in temperature must be kept at well below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.  Without urgent action  the cost of economic damage would increase and  at worst  lead to the demise of the country’s islands.  In that regard  his Government had made an important proposal to amend the Montreal Protocol in order to gradually phase down the production and consumption of hydroflourocarbons.  A reduction in hydrofluorocarbons could prevent the global average temperature increase by up to 0.5°C by the end of the century.  In addition  reducing hydrofluorocarbons and other short-lived climate pollutants could reduce the rate of sea-level rise by 25 per cent.  Such near-term climate mitigation would give all atolls around the globe a chance to survive. YAVUZ SELIM ÇUBUKCU (Turkey) said the global population would reach 9 billion by 2050 creating “unprecedented pressure on the resources of our planet”.  A billion people were still undernourished; pollution continued; biodiversity was declining; and environmental degradation was widespread.  Vulnerabilities and specific challenges of countries in special situations had to be addressed without delay and the Turkish International Cooperation Agency was actively engaged in development work with such States.  His country had hosted the fourth conference on least developed countries in 2011 and was ready to host the mid-term review conference.  Attaching great importance to the establishment of a Technology Bank  his country supported enhanced cooperation on science  technology and innovation  particularly for least developed countries  and including hosting of the Bank. HELEN BECK (Solomon Islands)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  Alliance of Small Island States  and the Group of Least Developed Countries  said that by 2030  89 per cent of the world’s coral reefs were projected to experience severe bleaching.  Such events would impact tourism  among other industries  potentially driving households in small island developing States and least developed countries into “poverty traps”.  Concerned about the lack of progress in climate change negotiations  she pressed the Committee to invite the UNFCCC to hold those talks in New York.  Disaster risk reduction partners should support the State disaster institution  rather than provide funds to international non-governmental organizations  which had their own agenda. RUBÉN IGNACIO ZAMORA RIVAS (El Salvador)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and CELAC  said poverty eradication was the greatest problem facing the world  and a prerequisite for sustainable development.  Thus  the international community must speed up its work to tackle the impending issues of the Millennium Development Goals.  Concerning climate change  it was time to get verifiable commitments from all countries  particularly those responsible for it.  He noted that El Salvador was aiming to increase the amount of electricity from renewable energy sources to 20 per cent by 2020.  It already had its first national climate change plan  which included adaptation and mitigation.  With support from developed countries and swift operationalization of the Green Climate Fund it would be able to counter losses resulting from climate change. Mr. DAYEM (Saudi Arabia)  noting his country was a major partner in international development  said foreign assistance and aid were major aspects of its foreign policy.  During the last 40 years  his country’s foreign assistance exceeded the United Nations GDP target for donor countries.  It had provided soft loans to developing countries  contributed $1 billion to the Islamic Fund to combat poverty  and had forgiven $6 billion in loans to the developing countries.  Furthermore  Saudi Arabia had announced a $500 million energy initiative  which was started by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques during the Energy Conference in Jeddah. MWABA P. KASESE-BOTA (Zambia)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  the African Group and the least developed countries  said the creation of wealth and decent jobs was one of the challenges his Government faced.  However  due to the implementation of multiple poverty interventions  it was widely anticipated that the country’s poverty levels would show notable progress when it concluded its next poverty survey in 2015.  Although the degradation of land and natural resources had undermined people’s living conditions and had greatly affected the country’s capacity for food production  he said his Government had addressed such issues by promoting sustainable land management strategies  including climate-smart agriculture to ensure increased food production and food security. LIDIJA BUBANJA (Serbia) said her country’s pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals had been “less successful” than expected  with the poverty rate — once halved — again rising due to the economic crisis  and an increase in unemployment.  As such  it was imperative to pursue sustainable development.  Serbia looked forward to the Secretary-General’s synthesis report.  Poverty eradication remained a priority and the Government was devising a development agenda framework for 2016-2020 with the United Nations country team.  “Sustainable development cannot be achieved if we do not achieve peaceful and inclusive societies”  she said  citing the need to promote the rule of law at all levels  provide justice for all and build effective institutions nationally and internationally. MAMADOU COULIBALY (Burkina Faso)  aligning his delegation with the Group of 77 and China  the African Group and the Group of Least Developed Countries  pointed out that one-fifth of the world’s population and thousands of hectares of fertile soil was affected by desertification  degradation and drought as a result of climate change.  In the Sahel  the situation was alarming  with natural resources and environmental wealth suffering degradation.  Activity  including agricultural over-exploitation  deforestation for fuel and animal husbandry had evident negative repercussions on the land and the living conditions of people living in rural areas.  The National Action Plan for Adaptation included studies of vulnerabilities in various areas  and found people in rural areas living in a “vicious circle” where production methods harmed soil fertility and crop yields.  More efficient strategies were needed to combat the issues properly and national strategy had been agreed upon in 1999  building capacities of local populations to combat desertification and degradation.  It included efforts to encourage reforestation  environmental codes and regulation of plastic bags and packaging.  He was pleased that desertification  degradation and drought were part of the Rio outcome and included in the report of the Open Working Group on sustainable development goals. ALAIN WILFRIED BIYA (Cameroon)  aligning his delegation with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  welcomed pledges to the Green Climate Fund but noted that $100 billion was needed annually to enable adaptation and emissions reductions.  Delays would increase developing countries’ burdens.  Desertification  degradation and drought worsened poverty and caused multiple challenges.  They irreversibly affected the earth’s capacities  increased the fragility of food security  and put at risk the very survival of biodiversity and ecosystems.  National policies on forest resources were to the fore; forests were one of the “main foundations of economic development” in Cameron as the third largest contributor to the country’s GDP.  The sector employed 170 000 people and forests covered 22 million hectares.  The aim was to preserve forestry’s many functions and to keep alive traditional knowledge.  Cameroon had an extensive biodiversity policy but was “not just bending to international pressure”.  Rather  his country deliberately took personal responsibility  and more international solidarity should respond to that.  Turning to poaching and the illicit trade in animals  he said support for national efforts was needed. BERNARDITO AUZA  Permanent Observer of the Holy See  said climate change was not only an environmental question  but also a question of justice and a moral imperative.  It was a matter of justice to help poor and vulnerable people suffering the most from causes largely not of their making and beyond their control.  A concrete step in that regard would be to make available to them the best in adaptation and mitigation technology.  The “responsibility to protect” was relevant not only in the humanitarian and human rights arena  but also in climate change.  Noting that everyone shared the responsibility to protect the planet and the human family  he encouraged all to conscientiously refrain from lifestyles and behaviour that would worsen the state of the planet and  instead  promote initiatives that would protect and heal it. DINO CORELL  International Labour Organization (ILO)  said two of today’s most pervasive challenges included averting the destructive threats posed by climate change and delivering decent work to all  especially to unemployed youth and working poor.  The transition to a greener economy was not only critical from an environmental perspective  but also made perfect economic and social sense.  A greener economy could lead to gains in terms of improved livelihoods  social inclusion and more and better jobs.  Stressing that people must be placed at the core of policymaking  he said the Decent Work Agenda offered a coherent policy framework that integrated macroeconomic employment and the social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. AJAY MADIWALE  International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)  said that in 2013  disasters affected more than 96 million people  causing $192 billion in global economic losses.  The post-2015 framework for disaster risk reduction must prioritize building the resilience of poor and marginalized groups  focus on the community and local levels  emphasize the implementation of risk management laws and be backed by adequate  targeted and long-term funding.  “Without this  it will simply be words on a page ” he said. NARINDER KAKAR  International Union for Conservation of Nature  said work carried out under the Convention for Biological Diversity  especially the elaboration of indicators for the Aichi Biodiversity Targets  must be an integral part of the indicator framework for tracking progress towards achievement of the sustainable development goals.  More coordination was needed to ensure policy coherence between those goals and national biodiversity strategies.  Further  the means of implementation for attaining the goals must include appropriate investment into conservation  restoration and biodiversity management. MICHELE KLEIN SOLOMON  International Organization for Migration  said the inclusion of migration in the report of the Open Working Group marked a critical step towards ensuring a place for that issue in the post-2015 agenda  properly reflecting an understanding of human mobility and its contribution to development.  Migration was among the most powerful and immediate strategies for poverty reduction  offering a lifeline for more than 1 billion people today.  Diaspora groups and transnational communities were vital to the facilitation of trade and investment among countries.  At the global level  migration was a key factor mediating the supply and demand of labour. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-16,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaspd561.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The disarmament and space communities should coordinate with each other to build transparency and confidence as the world sought ways of promoting sustainable development through space-based tools  the Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) heard today  as it continued its discussions on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space. Urging the Conference on Disarmament to continue its efforts towards the long-term sustainability of outer-space activities  the representative of Switzerland said that body could join the Fourth Committee in presenting its work to the General Assembly next year  and at a joint  ad hoc meeting of the Fourth and First Committees (Disarmament and International Security). Outer space should not be separated from disarmament issues  but its use should be prohibited for military purposes  the representative of Jordan said  calling for binding  international  legal instruments to ensure that realm was used to tackle such challenges as water-resource management  climate change  health  and food security. Several speakers highlighted the importance of exchanging expertise and knowledge  as others called for limiting the use of outer space to peaceful purposes.  Stressing the need for sustained international unity for the peaceful harnessing of outer space  the representative of the Russian Federation said space laws should keep pace with modern realities. He also highlighted the need to address the challenge of space debris and welcomed cooperation in that regard. The representative of China recalled that his country and the Russian Federation had jointly tabled at the Conference on Disarmament a new draft treaty on the prevention of the deployment of weapons in outer space  as well as the threat or use of force against outer space objects. The country was ready to continue its cooperation with all parties to advance negotiations for an outer-space arms control treaty. Emphasizing that weaponization of outer space would be a major threat to all mankind  the representative of Iran said all efforts should be made to ensure its peaceful purposes use only. The contribution to space activities for sustainable development should be considered in line with the post-2015 agenda. The representative of Argentina  noting that his country was launching its first  indigenously-built  geo-stationary satellite today  marking a milestone for the country and region  stressed the importance of sharing knowledge and information. Also speaking today were the representatives of Malaysia  Japan  Iraq  Saudi Arabia and Algeria. The Committee will meet at 10 a.m.  Friday  17 October  to conclude its annual consideration of the agenda item. Background The Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) met today to continue its annual debate on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space. For background  see Press Release GA/SPD/560 of 15 October. Statements NAZARI ABD HADI (Malaysia)  associating with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  said that his country had made significant progress with the launching of its satellite last year  and was now embarking on its next satellite launch project.  In terms of its space infrastructure  Malaysia had completed its satellite manufacturing facility — the Assembly  Integration and Testing Facility — whose establishment aimed to provide the regional and global space community with production and testing services.  He also invited all to “experience” the facility under the purview of the National Space Agency of Malaysia.  Reiterating Malaysia’s commitment to enhancing international cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space  he noted that space technology improved daily lives.  It was addressing a range of social and economic challenges  including poverty eradication  environmental protection  and disaster management. NAOKI TAKAHASHI (Japan) said that space-based technology had become indispensable in providing numerous services such as telecommunication and navigation.  International cooperation was key to developing peaceful activities in space  and Japan recognized the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space as the international platform enhancing cooperation on outer space.  He added that the Committee was securing long-term sustainability of outer-space activity  and had contributed considerably to tackling global issues of concern.  Several conferences had been held  including regional summits  hosted by Indonesia and the United States.  Japan had held a workshop under the auspices of ASEAN.  The aim was to strengthen long-term stability and safety in space.  He added that the Asia-Pacific Regional Space Agency Forum played a key role in returning the benefits of outer space technology to the Asian region.  He was pleased to acknowledge Japan’s successes in that regard  and reiterated his country’s commitment to the peaceful use of outer space. FRÉDÉRIC MARC-ANDRÉ TISSOT-DAGUETTE (Switzerland)  welcoming the progress made towards the long-term sustainability of outer-space activities  stressed his commitment to actively work on establishing a complete  coherent  and realistic set of guidelines.  It was important that the disarmament and the space communities coordinate with each other to translate into action the recommendations of the Group of Governmental Experts on transparency and confidence-building measures. He said the Conference on Disarmament should also continue its efforts on the long-term sustainability of outer-space activities.  The results of the work of the two bodies could be presented to the General Assembly next year  and at a joint  ad hoc meeting of the Fourth and First Committees (Disarmament and International Security).  Switzerland supported the opening of formal negotiations on the process initiated by the European Union for developing an international code of conduct for outer space  based on inclusive participation and comprising both civil and military activities.  Such a code  among other things  should ensure the equality of treatment between the participating international organizations and respect for their legal “personality”. SADIQ AL-RIKABI (Iraq) endorsed all initiatives calling for the peaceful use of outer space.  His delegation also called for transparent and equal access to that realm  with a focus on sustainability and disaster management.  Iraq had made significant achievements  he said  highlighting examples of international cooperation in outer space technology to help sustainable development.  He described several agreements put in place in his country  including with the Italian Government for the development of small satellites; with the European Union for surveying ground water in Iraq  where drought was a major problem; as well as with the Republic of Korea and the United States. SONIA ISHAQ AHMAD SUGHAYAR (Jordan) said it was of paramount importance to create a universal understanding on the safe and responsible conduct of space activities and applications.  Outer space should only be maintained for peaceful uses and development of space-based technology in order to contribute to advancing economies and people’s lives.  In view of the remarkable increase in States’ activities in space  greater coordination and a regulatory framework were needed  taking into consideration State sovereignty and the boundary between their airspace and outer space.  The application of norms and international laws relevant to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes should be ensured.  Outer space should not be separated from disarmament  but its use should be prohibited for military purposes.  Jordan called for setting up binding  international  legal instruments to ensure that outer space was used peacefully to tackle such challenges as water-resource management  climate change  health  and food security.  The number of countries and organizations engaged in the issues had increased in recent years  she said  underlining the importance of collaborative efforts and better communication and interaction to bridge the knowledge and expertise gap. HOSSEIN MALEKI (Iran) expressed his appreciation for efforts by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs to promote international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space.  As one of the 24 founding members of the Outer Space Committee  Iran attached high importance to the issue  and believed that the domain should be kept open to all States for peaceful purposes.  The weaponization of outer space would be a major threat to all mankind  and all countries were responsible for preventing an outer space arms race or any other misuse of that realm.   The contribution of space activities for sustainable development should be considered in line with the post-2015 agenda.  He emphasized that any code of conduct for outer-space activities should be comprehensive and peaceful in nature  and within the United Nations legal framework.  He reiterated his position on the geostationary orbit as a limited source  and underscored that the utilization of the orbit spectrum must be rationalized.  On the question of space system-based disaster management  he said Iran was facing various types of natural disasters  and he recognized the merit of the UN-SPIDER programme in addressing their management.  Iran had made remarkable advances in space science and technology  having placed its first domestic data processing satellite in orbit.  The country was determined to continue such progress and to contribute to promoting international cooperation in the field. CARLOS MARÍA VALLARINO (Argentina)  speaking in his national capacity  stressed that outer space must be used rationally and for peaceful purposes for the generations to come.  The use of space technology should be universal.  He highlighted the achievements of Earth observation satellites in diverse aspects of development  and emerging partnerships between Argentina and other nations and organizations  stressing the importance of strategic partnerships.  International cooperation was central to developing space science and technologies and their application  he said  underlining the priority Argentina placed on the exchange of knowledge and information.  Access to outer space use should be equitable  he said  emphasizing the full implementation of international law.  Argentina was today launching its first  indigenously-built  geo-stationary satellite  marking a milestone for the country and region. NASSER SULTAN AL-SUBAIE (Saudi Arabia)  welcoming international conventions and United Nations resolutions on the topic  urged States’ adherence to those texts.  Calling for an international code of conduct  he stressed the urgency to further efforts to prevent the militarization of outer space.  Cooperation on addressing space debris was also vital.  Saudi Arabia had launched its thirteenth satellite based on cooperation between organizations in his country and the United States  he said  and emphasized the importance of such cooperation to improve people’s lives.  The geo-stationary orbit was a natural source of science and technology in space  in a manner beneficial to all States. SHANG ZHEN (China)  appreciating the significant role of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in areas such as regulating space activities  maintaining space order  and promoting space cooperation  supported the Committee’s involvement in formulating the post-2015 development agenda.  Long-term sustainability had a bearing on the endeavours of mankind as a whole  and he  thus  called for joint action by the international community.  The draft guide for the working group should be based on consensus and aimed at promoting Member States’ efforts to develop space use  participation in international cooperation  and expand space applications.  Care must be taken to avoid going beyond Member States’ levels of development  technical capability  and management of their respective space industries.  Non-legally binding instruments on outer space within the United Nations framework were a useful supplement to the legal system on outer space. Upholding the principles of equality and mutual benefit  peaceful use and common development  China actively engaged in international exchanges and cooperation.  Highlighting new achievements by China’s space industry  he said the technology had been widely applied to various fields such as meteorology  mapping  agriculture  land  sea  environmental protection  disaster mitigation  communication  and broadcasting.  He recalled that China and the Russian Federation had jointly tabled at the Conference on Disarmament a new draft treaty on the prevention of the deployment of weapons in outer space  as well as the threat or use of force against outer space objects  The country was ready to continue its cooperation with all parties to advance negotiations for an outer-space arms control treaty. DJAMEL MOKTEFI (Algeria) said that his country adopted its national space programme as a means to accelerate the development of social and economic goals while advancing international and regional cooperation in the field of space technology.  The programme’s activities had intensified in 2014.  For example  Algeria had started its first operation for satellite integration  and begun development on the integration of a second satellite.  Regarding space application  several projects had been developed in various sectors  including managing major risks and natural disasters.  At the regional level  his country supported all cooperation to advance sustainable development in Africa.  It followed with great interest the issues raised by the Outer Space Committee.  He stressed the need to define outer space activities  guarantee equal access  and reduce space debris. SERGEY A. LEONIDCHENKO (Russian Federation) said sustained international unity was required for peacefully harnessing of outer space.  His country had a multidimensional cooperation framework in such areas as the international space station and global navigation systems.  The Russian Federation was committed to further cooperation and compatibilities  and welcomed partners.  Strengthening the security of outer space would facilitate sustainability  he stressed  adding that the Russian Federation was actively involved in developing international guidelines.  The UN-SPIDER programme continued to make a valuable contribution in the promotion of knowledge and information.  The Russian Federation was working in the context of its national legislation to address the issue of space debris  he said  adding that outer space laws that were in keeping with modern realities would contribute to the peaceful use of outer space for the common benefit. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.

2014-10-15,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaspd560.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Equitable access to and effective harnessing of space knowledge and technology were critical to the success of the post-2015 sustainable development agenda  the Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) heard today  as it began its consideration of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space. Indeed  the benefits of space technology applications and the use of space-derived data and information were important tools for meeting global development needs  said Committee Chair  Durga Prasad Bhattarai ahead of a panel discussion today. He noted it had been agreed by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space at its fifty-seventh session this year. The Committee heard that  while tremendous but uneven progress had been broadly made on the Millennium Development Goals  many least developed countries were far off track and unlikely to meet their targets.  Even if those were achieved  they would be only a start  because the Goals  for example  were about halving poverty  not eradicating it.  Efforts were under way to identify and implement technological platforms  including space tools  in support of the much broader sustainable development goals. The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs  the Committee was told  worked on four pillars: space economy that created and provided value; space society in a social sustainable environment; space accessibility for the benefit of every human being; and space diplomacy to establish knowledge-based  international partnerships. Also discussed were Algeria’s space programme and its contributions to reinforcing national and regional capacity with applications in such diverse areas as agriculture  town planning  water  and infrastructure. In the interactive dialogue that followed  the representative of Iran asked how the UN-SPIDER knowledge portal had been assisting Member States in developing countries and what feedback had been received. He also asked how Iran’s space agencies benefited from such networks. Noting the frequent natural disasters his country faced  the representative of Chile said previous panels had not led to concrete plans for regional cooperation on addressing such disasters.  The representative of Somalia asked how his country could best benefit from the information presented  particularly given its series of droughts and floods. In response  the Committee heard  among other things  that UN-SPIDER was working to reach out to more countries  be “more present” overall  and follow up with beneficiary countries. After the panel discussion  the Chair of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space presented its report  stressing that the body had made “extraordinary contributions” and was serving as a “unique platform” for international cooperation.  Regular mechanisms played a vital role in enhancing cooperation between space-faring States and others in the interest of common benefit  he added. When the floor was opened for statements  the representative of Thailand  speaking on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  stressed the indispensability of regional and international cooperation in space promotion  and encouraged developed countries to assist developing ones in order to fill the knowledge gap.  Following the tsunamis of 2004  ASEAN recognized the utility of space-based data in improving early-warning systems and rescue operations  he said.  Speaking in his national capacity  the representative called for an all-inclusive and transparent approach to finalizing an international code of conduct for outer space activities. Speaking on behalf of Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR)  the representative of Argentina stressed the sovereign right of every State to develop outer space for the benefits of human development.  That  he said  should be done on an equal footing without allowing anyone to appropriate or militarize outer space. The representative of the European Union Delegation  highlighting the group’s unique space capabilities that made it a world-class leader  underscored his commitment to developing an international code of conduct.  He called on all States to join the Union in concluding that multilateral process  as such an instrument would make an “indispensable contribution to enhancing the safety  security and sustainability of outer space activities”. The representative of Chile  pointing to a “Gordian knot” in terms of space legislation  said some key treaties were the product of the security-dominated cold-war era  whereas today’s world was one of global cooperation and new technologies.  There was a need to build capacity to consume the abundance of information available  he said  stressing the imperative of developing a conceptual framework on the global commons. Also making statements were the representatives of Israel  Guatemala and Mexico. The Committee will meet again at 10 a.m.  Wednesday  16 October  to resume consideration of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space. Background The Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) met this morning for a panel discussion on international cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space and to begin its annual debate on the agenda item.  Before the Committee were documents A/69/20 and A/C.4/69/L.2. Panel Discussion The panellists comprised Azzedine Oussedik  Director General of the Algerian Space Agency and the Chair of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space; Simonetta Di Pippo  Director of the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the Secretariat; and David O’Connor  Chief Policy and Analysis Branch of the Division for Sustainable Development  Department of Economic and Social Affairs. In brief opening remarks  Committee Chair Mr. Durga Prasad Bhattarai noted that the panel discussion  agreed by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space at its fifty-seventh session earlier in the year  said the benefits of space technology applications and the use of space-derived data and information provided important tools for meeting global development needs. Mr. O’Connor  speaking on sustainable development goals as a central tenet of the post-2015 agenda  said there was tremendous but uneven progress on the Millennium Development Goals.  There were still many least developed countries far off track and not likely to meet their targets.  Even if those were achieved  that would only be a start  because the Goals were about halving poverty  and not eradicating it.  The Rio+20 Conference stressed implementation mechanisms  including financing and technology use.  As part of promoting science-policy interface  the Open Working Group had forwarded its proposals to the General Assembly  which made them part of the post-2015 agenda. As the Sustainable Development Goals broadened the Millennium Development Goals and targets  he said  efforts were under way to identify and implement technological platforms to bolster that agenda.  One input to the Secretary-General’s proposals in advance of the September 2015 summit included the role and use of data in the promotion of various dimensions of sustainable development.  To measure progress  there was a need for relevant indicators  which the United Nations was currently working on identifying.  Also being explored were ways of incorporating non-conventional sources of data to support indicators  including real-time information through the use of new technologies. Speaking next  Ms. Di Pippo  highlighted the emergence and evolution of her Office and described achievements  including treaties and agreements governing outer space.  The Office was working towards promoting peaceful uses of outer space through workshops  initiatives  fellowships  and regional centres.  Its “UN-SPIDER” network allowed all countries to benefit from knowledge and initiatives developed in the area  she added. At the same time  she said  the Office implemented the decisions of the General Assembly and of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.  She highlighted the capability-building activities and workshops in support of the Millennium Development Goals and application of space technology. Outer space could also be used as a catalyst for development.  There was a clear reference in the Rio+20 agenda to the importance of space-based data for sustainable development goals and ways of achieving them.  Space could be used in a helpful way in all main topics in that area  she said  underscoring its specific role in capacity-building. Turning to disaster management  she said the UN-SPIDER programme was helping countries in response and recovery  and creating a bridge between providers and users of information.  Ways of using Earth observation technology to promote sustainable development would be discussed at a conference in Bonn next year.  The strategic choices for space use were: promoting space technology applications  improving the safety of space operations  and interlinking science  technology  policy and law for space activities.  The Office was working on four pillars: space economy that created and provided value; space society in a social sustainable environment; space accessibility for the benefit of every human being; and space diplomacy to establish knowledge-based international partnerships. In his presentation  Mr. Oussedik spoke about Algeria’s space programme  which comprised space applications  projects  and facilities.  The Algerian Earth observation satellite  Alsat-1  launched in 2002  had been the first of five satellites of the Disaster Monitoring Constellation.  Its successor  launched in 2010  reinforced national capacity by building a satellite development centre  and mobilizing and training Algerian engineers.  The Alcomsat-1 initiative was aimed at promoting autonomy and responding to national knowledge needs in communication technology.  The African Resource Management Satellite Constellation — a regional consortium — was being developed to broaden the use of space technology.  Further versions of the programme were envisaged into the next decade and beyond. Algeria  he went on  was engaged in bilateral cooperation with Argentina  United Kingdom  France  Russian Federation  India  Republic of Korea  South Africa  Malaysia  and China  and was working out initiatives with the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States (NASA).  In addition  the country was involved in several multilateral space cooperation frameworks  he said.  Also  development agencies in Algeria were using services in pursuit of diverse areas of development  including agriculture  town planning  water  and infrastructure.  Countries in the region were also benefiting from Algerian space imagery in different areas  he said  highlighting the role of the ASAL-Observatory of Sahara and Sahel project  which aimed at promoting resilience of the populations there. The representative of Iran  in the discussion that followed  asked questions about UN-SPIDER  particularly concerning its emergency response.  He wondered what exactly were the services and assistance rendered to developing countries  and what feedback had been received from those countries.  He also wondered if there were any networks dealing with natural disasters and  specifically  how Iran’s space agencies could benefit from such networks. The representative of Chile commended this morning’s presentations noting that his country had organized a number of panels.  Unfortunately  Chile was one of the countries with the most natural disasters and earthquakes.  He said previous panels had provided similar information  but those had not led to a plan or projection for regional cooperation or the launch of projects on natural disasters.  He recalled that no convention on natural disasters had been put in place following the panels  while the victims of natural disasters continued to suffer.  He hoped that a legal framework and concrete actions devoted to developing countries and the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda would follow. The representative of Somalia asked how best his country could benefit from the information presented.  Somalia  he said  had a problem of drought and flooding  and he asked what plan could be put in place to address that. Ms. Di Pippo  noting that delegates’ questions had focused mainly on the UN-SPIDER programme  described what had been done to improve its activities.  UN-SPIDER had been well-developed and funded from available resources  but it still needed to expand its activities by reaching out to more countries and being “more present” overall.  Concerning Iran’s question on feedback  she stated that one of the goals for next year was to establish further follow up with the countries they were working with  and improve the monitoring and measurement of the activities put in place.  She recalled that the UN-SPIDER  with only two main contributors  needed additional funding and more contributors and donors  so as to develop a strategic plan and support more countries. Presentation of Report Mr. OUSSEDIK  Chair of the Committee for the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space  presenting the report of the Committee  stressed its activities during the past year as well as those of its subcommittees.  The Committee had made extraordinary contributions since its establishment  and was serving as a unique platform for international cooperation.  It was working to develop a common platform for the use of space tools in furtherance of the sustainable development agenda  he said  adding that the post-2015 agenda required universally acceptable transformative tools to measure implementation of specified goals and targets. Concerted efforts were required to monitor the environment  he said  and underscored the imperative of enhancing cooperation on accessing and sharing space-derived data.  The Committee  during its session earlier this year  urged Member States to reinforce inter-governmental processes to share such data in the pursuit of national  regional  and global sustainable development efforts.  Regular mechanisms played a vital role in enhancing cooperation of space-faring States and others in the interest of common benefit  he said  highlighting recent efforts made in this direction.  The Committee had made constant endeavours to build capacity in the use of space tools  he said  calling for greater focus on ways of improving their use in the promotion of the sustainable development agenda. Statements NORACHIT SINHASENI (Thailand)  on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  was committed to working with the Outer Space Committee to promote the peaceful use of outer space.  ASEAN appreciated the discussions on space and sustainable development. Close cooperation at regional and international levels was indispensable to promote space technology; ASEAN encouraged developed countries to assist developing countries in order to fill the knowledge gap. Following the tsunamis of 2004  ASEAN recognized the utility of space-based data in improving early-warning systems and rescue operations. ASEAN reiterated its concern regarding the issue of space debris  which posed a communications risk. Speaking in his national capacity  he noted that Thailand  a member of the Outer Space Committee  was committed to promoting the peaceful uses of outer space in order to better people’s lives. Thailand commended the European Union’s initiative during the open-ended consultations on the international code of conduct for outer space activities; he underlined  however  the need to maintain an inclusive and transparent approach to finalize the consultation. In closing  he reaffirmed the commitment by ASEAN to the peaceful uses of outer space  stressing that space use must respect the principles of sovereignty  territorial integrity  and equal access for all States. He emphasized the need to prevent an arms race in the outer space. In order to ensure the sustainability and security of the space environment  he supported the discussion to lay down legal principles for outer space activities. MATEO ESTREME (Argentina)  speaking on behalf of Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR)  attached great importance to the international cooperation and peaceful use of outer space.  MERCOSUR was satisfied with the activities done by the Outer Space Committee throughout 2013  acting as a guarantor of the peaceful use of outer space  and promoting international dialogue.  He expressed the importance of the sovereign right of every State to develop outer space for the benefits of human development.  With that  he noted the following points: access to outer space should be on an equal footing; the non-appropriation of outer space must be respected; the non-militarization of outer space; regional cooperation — in the case of the MERCOSUR region  that would require the continued process of cooperation and seminars in the Americas. He stressed the primary importance of preventing an arms race in outer space  as that would avert a serious threat to international peace and security.  His region was aware that the increasing use of outer space could have unforeseeable impacts  such as space debris  which must be managed as that could affect the sustainability of space.  MERCOSUR believed international and regional cooperation was extremely important  especially for developing countries  as that would allow them to benefit from the technological progress made over the last years in space.  One priority was to develop synergy and create awareness of space and technology activities to spur development.  The impact of natural disasters was a matter of great concern  and the increasing effort to improve knowledge of space-disaster prevention was a must.  MERCOSUR supported the peaceful development of outer space and a legal order for space  taking into account the specific needs of developing countries. IOANNIS VRAILAS  representative of the European Union Delegation  said that the Union had developed unique space capabilities  which made it a world-class leader in space.  It had co-funded a state-of-the-art global satellite navigation system  Galileo  which guaranteed global positioning service under civilian control.  It had also backed the ambitious Copernicus satellite programme  which he said had gotten off to “a flying start”.  Stressing the increasing importance of satellite navigation technologies  he gauged that 6 to 7 per cent of the European Union’s gross domestic product (GDP) relied on positioning  navigation or timing services provided by the European Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS); that had resulted in new business opportunities in a wide variety of sectors  regionally and worldwide. He underscored the European Union’s commitment to developing an international code of conduct for outer space activities  and said that his region had offered all Member States the opportunity to share their views.  Following three rounds of consultations  the Union had prepared revised versions of the code  which was in near-final form.  Towards that end  he called on all States to join the Union in concluding that multilateral process  as a code of conduct would make an “indispensable contribution to enhancing the safety  security and sustainability of outer space activities”. ISRAEL NITZAN (Israel) said that the significant developments in space research and exploration in the past decade provided opportunities for global cooperation  from which every nation could benefit.  The past two decades had witnessed a dramatic intensification of space-related activities.  Eleven countries  including Israel  had space-launch capability  and more than 60 countries owned and operated approximately 1 200 active satellites.  Such assets offered a wide spectrum of civilian  commercial  and humanitarian-related services  many of them essential.  For that reason  Israel had signed cooperative agreements with sister space agencies from various countries.  Committed to international cooperation  his country had recently acceded to the United Nations Platform for Space-based Information for Disaster management and Emergency Response. He noted that Israel’s public and private sectors were striving for innovation and technological excellence in space research.  One of its five main objectives was to position the State among the five leading space-faring nations.  Israel’s strategic vision was to reach that objective through international cooperation; it invested almost 50 per cent of the National Civil Space Program’s budget in global partnerships.  Additionally  Israel was working closely with its partners in the United States and Europe in the fields of Earth and environmental monitoring and soil mapping.  Other areas of work included supernova detection and tracking  light-weight satellites and satellite formation flying  as well as micro-electrical propulsion systems and nano- and micro-satellites. MÓNICA BOLAÑOS PÉREZ (Guatemala) said the work done by the Committee and Subcommittee was of particular importance for developing countries.  In that regard  the increase of international and regional cooperation must be strengthened.  Because of the unique opportunity to increase the role of space and technology  Guatemala attached great importance to agreement on common goals for the development of outer space and its future activities.  Strengthening the legal framework and developing international space law to prevent its militarization was another priority.  She recalled that sustainability of space activities could only be done by reducing space debris and limiting their proliferation.  Outer space development must be made available to all States  and its use must be guided by international law.  The rapid increase in space activities required synergies to promote understanding by all.  She added that applying international law could minimize dispute on space activities; only discussions would ensure that all activities were for the benefit of all countries  and guarantee the peaceful activities of outer of space. RAIMUNDO GONZALEZ (Chile)  associating with MERCOSUR  drew the Committee’s attention to a “Gordian knot” in terms of space legislation.  Five treaties had been adopted as well as fundamental principles to guide the peaceful use of outer space.  While there was a constant reiteration of the existence of treaties  he said  some of those were the product of the cold-war era; they were biased and had not kept up with new dynamics in technology.  At the advent of the space era  there was traditional cooperation determined by the paradigm of international security.  Over time  as the geopolitical map changed  access to strategic knowledge on space technology needed to be promoted in the interest of collective benefit.  There also was need to build capacity to consume the abundance of information  he said  stressing the imperative of developing a conceptual framework on the global commons.RICARDO ALDAY GONZÁLEZ (Mexico) renewed his country’s appeal for international and regional cooperation for the peaceful development of outer space.  The Outer Space Committee and subcommittee enhanced throughout the world the role of space instruments and their development.  In the framework of space debris  Mexico welcomed efforts by Canada  Germany  and the Czech Republic  to address the effects and measure of space debris with the aim of reducing it. Mexico urged participating States to formalize proposals relating to the development of an international convention for outer space.  He responded positively to the European foreign action service participating in three consultations  to prepare a code of conduct on space activities  security  and sustainability  as well as confidence-building measures.  The code of conduct should be in line with international law.  The current proposal was not a binding instrument  and it should not include militarization  right of self-defence  or the destruction of space objects.  In his view  that instrument should be the result of a multilateral process.  Those countries that had not ratified the Outer Space Treaty should consider doing so.  The international symposium on space technology would take place next week  and he hoped it would strengthen international and regional efforts. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-15,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gal3481.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The scope and application of universal jurisdiction must be clearly defined to avoid abuse of the principle  which could endanger international law  order and security  speakers told the Sixth Committee (Legal) today. Many delegations called for a way to find consensus on the subject  pointing out that the topic had appeared on the General Assembly’s agenda due to abuse and politicization of the principle  particularly with regard to the African continent. Burkina Faso’s delegate said that  over the years  universal jurisdiction had become an effective way to combat impunity internationally  and ensure protection of humanity’s common values.  The principle waived the habitual rules of classical international law and appealed to the criminal justice of States. However  Rwanda’s representative said that while her country supported the appropriate use of the principle in good faith  it rejected its abuse and misuse of indictments by European judges against African leaders  subjecting them to the jurisdiction of European States.  That was contrary to the sovereign equality and independence of States  and evoked memories of colonialism. Indeed  Sudan’s representative said that the immunity of Heads of State was not open to question under international law  a stance which the African Union repeatedly reaffirmed in the context of the principle being politicized. The representative of Democratic Republic of the Congo  however  cautioned that in seeking consensus on its scope and application  “immunity must not be confused with impunity”.  Customary law showed that countries claimed immunity for Heads of State under the independence of States  which they represented.  Thus  immunity enjoyed by Heads of State resulted from the system of State immunities rather than diplomatic immunities. Singapore’s representative  noting the divergence of views and the sensitivity and complexity of defining the scope and application of the principle  favoured a step-by-step approach  starting with identification of key areas where there was likely to be general consensus.  That stance was supported by the representative of Brazil  who urged that an acceptable definition of the principle be found  and the crimes to which it was applicable be determined. Norway’s delegate  however  felt that the scope of universal jurisdiction was constantly evolving.  Rather than trying to reach consensus on a list of crimes to which it could be applied  discussions should focus on the procedural aspects of the application  with how prosecutors should act independently of political and other external influences. The representative of Poland said that only general and unified practice could create a basis for widespread recognition of universal jurisdiction as a generally binding rule of customary international law.  That would create a powerful tool for the international community to use in combatting the most serious crimes threatening humanity. Also speaking today on the topic of universal jurisdiction were representatives of Iran (also speaking for the Non-Aligned Movement)  Australia (also speaking for Canada and New Zealand)  South Africa (speaking for the African Group)  Trinidad and Tobago (speaking for Caribbean Community (CARICOM))  Costa Rica (speaking for the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC))  Guatemala  Russian Federation  Cuba  Algeria  Israel  Democratic Republic of the Congo  Colombia  Peru  El Salvador  Malaysia  Senegal  Qatar  Switzerland  United States  Thailand  Sri Lanka  China  United Republic of Tanzania  Nigeria  Azerbaijan  Mozambique  India  Belarus  Morocco  Ethiopia  Egypt  Lebanon  Jordan  Viet Nam  Tunisia and Kenya.  A representative of International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also spoke. Also speaking on the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) was a representative of Kuwait  having requested to reopen that agenda item. The Sixth Committee will next meet at 10 a.m. on Friday  17 October  to take up the Programme of Assistance in the Teaching  Study  Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law. Background The Sixth (Legal) Committee met today to take up consideration of the Secretary-General’s report on The scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction (document A/69/174). Statements HOSSEIN GHARIBI (Iran)  speaking for the Non-Aligned Movement  said the sovereign equality of States and non-interference in the eternal affairs of States should be respected in applying the principle of universal jurisdiction.  In that regard  the immunity of high-ranking officials should be respected.  Not to do so violated the sovereignty of States. Reminding the Committee that the item had been introduced to its agenda due to the abuse of the principle  in some cases by national courts against officials of other sovereign nations  he said those concerns should be addressed.  In addition  there were questions as to the range of crimes falling under universal jurisdiction and conditions for its application.  Further clarification from decisions and judgments of the International Court of Justice and the work of the International law Commission might be useful to that discussion. JULIA O’BRIEN (Australia)  speaking also on behalf of Canada and New Zealand  said their domestic legislation had established universal jurisdiction in their domestic courts over the most serious international crimes.  She acknowledged those States that had provided for universal jurisdiction in their domestic law  and encouraged those States who had not already done so to do so for that category of crimes.  Establishing such jurisdiction sent a unified and unequivocal message to perpetrators  and would-be perpetrators  that grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights law would not be tolerated. She also encouraged States to cooperate and  consistent with their international obligations and national practice  provide all means of support to each other  including mutual legal assistance to ensure the expedient and effective investigation and prosecution of individuals responsible for grave crimes.  Universal jurisdiction  when applied appropriately  was an important tool in the international community’s justice toolbox. KINGSLEY MAMABOLO (South Africa)  speaking for the African Group  said that abuse in the resort to universal jurisdiction  particularly over African officials  had caused the African Group to request the matter be included in the agenda of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly.  In addition  the African Union  in recognition of the principle’s purpose of ensuring that individuals who committed grave offences did not enjoy impunity  provided  in its Constitutive Act  for the right of the Union to intervene  at the request of any member State  in situations of genocide  war crimes and crimes against humanity. However  he stressed the importance of respecting other international norms in its application  including the sovereign equality of States  the territorial jurisdiction  and the immunity of officials existing under customary international law.  Furthermore  the International Court of Justice was of the view that the cardinal principle of immunity of Heads of States should not be questioned.  He called on the international community to adopt measures to put an end to the abuse and political manipulation of the principle by judges and politicians from States outside Africa  and that warrants of arrest issued on the basis of such abuse should not be executed by any State.  The Union had urged its members to use the principle of reciprocity to defend themselves against the abuse of universal jurisdiction. EDEN CHARLES (Trinidad and Tobago)  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  and associating himself with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) and the Non-Aligned Movement  expressed support for the General Assembly decision to establish a working group within the Sixth Committee  to continue a thorough discussion of the scope and application of universal jurisdiction.  He also expressed support for the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court  noting that a central element of the Rome Statute was the fundamental principle that no one was immune under international law for crimes such as genocide  crimes against humanity  war crimes  and the crime of aggression. Stressing that the Court’s jurisdiction was complementary to national criminal jurisdictions  he said that such authority was invited only when a State was unwilling or unable to prosecute criminals under its domestic law.  In exercising universal jurisdiction  the circumstances under which such applications would be appropriate must be clearly defined.  Universal jurisdiction was necessary and justifiable in instances where the crimes committed affected the international community  and national justice systems allowed the perpetrator to continue GEORGINA GUILLÉN-GRILLO (Costa Rica)  speaking for CELAC  said that universal jurisdiction was an institution of international law of exceptional character for the exercise of criminal jurisdiction.  It served to fight impunity and strengthen justice. However  the principle should not be confused with the exercise of international criminal jurisdiction  or with the obligation to extradite or prosecute.  Those institutions were of different legal natures  notwithstanding their complementarity for the purposes of fighting impunity.  While she could not predict the outcome of the Working Group on the matter  she mentioned the possibility of a future request to the International Law Commission to study the topic. ANA CRISTINA RODRÍGUEZ PINEDA (Guatemala)  associating herself with the Non-Aligned Movement and CELAC  said that since 1998 the International Criminal Court had been entrusted with administering international penal justice on an ongoing basis  leading one to ask where universal jurisdiction now fit in.  Although the Court did not exercise universal jurisdiction  the principle did carry out an important function by filling in gaps.  Its application therefore was relevant in cases when the Court’s jurisdiction could not be called.  It was important to gather information on the practice of Member States and the principle’s various aspects.  After consideration of the issue for five years  it was time to refer it to the International Law Commission.  Her country was part of a group that had submitted a proposal urging the Commission to study the principle’s status within international law.  That proposal would allow the Committee a solid and focused legal basis for consideration  given the insufficiency of feedback received from States  and enable a drafting of clear legal guidelines; avoid duplication of work carried out by other fora in the Organization; and facilitate the adoption of a technical approach.  While the principle did have political ramifications  those should not dominate the legal arguments of delegations. IDREES SAEED (Sudan)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said that further careful and objective study was needed of the principle.  Discussion of the matter must take into account the principles of equality of sovereignty and non-intervention of internal affairs of States  and must focus on the scope of application.  Furthermore  priority must be given to national jurisdiction.  Pointing out that States applied universal jurisdiction differently  he expressed concern at the abuse of its application by some national courts  which rendered it a source of international conflict.  The immunity of Heads of State was not open to question under international law  a stance which the African Union repeatedly reaffirmed in the context of the principle being politicized.  He cautioned against rushing into a unilateral determination of the scope and jurisdiction of the principle  whose determination should be kept away from politicization  and should adhere to international law  international customary law and the Charter. MAXIM V. MUSIKHIN (Russian Federation)  noting the wide range of views on universal jurisdiction and its implementation  said its main constructs remained significantly eroded.  Before applying conditions of implementation and scope  Member States must exercise extreme caution  given that there had been sufficient examples of unilateral use of that principle  which had led to serious complications in inter-State discourse.  Implementation should be in line with norms of customary international law  in particular those dealing with the immunity of senior officials of States.  To combat impunity for the most serious crimes of international law  other not-so-contentious instruments could be used for the further strengthening of treaty and non-treaty mechanisms of cooperation in international law  such as legal assistance  extradition  exchange of information and cooperation among law enforcement.  While he did not object to further discussion  he pointed out that divergent views which had hampered progress on the topic had not gone away.  Moving ahead in discussion would be difficult  especially since the Committee could not realistically talk about prospects for implementation.  In principle  his delegation did not see the practical utility of formulating them. TANIERIS DIEGUEZ LAO (Cuba)  associating herself with the Non-Aligned Movement and CELAC  said that the primary objective of the General Assembly should be to define the principle’s proper application.  She expressed concern at its improper use by the tribunals of developed countries against developing countries  which had a negative effect on international relations.  It should be used only in exceptional circumstances as a “stop-gap” measure  and not be used selectively for political purposes in contravention of international law.  The Assembly should determine when and against what crimes the principle could be invoked  as well as ensure its compatibility with the Charter.  The principle should be restricted to crimes against humanity and invoked only when there were no other means to prosecute the perpetrators of those acts.  Furthermore  there must be approval from the country where the crimes were committed or where the perpetrator was a citizen.  Its application must only be supplementary to the jurisdiction of States.  Absolute immunity for Heads of State  diplomatic personnel and other high level civil servants in office should be beyond question. MOHAMED SALAH EDDINE BELAID (Algeria)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said his country was strongly concerned about the selective and arbitral applications of universal jurisdiction  particularly when applied without due regard to the requirements of international justice and equality.  Its misuse could only negatively impact national and international stability.  Selectivity  political motivation and abuse in the principle’s application against only African States by some jurisdictions  especially the International Criminal Court  were the main reasons for holding  in October 2013  an Extraordinary Summit of the African Union in Addis-Ababa.  As noted during that Summit  the activities of the Court throughout its eleven years of existence had focused exclusively on Africa  while unacceptable situations in other parts of the world had been  and still were being  ignored.  International justice must respect the sovereignty and independence of States  including the African countries. AMIT HEUMANN (Israel)  pointing out divergent views regarding the principle  noted that such stances were reflected in inconsistent definitions of the principle in the national legislation of States.  Moreover  there were divergent views on which crimes were subject to application of the principle in national legislation and domestic judicial practices  which  in some instances  included crimes that lacked the basic characteristics inherent to the concept.  There was a need to prevent the principle’s abuse by establishing appropriate safeguards in national legal systems  such as requiring that prosecutions based on universal jurisdiction be conducted publicly; approval from high-level officials be sought for its use; and that the accused be present  as well as additional jurisdictional links. MYRIAM AMAN SOULAMA (Burkina Faso) said the principle of universal jurisdiction over the years had become an effective way to combat impunity internationally  and ensure protection of humanity’s common values.  It waived the rules and habitual principles of classical international law and appealed to the criminal justice of States.  To be consensual in scope and implementation  universal jurisdiction should take up the most serious international crimes  such as genocide  war crimes  and crimes against humanity.  Its implementation should be based on a specific legal base.  Each State must domesticate it in order to implement it within its internal judicial system.  Differences of opinion on the scope and application should not stop the international community from using classical mechanisms  such as the principle of aut dedere aut judicare  a complementary principle that helped Member States deal with problems related to prosecution. PATRICK LUNA (Brazil)  associating himself with CELAC  said that the principle of sovereign equality was a reminder that the exercise of jurisdiction was a primary responsibility of the State concerned.  On the other hand  ending impunity relating to the most serious crimes was an obligation contained in numerous relevant treaties  and was crucial to ensure a rule-based international system.  Thus  universal jurisdiction should only be exercised in full respect to international law  and subsidiary to domestic legal systems.  It needed to be limited to specific crimes and not be used arbitrarily towards political ends.  An acceptable definition of the principle must be found  and the crimes to which it was applicable determined.  Noting that the application of universal jurisdiction and the principle of justice while upholding jurisdictional immunities of State officials was a contentious issue  he said it was premature to adopt uniform standards at the international level.  Brazil’s legal framework required enactment of national legislation to enable the exercise of universal jurisdiction. NTUMBA DA SILVA (Democratic Republic of the Congo)  associating herself with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  said the Working Group should define clear rules to regulate the implementation of universal jurisdiction.  As the principle allowed States to use their jurisdiction regardless of any connection with a situation  it was enough for the accused to be present in a State  in order for that State to judge.  If the international community was truly motivated to achieve an equitable solution  it should exercise objectivity.  She asked what could be done to achieve better acceptance of universal jurisdiction.  In general terms  some uniformity was needed  as well as harmonization of some terms and concepts. MIGUEL CAMILO RUIZ BLANCO (Colombia)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and CELAC  said that the international legal system recognized five bases for penal jurisdiction  of which universal jurisdiction was the last  clearly making it of a residual nature.  The thrust of the concept was the legislative authority of a State to extend its prescriptive jurisdiction when there was no territorial or national linkage.  Universal jurisdiction was merely a prescriptive jurisdiction recognized by international law  giving all States the power to investigate and prosecute crimes such as genocide and crimes against humanity  even when the crimes had not been committed on their territory.  However  its exercise must be in line with international law and its exercise had the same limitations as any other jurisdiction  requiring a respect for the principles of any other jurisdiction.  The Colombian legal system recognized universal jurisdiction as an exception.  It was limited to penal jurisdiction and applicable only to serious crimes against international humanitarian law. GUSTAVO MEZA-CUADRA (Peru)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and CELAC  underscored that there was no uniform criterion on the crimes to which universal jurisdiction should apply  and the sources that regulated its use.   The experience of one Member State in cases of piracy on the high seas had shown that universal jurisdiction had traditionally been accepted through international customary law  and subsequently clarified through conventional norms. It seemed useful to assess the application of the principle to other crimes comparable to piracy  and which occurred outside the jurisdiction of coastal States.  While the Committee was the appropriate forum for dealing with the principle’s scope and application  in order to move forward on the issue  the Committee should consider the possibility of the International Law Commission studying the issue as well. RUBÉN ZAMORA (El Salvador) said misunderstandings between universal jurisdiction and other similar concepts  such as aut dedere aut judicare  must be overcome.  Universal jurisdiction exclusively concerned the nature of the crime and damage caused.  States could not make indiscriminate use of its punitive powers since the State where the crime was committed had primary responsibility for its prosecution  and could best investigate.  Therefore  it should only be used in exceptional circumstances.  In his country’s domestic legislation  universal jurisdiction provided for the application of penal law to crimes committed outside its jurisdiction when they contravened international covenants or were crimes against human rights.  Therefore  the principle was not of use only for specifically named crimes. NURASHIKIN ISMAIL (Malaysia)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said clear criteria defining the principle must be agreed upon before the matter progressed further.  He voiced concern over the lack of discussion on the principle’s goal  noting that a uniform view was imperative in avoiding different standards in application.  Without proper understanding and legal safeguards  universal jurisdiction could encroach into States’ sovereignty.  Any exercise of extra-territorial criminal jurisdiction must be based on enabling domestic law  he said  citing implementation challenges  including in the acquisition of evidence from States  which could impede prosecution in national courts.  For prosecuting crimes committed elsewhere  States must have in place effective mutual legal assistance in criminal matters and extradition regimes. ZDZISLAW GALICKI (Poland) welcomed continued consideration of the principle  even though he accepted the decision of the International Law Commission to conclude the topic aut dedere aut judicare  at least temporarily.  As he stated last year  on a national level the principle of territorial jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction was applied  although in limited cases it also applied universal jurisdiction.  He welcomed sharing of such practices by States and international organizations  affirming that the Committee was correct to focus on how States applied the principle.  Only general and unified practice could create a basis for general recognition of universal jurisdiction as a generally binding rule of customary international law.  That  in turn  would create a powerful tool for the international community to use in combatting the most serious crimes threatening humanity. IBRAHIMA SORY SYLLA (Senegal)  associating himself with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that the constant evolution of doctrine on international jurisdiction had shown that the immunity of senior officials of a State before foreign criminal courts was based  not on international courtesy  but on the bedrock of international law.  Agreement must be reached on a definition of crimes that would fall under universal jurisdiction  and on the conditions of its application  to ensure its non-selective implementation.  The international community must agree on a system of international prosecution applicable to all perpetrators of serious crimes  regardless of their nationality.  The case with respect to Chad’s former President  Hissene Habre  was illustrative in that area.  After a long judicial procedure  the African Union ultimately said Senegal was to judge Mr. Habre on behalf of Africa.  Therefore  his country had amended its criminal legislation in 2007 to allow its national courts to become aware of international crimes committed outside Senegalese territory.  The Chambres Africaines Extraordinaires had created and placed in Senegalese jurisdiction the capacity to judge Mr. Habre for crimes committed in Chad from 7 June 1982 until 1 December 1990.  That judicial procedure had demonstrated that Africa herself could be at the avant garde in the fight against impunity. MARIA BERGRAM AAS (Norway) said that although universal jurisdiction had gained solid standing as a principle of international criminal law  previous deliberations had revealed differing views on which crimes the principle should apply to.  As the scope of universal jurisdiction was constantly evolving  she cautioned against attempts to reach a consensus on a list of crimes to which it could be applied.  Instead  discussions should focus on the procedural aspects of the application with how prosecutors should act independently of political and other external influences at the forefront of the debate.  It would be relevant to consider how prosecutorial discretion applied to cases based on universal jurisdiction  including how and to whom the competency to decide on universal jurisdiction was bestowed within States.  Other elements were whether prosecutorial decisions were made on a collegial basis or not  and to what extent a decision to prosecute cases based on universal jurisdiction could be appealed. LUKE TANG (Singapore)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that universal jurisdiction served mainly to complement other bases of jurisdiction  primarily those of territoriality and nationality.  Noting the divergence of views and the sensitivity and complexity of the issue  he favoured a step-by-step approach  starting with identification of key areas where there was likely to be general consensus.  He highlighted three concepts of applicability: only to those crimes agreed upon by the international community; never as the primary basis for the exercise of criminal jurisdiction  but only in instances when no State was able or willing to exercise the primary basis of jurisdiction; and never in isolation  but only with other principles of international law.  Thus  the primary jurisdiction to enforce would remain the prerogative of the State  having jurisdiction based on territoriality or nationality. MAKIZA MAURICE GATIEN (Congo)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said that the international community should clearly define universal jurisdiction and determine a list of crimes that would be subject to its application  which in addition to crimes of genocide  war and those against humanity  could also include gross violations of human rights and economic crimes  among others.  Conditions authorizing courts to apply universal jurisdiction must be agreed upon by all States.  While prosecution of serious crimes was principally the sphere of national courts  the International Criminal Court could stand in when that was not possible.  He called for assistance for national capacity-building in that regard.  In seeking consensus on the scope and application  he said  “immunity must not be confused with impunity”.  No authority should sidestep justice by hiding behind immunities.  Customary law showed that countries claimed immunity for Heads of State under the independence of States  which they represented.  Thus  immunity enjoyed by Heads of State resulted from the system of State immunities rather than diplomatic immunities. Mr. AL-SULAITI (Qatar) expressed hope that  given the diverse opinions on the principle’s scope and application  the Working Group would finish identifying points of consensus and those that required further consultation.  Balance between the progressive development of universal jurisdiction and respect for the principles of the Charter should be observed.  The nature of the crime should determine whether it fell within the scope of universal jurisdiction; crimes of humanity and gross human rights violations should be among those to which universal jurisdiction applied.  Gross violations of human rights required the assistance of legal mechanisms in order to deter further commission of such crimes.  Otherwise  violations would increase day after day.  Stressing that perpetrators were now hiding behind the gaps in international covenants and international law  he said achieving a definition of universal jurisdiction  including its scope  was needed today more than ever. CHRISTINE ELISABETH LOEW (Switzerland) said that involvement of the International Law Commission was desirable because of the fundamentally juridical nature and technical character of the subject in question  which should be examined at greater depth  primarily by legal specialists.  The Commission would not only be able to examine the status of universal jurisdiction with regard to international law as a whole  but also help the international community answer more specific legal questions on the basis of an analytic study.  A review of that kind  dedicated to the exercise of universal jurisdiction in criminal procedures by national courts  would provide constructive information to discussions.  Universal jurisdiction helped ensure that those guilty of the most serious crimes were brought to justice in cases where no other jurisdiction could apply. LESLIE KIERNAN (United States) said that basic questions remained about how jurisdiction should be exercised in relation to universal crimes and States’ practices.  The submissions by States  the Working Group’s efforts and the Secretary-General’s reports were extremely useful in identifying differences of opinion and points of consensus among States.  It would be useful for the Committee to understand whether alternative bases of jurisdiction were relied upon at the same time; how States address competing jurisdictional claims by other States that could have a closer nexus to the underlying criminal act; and if they did so  how national courts had addressed due process challenges.  In some States  prosecution based on universal jurisdiction required the authorization by the Government or a Government-designated person.  She said she wished to learn what other conditions or safeguards States had instituted with the use of universal jurisdiction  noting that appropriate safeguards should be in place to ensure its responsible use. KRAIJAKR THIRATAYAKINANT (Thailand)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  underscored that perpetrators of serious crimes who do not fall within universal jurisdiction must  nevertheless  be brought to justice.  At the very least  they should be prosecuted by the State on whose territory the crimes were committed or whose nationals were victims of such crimes.  While bringing perpetrators of grave crimes to justice was very important  the application of universal jurisdiction in such cases should be founded on a sound legal basis  and not be politically motivated.  The legitimacy and credibility of those principles depended upon its consistent application with other principles and rules of international law. PALITHA T. B. KOHONA (Sri Lanka) said from the principle’s beginnings  primarily as a means for maritime States to assert jurisdiction over piracy  there had been a gradual expansion of its content to encompass other egregious acts such as war crimes  genocide and torture.  The expansion had unavoidable implications for a range of other concepts  such as sovereign equality of States  the immunity of State officials for official acts  and when and who was entitled to exercise such jurisdiction.  Those issues were still being debated.  Some have suggested that the principle had become a political tool clothed in a legal veneer to advance political interests  and that expansion could infringe on diplomatic privileges and immunities.  Therefore  more clarification was needed.  Universal jurisdiction should not be exercised by another country while judicial mechanisms were already in process in the country where the offense occurred.  A clear delineation of both the scope and application of the principle was needed.  A consensus-based framework would only serve to strengthen and reinforce its legitimacy. XIANG XIN (China) said universal jurisdiction was supplementary in nature.  Exercise of it must abide by existing principles and rules of international law.  The suggestion by certain States that that exercise of the principle must meet certain specific conditions  such as the suspect being within the territory of the exercising State  and non-violation of the obligations of “extradition or prosecution”  required the Committee’s serious study.  He noted that  except for a limited number of serious crimes such as piracy on the high-seas  there was no coherence in the positions and practices of States with regard to crimes to which universal jurisdiction was applicable.  In those circumstances  the principle should be exercised cautiously in order to prevent abuse of it. TULLY MWAIPOPO (United Republic of Tanzania)  associating herself with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  pointed to the divergent views on the conditions for the exercise of universal jurisdiction  both in principle and in practice.  Therefore  States must find common ground on how to implement it as an international legal principle  capable of uniformly guiding their national courts in prosecuting perpetrators.  It might be fitting to have input from the International Law Commission.  Ultimately  Member States’ agreement on the way forward must remain the linchpin on which the eventual conclusion of the matter would be based.  States must agree on a definition of universal jurisdiction and distinguish it from other concepts  such as international criminal jurisdiction  the obligation to “extradite or prosecute”  as well as other related principles and rules of international law. USMAN SARKI (Nigeria)  associating himself with the African Group  stressed the need for a definition of universal jurisdiction to ensure its unbiased application and to resist its selective application  especially for political purposes.  It was an important tenet of international law that ensured perpetrators of the most heinous crimes were held accountable.  Although views of the topic were diverse  the principle was crucial in the fight against impunity  and should always be exercised in good faith and in accordance with other principles  including  among others  the immunity of officials in exercise of their duties.  Universal jurisdiction should only apply where a State was unable or unwilling to prosecute.  His Government worked to ensure that the principle was used impartially by the International Criminal Court.  Further  the principle should only be used as a last resort and must not be used recklessly by stronger States against weaker States  especially where there was the possibility for national jurisdiction to prevail.  In addition  the International Law Commission could be consulted on the matter  due to the principle’s technical nature. ROVSHAN ISRAFILOV (Azerbaijan)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that although a number of international treaties provided for universal jurisdiction regarding various offences  States’ practice was largely limited to such international offences as war crimes  crimes against humanity and crimes against peace.  Primary responsibility for investigating and prosecuting serious international crimes lay with the State of territorial jurisdiction.  Universal jurisdiction provided a complementary mechanism only when that State was unable or unwilling to exercise jurisdiction.  He highlighted the importance of the principle in situations of armed conflict  including those of protracted nature or involving prolonged foreign military occupation.  Indeed  past wrongs left unpunished impeded progress towards peace and reconciliation  and could even lead to new conflicts and the commission of new crimes.  A thorough legal study of the issue was needed. ANTONIO GUMENDE (Mozambique)  associating himself with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  said the application of universal jurisdiction was of great concern to all Member States  and to African States in particular  since African leaders had been the major target of some individual European judges.  The unilateral prosecution of some African leaders by some courts was a clear violation of norms of international law  and had generated “international concerns” over its legal and political consequences.  He reiterated the call for a cautious consideration of the political and legal implications of that issue.  Any attempt to unilaterally apply the principle was inappropriate  as it would compromise and disrupt the existing international legal system.  His country had been advocating the need for the regulation of the principle’s application at the international level.  Such regulation should establish the criteria for the principle’s application and for its compatibility with relevant international law instruments  as well as with the Charter.  Also  the international community needed to identify the crimes that would be subjected to universal jurisdiction  and in which circumstances they could be invoked. KOTESWARA RAO (India)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  said the question that arose was whether the jurisdiction  as provided for specific serious international crimes under certain treaties  could be converted into a commonly exercisable jurisdiction  irrespective of whether or not the other State or States were a party to those treaties.  Several issues remained unanswered  including those related to the basis of extending such jurisdiction; the relationship with the law relating to immunity; pardoning and amnesty; and harmonization with the domestic laws.  Several treaties obliged States parties either to try a criminal or handover for trial to a party willing to do so.  That was the obligation of aut dedere aut judicare  a widely recognized principle  including by the International Court of Justice in the Belgium vs. Senegal case  and should not be confused with or short circuited by universal jurisdiction. ILYA ADAMOV (Belarus)  associating his delegation with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that while universal jurisdiction issues were legal in nature  it was necessary to consider the political aspects.  In that regard  a cautious  restrained approach was needed when considering the expansion of the principle’s scope.  Universal jurisdiction in the true sense of the term could only be based on norms of international law  be they treaty based or customary law-based  such as in the case of piracy.  Criteria for applying it were also quite clear and unambiguous in nature.  In that regard  he proposed that universal jurisdiction be applied to crimes against peace  war crimes  crimes against humanity  piracy  human trafficking  and transnational organized crime  such as drug— and arms—trafficking.  A unilateral expansion of the principle’s application could not be seen as other than extraterritorial  which contravened the principle of the sovereign equality of States.  He welcomed the recent decision of the International Court of Justice with respect to clarifying the aspects of scope and principle.  Those decisions applied to concrete situations  and to base wide reaching conclusions on them would be short-sighted. Mr. LAARSI (Morocco) said that the principle derogated from international criminal law.  Under the principle  any State that had subscribed to it under a treaty or convention could assert extraterritorial jurisdiction with regard to the most heinous crimes.  On a national platform  articles 704-708 of Morocco’s criminal procedure code  currently in preparation  dealt with crimes outside its territory.  The Moroccan legal system was based on territorial or personal jurisdiction.  However  there was also nothing that would preclude universal jurisdiction in its legal framework.  Pointing out that it was optional  rather than a binding rule  he said it was a preventive measure that could fill gaps in national legal frameworks.  Morocco had acceded to the four Geneva Conventions  and had withdrawn its reservation against article 20 of the Convention against Torture.  Indeed  the criminalization of certain acts of torture or cruel treatment had been enshrined in the Moroccan Constitution.  Its legal framework also set out the primacy of international conventions over national law. JEANNE D’ARC BYAJE (Rwanda)  associating herself with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  commended Member States that had extradited or prosecuted people who participated in the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi.  However  she expressed regret that a number of genocide fugitives were still enjoying safe haven in Member States  including nine key genocide fugitives indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  While her country supported the appropriate use of the principle of universal jurisdiction in good faith  it rejected the abuse and misuse of indictments by non-African judges against African leaders.  Indictments issued by European judges against officials of African States had the effect of subjecting the latter to the jurisdiction of European States  contrary to the sovereign equality and independence of States  which evoked memories of colonialism for African States.  Noting that the abuse of universal jurisdiction could endanger international law  order and security  she cautioned that it could also set a bad precedent if all countries that were victims of abusive international warrants resorted to the principle of reciprocity in order to defend themselves.  She expressed support for the request made by African leaders that warrants of arrest  which were issued on the basis of the abuse of universal jurisdiction  be withdrawn. YIDNEKACHEW GEBRE-MESKEL ZEWDU (Ethiopia)  associating himself with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  said the issues surrounding universal jurisdiction were becoming extremely critical to African countries.  On abuse of the principle  he said Heads of State and Governments of member States of the African Union were concerned about the prosecutions instituted and the arrest warrants issued by certain foreign courts against sitting African leaders or other high ranking officials  in violation of the immunity granted to them under international law.  Universal jurisdiction must be exercised in tandem with recognized rules of international law.  It should be invoked only as a complementary jurisdiction for serious crimes based on their effect on humanity  and take into account the immunities granted to foreign state officials in exercise of their representative functions. AMR ELHAMAMY (Egypt)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said it was unfortunate that State practice reflected the abuse of the principle of universal jurisdiction by some politicians and legislators of non-African States  tailoring its application to indict some  while acquitting others.  That manipulation did not serve justice  but rather affected the credibility of international law and the fight against impunity.  In order to prevent abuse of the principle  agreement must be reached on specific safeguards and conditions for the assertion of universal jurisdiction.  It should be exercised in good faith and with due regard to other principles of international law.  As well  application of it required the consent of a Governmental authority  such as an Attorney General  and the presence of the accused person in the territory where proceedings were taking place. YOUSSEF HITTI (Lebanon) said that as for the jurisdiction ratione materiae  the international community first had to agree on a list of grave crimes falling under the concept of universal jurisdiction.  There had been a growing convergence emanating from the international community regarding piracy  torture  crimes against humanity  genocide  war crimes and ethnic cleaning as constituting the most serious crimes under international law.  Their definitions  however  may vary from one State to another  possibly leading to inconsistent applications.  Those concerns could be addressed through the establishment of an international convention that would identify and define those crimes.  The primary responsibility to prosecute lay with concerned States.  Universal jurisdiction must then apply when States were unwilling or unable to fairly and credibly prosecute the alleged perpetrators before a national court.  The principle of complementarity would safeguard sovereignty and non-intervention  as well as the principle of ne bis in idem  under which a perpetrator could not be prosecuted before different courts for the same crime.  It was high time for the International Law Commission to prepare a study on the scope and application of universal jurisdiction  in order to streamline and reconcile the diverging positions among States. ALI ABSOUL (Jordan)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  reiterated the importance of reaching an agreement on the principle’s scope and application.  He said that due to lack of consensus  it would be appropriate to request a review of the principle’s scope  the study of which would look at the sources of customary international law.  In that regard  it would be useful to refer the matter to the International Court of Justice  as doing so would limit any political involvement on the issue. PHAM THI HUONG (Vietnam)  associating herself with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that universal jurisdiction should be limited to the most serious crimes of international concern  including genocide  crimes against humanity  and war crimes  and emphasized that it should be applied in good faith and within a well-founded legal framework.  It should be considered a last resort and complementary to other jurisdictions with a stronger link to crimes  such as territorial or national jurisdiction.  In cases where the State was able to prosecute such crimes  universal jurisdiction should not be applied.  In addition  a State could only exercise universal jurisdiction when the alleged perpetrator was present on its territory.  She expressed support for clarification and the development of international standards or guidelines that clearly set out the crimes subject to universal jurisdiction and the conditions under which it could be applied. NOUR ZARROUK (Tunisia) said universal jurisdiction must be applied strictly within the Charter’s framework and international law.  It must be exceptional in nature and applied without abuse or selectivity.  Thus  there must be a clear and consensus-based decision in determining the principle’s scope and application.  The complexity of the principle had given rise to different views among Member States.  The Committee must have more in-depth discussions on various aspects within the Working Group.  The principle was a useful complement  although clearly distinct  from international criminal tribunals.  Twelve years after being established  the International Criminal Court had proved successful in promoting peace and international justice  and today enjoyed international respect.  However  that Court only dealt with crimes after they had been committed.  For that reason  her country had proposed the creation of an international constitutional court to be tasked with guaranteeing respect for democratic principles and human rights.  The creation of that constitutional court would have the prerogative of ruling on irregular elections  and would provide advice in drafting national constitutions. HOSSEIN GHARIBI (Iran)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that his country viewed universal jurisdiction as a treaty-based exception in exercising criminal jurisdiction.  The prevailing principle  however  was territorial jurisdiction  which was key to the sovereign equality of States.  There was no specific legislation concerning universal jurisdiction in Iran’s legal system; as well  there did not seem to be precedent in applying it in practice.  Iranian courts were entitled to jurisdiction over certain crimes irrespective of where they took place or the nationality of the accused  given the presence of the alleged offender on Iranian territory.  He stressed that “extradite or prosecute” provisions of treaties or bilateral agreements were not equivalent to universal jurisdiction.  Furthermore  the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over foreign nationals should be unbiased  and in good faith. It should also not be arbitrarily applied  and should respect the immunity granted under international law to incumbent high-ranking Government officials.  He warned that leaving interpretation of international crimes to national courts would have adverse effects on the integrity of international law. JAMES NDIRAGU WAWERU (Kenya)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said the concept of universal jurisdiction should be distinguished from the work of the International Criminal Court  which was complementary to national criminal jurisdiction.  However  that Court  in relation to Kenya  interpreted the Rome Statute consistent with a political agenda  which had put the country into a constitutional crisis and had led the President to appoint an acting President in his stead so that he might personally appear  as required by the Court  at the status conferences concluded last week  despite his public duties and in contravention of the Rome Statute.  That was unacceptable  and no State should have to endure such circumstances.  The current debate on universal jurisdiction was also about the future management of cases of impunity and violence in the world  and the way in which States related to each other within the international justice system.  “We should restrain ourselves from adopting a narrow  rigid and agenda driven interpretation of the role of universal jurisdiction and should advocate for an all-inclusive and carefully calibrated system with clear benchmarks  transparency and achievable standards ” he said. KELLY GEOGHEGAN  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)  said universal jurisdiction played a vital role in enforcing international humanitarian law  and said she was pleased that many States had established some form of universal jurisdiction over serious violations of humanitarian laws in their national legal systems.  While recognizing States’ desire to better frame the application of universal jurisdiction  she said that the ICRC was convinced that the conditions for opening criminal proceedings  or justifying a refusal to open criminal proceedings  should be clearly defined at the national level.  Such conditions should strengthen the effectiveness and predictability of the principle’s use.  Given the technical  practical and financial challenges of implementing universal jurisdiction  it was essential that States keep enacting appropriate national legislation to prosecute war crimes  using both national and extraterritorial jurisdiction.  That would help deter war crimes and let perpetrators be prosecuted when violations occur. Statement on the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law ABDULAZIZ ALIBRAHEEM (Kuwait)  noting satisfaction with the finalization of the draft Transparency Convention  stressed the Commission’s role in the administration of justice at the national and international levels.  Indeed  UNCITRAL played an increasing role in the field of international trade arbitration.  Rule of law must be an integral part of trade relations.  A conducive environment to trade and investment  as well as for regulations  must be established  as those were important elements in conflict-prevention.  His country attached great importance to the development of electronic legislation which could help combat electronic crimes  which had accounted for hundreds of billions of dollars in losses.  His country promoted laws in that regard  and draft legislation had been submitted to its parliament. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-15,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaef3400.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The Secretary-General’s synthesis report would launch negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda  delegates in the Second Committee (Economics and Finance) heard today as it began its discussion of sustainable development. “The new agenda should build upon the foundation laid by the Millennium Development Goals and complete the unfinished business in a more sustainable manner ” said the representative of Malawi  who spoke on behalf of the African Group.  She added that poverty eradication had to remain the “central and overarching goal” and was a prerequisite to attaining sustainable development. Tackling the Committee’s most extensive agenda item  with a total of 24 reports under consideration  most delegations stressed their commitment to negotiating the post-2015 agenda.  To that end  Costa Rica’s delegate  who spoke on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  underlined the importance of the first meetings of the High Level Political Forum  and noted the Economic and Social Council’s role in achieving balanced integration of all three dimensions of sustainable development. The Forum had to be a platform for regular dialogue  with an action-oriented agenda  to ensure a focus on new and emerging challenges  he said  urging cooperation between the Forum and other relevant regional entities.  Alongside intergovernmental negotiations  regional groups  social movements and civil society also had to contribute to negotiations on the agenda. Thailand’s representative also called for coherence and synergy in the Forum and looked ahead to the Third International Conference on Financing for Development  which she said would be essential to ensuring a strong and reliable means of implementation  in science  technology and innovation  finance  capacity- building and trade. A third important process would converge with discussions on the new development agenda and the conference on financing for development.  Joining a chorus of States looking forward to the Paris Conference on Climate Change  were representatives of Bolivia (on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China)  Barbados (on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM))  and Nauru (on behalf of Alliance of Small Island States). Bolivia’s representative stressed the need for sustainable development to conform to the Rio Principles  while the representative of Barbados underscored the constant threats faced by small island developing States  and Nauru’s representative said the outcome of the process launched under the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action should be a new  legally-binding  universally applicable Protocol to the Convention  to be adopted before the end of 2015. “We cannot simply wait for a new agreement ” said Norway’s representative  underlining the urgent need for action  “We need action now while we negotiate”.  She called for a global shift to low-carbon development  and the representatives of Brazil and Malaysia detailed efforts their countries had made in that regard  with Malaysia’s delegate pointing to a 33 per cent reduction in the emissions intensity of its gross domestic product (GDP)  and her aim to increase the share of renewables in Malaysia’s energy mix to 10 per cent by 2020. Throughout the day  delegates affirmed similar commitments to combating climate change.  The representative of Japan described efforts made to support developing countries  which included $16 billion of support over a year and a half and the hosting of the Innovation for Cool Earth Forum to share collective wisdom on energy efficient technology innovations.  He also looked forward to the Third World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Japan as an opportunity to share lessons learned in that field. In a similar vein  Israel’s representative attached great importance to cooperating with partners to tackle the issue of desertification.  With 60 per cent of her country a desert  slowing the pace of desertification — which was exacerbated by unsustainable practices and climate change — was a high priority. Such cooperation was also discussed by the President of the General Assembly who addressed the Second Committee prior to the debate on sustainable development.  He underlined his ambition for a renewed and strengthened global partnership for development  backed by financial resources  technology transfer and capacity-building.  He also referred to negotiation of the post-2015 development agenda  making clear the need for it to contain the overarching objective of eradication of poverty.  The new agenda should be transformative  producing “tangible benefits and improved livelihoods for all ” he said. Also speaking were representatives of Egypt (on behalf of the Arab Group)  Bangladesh (on behalf of the Group of Least Developed Countries)  South Africa  Venezuela  Argentina  Mexico  India  Sri Lanka  China  Ethiopia  Belarus  Sudan  Canada  Qatar  Syria  Iraq  and Maldives.  A representative of the delegation of the European Union also gave a statement. Presenting reports for the Committee’s consideration were the Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs  Department of Economic and Social Affairs; Assistant Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction; Executive Secretary of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification; Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity; Director of the Division of Water Sciences  United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization; Director-General of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); Deputy Regional Director for Arab States  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); New York Liaison Officer of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD); a representative of the Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All; Senior Regional Advisor  UNDP; and a Programme Officer of the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The representative of Syria contributed to the question and answer session that followed introduction of the reports. The Second Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. tomorrow  16 October  to conclude its debate on sustainable development. Background The Second Committee (Economic and Financial) began its discussion of sustainable development this morning.  The Committee had before it several reports on sustainable development (documents A/69/76  A/69/257  A/69/309  A/69/313 and A/69/320). The Committee had before it several other reports  including:  “Implementation of Agenda 21  the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 and the outcomes of the World Summit on Sustainable Development and of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development” (documents A/68/970  A/69/79  A/69/312  A/69/315  A/69/326  A/69/379 and A/69/395); and “Follow-up to and implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States” (documents A/CONF.223/10  A/69/314 and A/69/319). The Committee also considered reports related to “International Strategy for Disaster Reduction” (document A/69/364); “Protection of global climate for present and future generations of humankind” (document A/69/317); “Implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification Particularly in Africa” (documents A/69/311 and A/69/317); “Convention on Biological Diversity” (A/69/317); “Report of the United Nations Environment Assembly of the United Nations Environment Programme” (document A/69/25); “Harmony with Nature” (document A/69/322); “Promotion of new and renewable sources of energy” (documents A/69/323 and A/69/395). Statement by President of General Assembly SAM K. KUTESA (Uganda)  President of the General Assembly  in his address to the Committee said that its work was of critical importance and uniquely placed in providing contributions on how to deal with economic  social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.  The world was at a critical juncture  and had to focus on finalizing the modalities for the Paris Climate Summit and for the intergovernmental negotiation on the post-2015 development agenda  so that the substantive negotiations could commence in January 2015.  He would be appointing co-facilitators and co-Chairs soon. He called for a transformative post-2015 development agenda that would produce tangible benefits and improved livelihoods for all.  It must promote integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development with the overarching objective of eradicating poverty at its core  as agreed upon in the Rio+20 Summit.  It should encompass goals which were global in nature and applicable to all countries  while taking into account countries’ national circumstances  particular situations and levels of development.  It was essential to give greater attention to the needs of countries in special situations  including Africa  least developed countries  landlocked developing countries and small island developing States  in addressing their development challenges. The post-2015 agenda must go hand-in-hand with high ambitions for a renewed and strengthened global partnership for development  he said.  Its success hinged on the mobilization of adequate means of implementation  including financial resources  technology transfer and capacity-building.  Fulfilling of all official development assistance (ODA) commitments remained critical for its implementation  but innovative financing mechanisms must also be explored.  The adverse effects of climate change  including rising sea levels  land degradation  desertification and changing weather patterns  were negatively impacting the lives of peoples across the globe.  There must be a resolute action  and the Conferences of the Parties in Lima and Paris would be decisive in the collective efforts to commit to a global climate agreement. Introductory Remarks THOMAS GASS  Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs  Department of Economic and Social Affairs  introduced the “Report of the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals” (document A/69/970)  saying the goals proposed encapsulated “a transformative agenda”.  The proposal was the “main basis for integrating sustainable development goals into the post-2015 development agenda”  according to the General Assembly.  The goals built on and advanced the core agenda of the Millennium Development Goals  while adopting a more universal approach.  They broke new ground in several areas; there were standalone goals on climate change  promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies and on revitalizing the global partnership for development.  Financing was addressed in depth in the “Report of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing” (document A/69/315).  It provided a range of resource mobilization options to support implementation of the post-2015 development agenda.  Governments could select from a number of possible measures  choosing the most appropriate combinations for their situations.  With those two reports  he said  “the intergovernmental consultations to elaborate the post-2015 development agenda can start on a firm footing.” He also introduced a “Report of the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States” (document A/CONF.223/10) which rekindled the spirit of multilateralism and cooperation for small island developing States  and one on “Follow-up to and implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States” (document A/69/319)  which underlined how the International Year of Small Island Developing States had helped draw attention to the special situations of those countries. The “Overview report on the follow-up to Agenda 21 and Rio+20” (document A/69/312) referred to conclusions of the General Assembly dialogues on technology facilitation  while the report of the Secretary-General on “Mainstreaming of the three dimensions of sustainable development throughout the United Nations system (document A/69/79-E/2014) identified building blocks for that mainstreaming.  Rio+20 had provided a strong enabling intergovernmental mandate for that.  The report on “sustainable development of the Caribbean Sea for present and future generations” (document A/69/314) described national and regional activities to advance sustainable development of the Caribbean Sea.  Furthermore  it considered the possible legal and financial implications of designating the Caribbean Sea a special area within the context of sustainable development.  Other reports were on “Promotion of new and renewable sources of energy” (document A/69/323); “Reliable and stable transit of energy and its role in ensuring sustainable development and international cooperation” (document A/69/309); and on “Harmony with nature” (document A/69/322). MARGARETA WALLSTRÖM  Assistant Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction and Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action  introduced the Secretary-General’s report on the “Implementation of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction” (document A/69/364).  That document provided an overview of the preparatory process towards the Third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction to be held in Sendai  Japan in 2015.  Deliberations for the “pre-zero draft” framework for disaster risk reduction had indicated so far that Member States were conceptualizing three tiers for risk management  she said.  Those were the prevention of new risk  the reduction of existing risk  and the proactive building of resilience. MONIQUE BARBUT  Executive Secretary  United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification  introduced a report on Implementation of the United Nations Decade for Deserts and the Fight against Desertification (2010-2020) (document A/69/311) that listed several activities carried out by the Convention Secretariat and the United Nations to advocate for the Convention’s key aims.  It took stock of discussions of the Second Committee as part of its consultations on the sustainable development goals.  She also introduced the report on Implementation of United Nations environmental conventions (document A/69/317).  The report took stock of the activities of the Convention’s Secretariat and of the United Nations in connection with the decade and of initiatives taken to raise awareness of desertification  land degradation and drought. BRAULIO DIAS  Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity  introduced the Report of the Secretary-General to the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly on the work of the Convention on Biological Diversity (document A/69/317).  The report covered the preparations for the twelfth meeting of the Conference of Parties currently being held in Pyeongchang  Republic of Korea  from 6-17 October 2014. BLANCA JIMÉNEZ-CISNEROS  Director  Division of Water Sciences  United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  introduced the report on the “International Year of water cooperation”  pointing to rising demand for water and increased requirements for work to manage the issue.  The report provided an overview of the international year of cooperation and of World Water Day.  The document outlined the impact of the campaign  which aimed to raise awareness of water challenges  to foster partnerships and dialogue  to boost capacity and to contribute to the post-2015 development agenda and formulation of the sustainable development goals.  It took stock of progress and looked beyond 2013  noting that the Open Working Group had proposed a water-related sustainable development goal. JAMIL AMAD  Director-General  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)  presented the “Report of the United Nations Environment Assembly of the United Nations. Environment Programme” (document A/69/25)  noting 157 States had participated  with 110 at ministerial level.  The Assembly had considered the environmental dimensions of the sustainable development goals  with ministers stressing that transformation was possible as long as scaled-up actions were launched.  There was a focus on the need for adequate resources.  The challenges of illegal trade in wildlife were discussed  along with the trade’s consequences and governance.  Enhanced legal frameworks were needed to ensure implementation of agreements.  He also introduced a “Report on the Term of the board of the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production patterns” (document A/69/379). MOURAD WAHBA  Deputy Regional Director for Arab States  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  introduced the report on the “Oil slick on Lebanese shores”  which provided an update on the progress of implementation of previous General Assembly resolutions on the issue.  A study had been commissioned to measure and quantify the environmental damage  concluding that past research gave a solid base for measuring and quantifying damage.  Previous cost estimates did not include passive use value of coastal resources and the latest estimates included adjustments for inflation and lost opportunity due to interest rates. CHANTAL LINE CARPENTIER  New York Liaison Office of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  presented the report on “Entrepreneurship for development” (document A/69/320)  which documented recent trends and identified priority areas for entrepreneurship promotion.  The Open Working Group had recognized the importance of entrepreneurship and small and medium-sized enterprises to sustainable development.  Six steps were detailed in the report:  formation of national entrepreneurship strategies; regional environment optimization; education in entrepreneurship and necessary skills; facilitation of technological exchange and innovation; improvements of access to finance; and promotion of awareness and networking.  It made several recommendations for the United Nations to help improve the environment for entrepreneurship. MINORU TAKADA  speaking on behalf of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All  introduced the Secretary-General’s report on the “United Nations Decade of Sustainable Energy for All” (document A/69/395).  The report on the Decade (2014-2024) laid out broad pillars for a global plan of action. SARAH POOLE  Senior Regional Adviser  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  introduced the Secretary-General’s report on “International cooperation and coordination for the human and ecological rehabilitation and economic development of the Semipalatinsk region of Kazakhstan” (document A/69/257).  The report outlined the progress made in accelerating the development of the Semipalatinsk region between 2011 and 2013  through programmes and actions organized by the Government of Kazakhstan and the international community  including United Nations agencies.  The Government of Kazakhstan had achieved concrete results  and UNDP  with its partners  would continue to support it in ensuring sustainable livelihoods for people in the region. FERNANDO CASTELLANOS  Programme Officer  Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  introduced the report of the UNFCCC Executive Secretary on the United Nations Climate Change Conference  Warsaw  2013 (chapter I of document A/69/317).  The report outlined the main outcomes of the Conference  which were the decision on further advancing the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action towards achieving a firm global agreement in 2015; the establishment of the Warsaw international mechanism for loss and damage associated with climate change impacts; and the adoption of the Warsaw Framework for REDD-plus  which provided a comprehensive rulebook for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Questions The representative of Syria  referring to the Secretary-General’s report on the oil slick on Lebanese shores  welcomed the progress made regarding the assessment of the damage sustained in Lebanon.  However  he was concerned that the report did not include information on the damage to the environment along the cost of Syria. In response  Mr. WAHBA said that the report did mention the influence of the oil spill on the Syrian coastline  but it focused more on the effects in Lebanon.  He would take the remarks made by Syria’s representative to the report authors and request further information. VALERIA DENISSE VILASECA CHUMACERO (Bolivia)  speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  said that it was vital for all Member States to promote sustainable development in accordance with the Rio Principles.  Reaffirming the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  she went on to welcome a new research centre in Ecuador on the El Niño phenomenon.  The third International Conference on Small Island Developing States had been a success  and the Group further attached importance to disaster risk reduction and building resilience among communities and countries. Environmental degradation  more frequent and intense natural disasters  and the negative impact on nature resulting from human activity were of great concern  she said.  Fundamental changes were needed to the ways societies produced and consumed  and new pathways must be found for a transition to a culture of more frugal living.  On climate change  she urged that the Green Climate Fund be fully capitalized  and on desertification  she noted that related issues must be highlighted in the development agenda beyond 2015.  Biodiversity was also important  and all Member States must engage in finding a coherent approach to the loss of natural ecosystems. KEREETA WHYTE (Barbados)  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  and associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  CELAC  and the  Alliance of Small Island States  said the post-2015 development agenda must be people-centred and have poverty eradication at its core.  The outcome document of the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States constituted foundational input to the agenda.  Calling for issues related to small island developing States to be given priority on the High-Level Political Forum agenda  her Group welcomed the Outcome Document of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. Noting that a hurricane had recently swept through the eastern Caribbean  she said that should remind everyone of the perpetual threat faced by small islands and low-lying coastal developing States.  Calling for the successful agreement in Paris in 2015 on climate change  she noted that additional funding was needed for the Green Climate Fund  so that it could begin operations by 2015.  On regional policies  she noted that policies that aimed at transforming the energy sectors strived to ensure that all citizens had access to modern  clean and reliable energy supplies.  In that regard  several initiatives and partnerships had been launched  including the International Renewable Energy Agency’s “Lighthouse” initiative. JUAN CARLOS MENDOZA-GARCÍA (Costa Rica)  speaking on behalf of the CELAC  reaffirmed the Community’s commitment to actively engage in the next phase of the post-2015 agenda’s elaboration.  Highlighting the importance of the first meetings of the High Level Political Forum  he reaffirmed the Council’s role in achieving a balanced integration of the sustainable development pillars.  The Forum must be a platform for regular dialogue  with an action-oriented agenda  to ensure a focus on new and emerging challenges.  It should enhance cooperation with other relevant regional entities. While reaffirming the intergovernmental nature of negotiations on the post-2015 agenda  he recognized the contribution of major groups  social movements and civil society. He went on to welcome the adoption of the Samoa Pathway outcome document  underlining the importance of disaster-risk reduction and building resilience  which should be considered in the context of the post-2015 agenda.  The three goals outlined in the Convention on Biological Diversity should be pursued in a balanced  efficient manner  and urgent measures were needed to reduce  halt and reverse biodiversity loss.  Further  the UNFCCC was the primary intergovernmental forum for negotiating a global response to climate change.  Its principles and provisions should be respected. AMR ABDELLATIF ABOULATTA (Egypt)  speaking on behalf of the Arab Group  stressed the need for the effective implementation of sustainable development  as well as granting the necessary level of importance to the high-level political forum.  The post-2015 agenda had to aim for creation of just and sustainable global systems that consolidated developments  with concrete measures for implementation.  He welcomed dialogue on a mechanism for the consolidation of clean technology  and its transfer and distribution  and urged that negotiations continue.  He underlined the importance of challenges related to climate change  and emphasized the need for the start on the second stage of the Kyoto Protocol.  Failure to implement would have adverse dangers for the entire world  and he compared the danger to that of nuclear weapons.  Developed countries had to ease the burden and shoulder their responsibilities. A programme of action on energy within the United Nations framework was needed  he said  particularly on new and renewable sources of energy.  Water was vital to socioeconomic growth and equality.  Arab countries faced desertification  hampering agriculture  livestock and biodiversity and preventing fulfilment of development objectives.  An integrated process was needed to deal with the problem.  He welcomed the resolution establishing a framework to deal with sovereign debt problems of States and to assist countries coping with the financial crisis’s negative impacts.  It was time for the international community to shoulder its responsibilities and help those under occupation  particularly the Palestinian people. PORNPRAPAI GANJANARINTR (Thailand)  speaking on behalf of the ASEAN countries  and associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  recalled that three important intergovernmental processes would converge in 2015.  Those included the post-2015 agenda  the new climate agreement and the new framework for disaster risk reduction.  ASEAN was also working on the region’s post-2015 Vision.  She urged the Committee to explore ways to enhance national capacities in terms of good governance  accountability  and strong institutions in the effort to achieve the sustainable development goals.  She called for greater coherence and synergy with the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development  and the broader United Nations system. She said the Third International Conference on Financing for Development would be key in assuring strong and reliable means of implementation  in science  technology and innovation  finance  capacity-building and trade.  Through an open  rules-based  market-driven economy  ASEAN would be a key stepping stone to inclusive  sustained  and equitable growth in the region.  Because addressing climate change and disaster reduction was a priority for the its members  ASEAN would be strengthening resilience through several climate change initiatives and action plans  as well as improving prevention  preparedness  response  relief and recovery through strengthened ASEAN mechanisms and multisectoral actions. ESTHER M. C. NKHOMA (Malawi)  speaking on behalf of the African Group  and associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  looked forward to the Secretary-General’s synthesis report.  The Open Working Group’s proposal should be the main basis for integrating sustainable development goals into the post-2015 agenda  which should build upon the Millennium Development Goals and complete the unfinished business in a more sustainable manner.  Eradication of poverty remained a central and overarching goal  and was a prerequisite for attaining sustainable development.  The allocation of resources for the implementation of the agenda should take into consideration the needs of countries in special situations  and international partners must further support Africa’s development aspirations by meeting commitments in a timely manner. Africa would work with all partners to ensure a successful adoption of a legally binding climate agreement in Paris in 2015  she said.  That agreement should reinforce a multilateral rules-based climate regime that responded to science and fairness provisions of the UNFCCC.  Climate change posed a serious threat to her continent  which lacked the means or capacity to effectively adapt to and mitigate its effects.  She reiterated the need for developed countries to fulfil their commitment to mobilize $100 billion per year for the Green Climate Fund by 2020.  According to UNEP  Africa’s population was set to double to 2 billion by 2050  the majority of whom would depend on agriculture to make a living.  With 94 per cent of agriculture dependent on rainfall  the future impacts of climate change might reduce crop yields in some parts of the continent by 15 to 20 per cent. ABULKALAM ABDUL MOMEN (Bangladesh)  speaking on behalf of the Group of Least Developed Countries  and associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said the Millennium Development Goals experience had demonstrated that efforts to reduce poverty and improve social conditions could not be sustained over the long term without rapid and inclusive economic growth.  Building productive capacity  including through infrastructure  energy  quality education  technology and sustainable agriculture  was therefore essential to achieve lasting social progress.  It could also enable countries to mobilize more resources domestically  thereby reducing their over-reliance on the external sources of finance.  The post-2015 agenda should focus on building productive capacity to create decent poverty-eradicating employment  fund social services and provide a sustainable engine of growth. On climate change  he said that disasters were occurring with high magnitude and frequency  and had resulted in economic losses exceeding $200 billion.  The lack of adaptation capacity made least developed countries more exposed to the shocks.  The post-2015 agenda should focus on disaster risk and strengthening resilience.  Climate impacts were disproportionately affecting least developed countries; 51 per cent of the deaths caused by climate-related disasters between 1980 and 2013 had occurred in those countries  and during the last three years  that figure had risen to 67 per cent.  Moreover  sustainable development remained elusive for many such countries due to extreme poverty  and land degradation and desertification.  Thus  the post-2015 agenda must include a target on achieving a land-degradation neutral world. MARGO REMINISSE DEIYE (Nauru) spoke on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States and associated herself with the Group of 77 and China.  She said that the issues and priorities of small island developing States for sustainable development had been articulated at the opening of the Committee’s session.  They had to ensure that their voices were heard and no State was left behind.  The implementation of Agenda 21 was an important resolution for the group given its genesis in recognizing that small island developing States were a special case in sustainable development given their unique vulnerabilities.  She supported the High Level Political Forum as a dedicated platform for the implementation of sustainable development commitments. She urged the international community to implement the commitments set out in the Samoa Pathway  and to ensure its effective implementation and follow-up.  Climate change posed a significant risk to small island developing States and their efforts to achieve sustainable development  and  for many  it represented the gravest of threats to their survival and viability.  In that context  the outcome of the process launched under the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action should be a Protocol under the Convention  and must be legally binding and applicable to all parties  to be adopted no later than 2015. Mr. THIEBAULT (European Union) said the Committee’s discussions should not duplicate or pre-empt the negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda.  Many resolutions under that agenda item should thus not focus on substance but rather address relevant operational issues of resolutions dealing with the implementation of and follow-up to Rio+20  as well as with the modalities needing guidance from the Assembly.  The Committee should not engage in substantive discussions on disaster risk reduction  renewable energies  biodiversity  desertification and land degradation  all of which were discussed in intergovernmental fora or processes  and were expected to be addressed in the framework of the post-2015 development agenda. However  he believed that two resolutions needed a more proper discussion and guidance from the General Assembly.  The small island developing States resolution must discuss the proper Assembly follow-up to and implementation of the recently agreed Samoa Pathway.  Relating to the Habitat resolution  discussions on the remaining modalities for Habitat III and its preparatory process should be inclusive  efficient and cost-effective.  As in previous years  they would consider sustainable urban development as an integral part of the discussions on poverty eradication and sustainable development  and not under a separate agenda item. THEMBELA OSMOND NGCULU (South Africa)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and African Group  said the post-2015 agenda should build upon existing programmes and agendas.  The international community must acknowledge that countries had different starting points  national priorities and regional circumstances  and ensure the inclusion of all three dimensions of sustainable development without prioritizing one over the other.  Climate change was a pressing challenge  threatening the development gains made by humanity over the past decades.  An agreement must be reached on a global collective response which would balance development and environmental needs  and an equal priority must be given to adaptation and mitigation.  Moreover  the Green Climate Fund had a potential to serve as a mechanism to support low-emission and climate-resistant development patterns in developing countries. GUILHERME DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil) associated himself with the Group of 77 and China and CELAC.  Noting that as the High Level Political Forum had been created as a universal intergovernmental forum to provide political leadership and review progress in the implementation of the Rio+20 mandate and the post-2015 development agenda  the Assembly should ensure the Forum an effective role when implementing that agenda.  Looking forward to numerous conferences  including the twelfth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity  he noted that Brazil attached the utmost importance to enhancing cooperation on a response to climate change.  His country in 2009 had announced a voluntary commitment to reducing projected emissions by 36 per cent to 39 per cent by 2020.  Deforestation had also been reduced. RONIT BEN DOR (Israel) said the High Level Political Forum for Sustainable Development would be instrumental in putting sustainable development at the core of the United Nations system  and attached great importance to the engagement of all participants.  Israel proudly submitted the resolution on entrepreneurship for development  which included the importance of identifying indicators and enhancing data collection.  With 60 per cent of its country a desert  slowing the pace of decertification — exacerbated by unsustainable practices and climate change — ­was a high priority for Israel  and it attached great importance to cooperating with partners to tackle the issue.  Israel strongly believed that a sustainable world could not be built without gender equality  an open and inclusive society  and the participation of grassroots organizations. MAY-ELIN STENER (Norway) said that future sustainable development goals must be manageable for Governments  easily communicated to the public  and measurable for accountability.  Since sustainability was not possible without a response to global warming  a new climate agreement applicable to all was needed.  However  “we cannot simply wait for a new agreement”  she said  “we need action now while we negotiate”.  There was an urgent need for a global shift towards low carbon development  with the private sector playing a crucial role in providing solutions to mitigate and adapt to the impact of climate change.  Hence  a key priority for her country was to ensure that it used public resources to facilitate and leverage investments from the private sector.  Her Government was also committed to solving energy poverty and combating climate change  and was a key supporter of the Sustainable Energy for All initiative. Mr. SUÁREZ MORENO (Venezuela)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and CELAC  stressed the importance of political will when establishing strategies for poverty eradication and sustainable development.  Responsibilities and burdens were to be shared between States  as per the Rio+20 outcome.  He believed that the conclusions of the Open Working Group should be preserved with no renegotiation and the sustainable development goals should be incorporated in the new agenda  as proposed at Rio.  The means for implementation like aid and technology access were essential for developing countries to mitigate the unequal and unfair global economic structure.  The intergovernmental panel of experts would be vital ahead of the conference on financing for development.  He noted continued desertification and land degradation  pointing out climate change as an obstacle to sustainable development  poverty eradication and achievement of development goals.  Cooperation was necessary and developed countries should acknowledge their historical responsibility.  A meeting before the Lima Summit would be held in Venezuela  establishing a dialogue for joint action. MATEO ESTREME (Argentina)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and CELAC  called for balanced  global sustainable development based on the principle of solidarity  and one that aimed for poverty eradication above all.  Different levels of development  priorities and capacities had to be accounted for.  The proposals of the Open Working Group were balanced and should be the basis for negotiations on the post-2015 agenda.  Climate change was a global challenge  threatening the very existence of some countries.  It could not be de-coupled from development and poverty eradication efforts.  He hoped the Lima Conference would achieve a first draft of elements of a new climate change agreement.  The process had to be transparent and consensus-based.  Developed countries had to acknowledge their polluting history on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities  while the Green Climate Fund needed promotion.  He called for risk reduction management of natural disasters  new and discussed renewable energy and energy efficiency  desertification  and biodiversity. SARA LUNA CAMACHO (Mexico) said that her country would work to ensure the post-2015 agenda objectives included in all three dimensions of sustainable development.  A broad and integrated institutional vision on the subject and solid institutional structures were needed  and bureaucratic and overlapping structures should be avoided.  Synergies must be created between the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council through the High-Level Political Forum.  It was essential to establish a new framework for disaster risk reduction  and to join efforts in facing up to climate change challenges.  Her country  as a moderate emitter of greenhouse gases  would focus on adaptation measures to climate change  and was committed to conserving the world’s biodiversity. HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the ASEAN  said that his country’s commitment to promote sustainable development had been articulated through its national development plans  and it was currently on a trajectory to become a developed nation by 2020.  On climate change  he hoped for continued calls for Annex I countries to demonstrate stronger political commitment by taking deeper emission cuts.  Developed countries should play a more significant role in enhancing action on adaptation  as well as transparent and accessible climate finance to support small developing States.  His country had reduced the emissions intensity of its GDP by more than 33 per cent  and was on track to hit its target of 40 per cent reduction by 2020.  Moreover  it aimed to increase the share of renewable energy in the fuel mix to 10 per cent by 2020. TOMOKO ONISHI (Japan) affirmed her country’s commitment to meet the threat of climate change.  Japan had supported developing countries with funding totaling $16 billion over the course of 18 months.  Recently  Japan hosted the Innovation for Cool Earth Forum in Tokyo to share collective wisdom on energy efficiency technology innovation.  Since the decision at the ninth Conference of Parties  the country aimed to soon submit its contribution and had been considering a contribution to the Green Climate Fund.  Japan would share lessons learned at the upcoming Third World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction.  Additionally  the UNESCO World Conference on Education for Sustainable Development  which Japan would host in November  would provide an important platform for a Global Action Programme for “changing the way people think and act on this planet”. AMIT NARANG (India)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  reiterated his country’s unwavering commitment to sustainable development.  The objective should be to focus on the best way to integrate the sustainable development goals into the post-2015 agenda.  Developed countries should take the lead in moving their economies towards sustainable consumption and production  and as alternative technologies moved mainstream  developing countries would gain the ecological space to provide basic human development  and eradicate poverty and hunger.  Using the link between per capita energy consumption and the rank in human development index  India would have to increase fourfold its access to affordable energy to realize an uptick to the average development index.  Independent studies had shown that through several measures  India had reduced its use of oil by an average 791 million tons between 2000 and 2011. PALITHA KOHONA (Sri Lanka)  speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China  said it was essential that the twentieth Conference to the Parties would prepare a road map for 2015 Conference with “legally binding” and universal agreements.  Developed countries must deliver on their commitment to the developing world by providing financing  technology and capacity-building.  Despite Sri Lanka being a negligible contributor to climate change  it had been seriously impacted by its results.  Sri Lanka had drawn on the philosophy of Gautama the Buddha that the Earth does not belong to the rulers  who are only temporary custodians.  Consistent with that philosophy  his country would be increasing its land mass from 23 to 35 per cent  expanding renewable energy to the national grid  restoring estuaries and other natural habitats  and implementing a Green Transport System  a Fuel Quality Road Map  and watershed management system. HUA YE (China)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  said the report on sustainable development goals put eradication of poverty at its centre  and balanced economic  social and environmental pillars.  She called for the strengthening of the sustainable development mechanism and partnership  and for an enhanced role of the United Nations.  Her country firmly supported the 2015 Paris Conference to reach a new agreement based on the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities”.  In that context  developed countries should make greater efforts at reducing emissions  and should assist developing countries with finances  technology transfer and capacity-building.  China focused on environmental protection  and on promoting energy efficiency  emissions reductions and eco-awareness.  Moreover  it had been proactive in meeting climate change challenges  and it paid attention to disaster reduction and prevention. AMAN HASSEN (Ethiopia) associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  welcomed the consensus that the post-2015 development agenda should complete the Millennium Development Goals while it simultaneously addressed new challenges. Implementing the three dimensions of sustainable development hinged on reaching a legally binding climate agreement.  He called for the immediate and substantial capitalization of the Green Climate Fund.  Ethiopia had begun implementing its climate change strategies with the goal of reducing carbon emissions from 1.8 tons per capita in 2010  to 1.1 tons per capita in 2030.  Its success story in large-scale restoration and transformation of degraded highland areas through management interventions were indicated in the Secretary General’s report on the implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. Ethiopia’s disaster-risk management policy had been endorsed nationally and was now being finalized prior to implementation. DENIS ZDOROV (Belarus) said that the new post-2015 development agenda should include the sustainable development goals  noting that sanctions were obstacles to the most vital issues.  All States agreed that a far-reaching agreement should be met in Paris in 2015 on the topic of climate change.  To reach that goal  the basis for negotiations must be put into place now.  Belarus was prepared to participate in negotiations  and assist in their success  suggesting that a system in the environmental agreement could contain rewards for responsible States to develop climate-based technology as well as industrial infrastructure.  There was a need to create mechanisms to transfer technology in order to support sustainable development.  Belarus envisaged a comprehensive agenda based on the interests of all member states. Mr. ALI (Sudan) associated himself with the Group of 77 and China  the Group of Least Developed Countries  and the African Group.  His country had made serious efforts towards facing climate change  with a national plan in place that had many adaptation and mitigation projects integrated in development plans.  It was incumbent upon countries with historical responsibilities to meet commitments and create necessary policies that would reduce their emissions  and provide technological support.  Developing countries would be exposed to food insecurity from climate change; policies and programmes to face climate change should complement the other programmes aiming at providing sustainable food security.  Climate change was the main reason for a scarcity of water and food insecurity  and the reason for conflicts between farmers and shepherds.  MICHAEL GRANT (Canada) reminded that to complete the Millennium Development Goals  economic  social and environmental issues must be tackled in a holistic manner.  There remained much work to be done on three of the unfinished goals  starting with maternal  new born and child health.  The empowerment of women and girls was a prerequisite for poverty reduction  peace and sustainable development.  Furthermore  private sector-led sustained economic growth and job creation were key forces behind poverty reduction.  The necessity of integrating economic  social and environmental considerations into the approach had never been more apparent or urgent. SHEIKH AHMAD MOHAMED AL-THANI (Qatar)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Arab Group  said the preservation of the environment was the cornerstone of his country’s plans that maintained a balance between economic growth  social development and environmental management.  Qatar was committed to implementing the Agenda 21  the Johannesburg Plan and Rio+20.  As well  it had  together with the Dominican Republic and Turkey  come up with an initiative to use civil and military defence to respond to natural disasters effectively.  Moreover  to protect climate and biological diversity  it had signed numerous treaties on environmental sustainability.  He also highlighted the power of sustainable energy to eliminate poverty  and improve and save lives  while reducing environmental risks. RABEE JAWHARA (Syria) emphasized the role of the high-level political forum in directing international efforts towards sustainable development.  Over the years  his country had achieved much in the area of development  but the current situation targeted the security of the Syrian people  as well as the environment and natural resources.  He said that he wondered how Syria could appreciate the efforts of donor countries that set conditions and raised impediments to the financing by United Nations programmes providing aid for his country’s people.  An instance of that was the World Food Programme (WFP) which had announced a reduction in aid to Syria due to inadequate financing.  Concerning the oil slick on Lebanese shores  his country had made immense efforts to clean the Syrian coastline also affected by it  but had not received any international help in that regard. KHABAT AHMED NAJIB AL-BARWARI (Iraq)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  said the adoption of the strategy for disaster prevention would help countries move from relief to climate change adaptation.  It contributed to the reinforcing of disaster management programmes at the level of local communities  and helped developing countries to build their capabilities to adapt to disasters.  Iraq had adopted several measures  including the enactment of the civil defence law  the drafting of a project for disaster reduction in the country  and the establishment of a legal machinery to face disasters.  It had also established new buildings for civil defence  as well as search-and-save groups providing help to civil defence centres. AHMED SAREER (Maldives) associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and with Alliance of Small Island States  said that sustainable development was inherently linked with combating climate change  the consequences of which endangered the development gains his country had made so far.  While numerous initiatives had been taken nationally  such as declaring one atoll a United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) biosphere reserve  he questioned how much his nation could contribute on its own towards creating a more sustainable world.  The international community had to take prudent policy measures based on science.  In designing the post-2015 development agenda  lessons needed to be learned from the Millennium Development Goals.  As a large ocean State  Maldives welcomed the creation of a stand-alone goal within the new sustainable development goals focused on the protection of oceans. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-15,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gadis3503.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Speakers in the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) painted a bleak picture of the international response to the nuclear threat  as they discussed the unprecedented state of the global security environment on the penultimate day of that Committee’s general debate. The world was reaching a “point of no return”  warned the representative of San Marino  calling for strict control of “deadly arsenals” by arms manufacturers and those with access to them. All Member States should adopt new metrics of disarmament consisting of specific indicators measuring progress against commitments  he said  urging the international community to ensure that “intentions were fulfilled by actions”. In today’s unpredictable global security environment  asserted the representative of Lao People’s Democratic Republic  the continued existence of weapons of mass destruction was worrying  particularly  the possibility they could fall into the hands of terrorists and non-State actors. Indeed  the “tragic turn” of the terrorist threat required an international response  said the representative of Morocco.  Failing that  the threat of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists would “no longer be hypothetical”.  Nuclear and other mass destruction weapons did not guarantee international security and stability  he said  emphasizing that that required dialogue  mutual respect and partnerships that favoured sustainable human development. The nuclear threat was even more daunting  said the representative of Iran  when considering that those weapons were not just in storage  but associated with war strategies that contemplated their use.  The international community had a right to know that the nightmare inflicted upon the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki would never befall any other community again  he said. A just and secure world order remained elusive  said the representative of Pakistan  who warned that  despite expectation  the global security environment had deteriorated since the end of the cold war.  Security for all States was being trumped by “narrow selfish interests” as aims for world domination and hegemony had undermined a more rules-based  cooperative world. He added that absolute security for one State must not come at the cost of diminished security for others.  That trend had already “severely damaged” the international arms control  non-proliferation and disarmament regime. The policies of hegemony and the cold war  along with demonstrations of “strong arms and blackmail”  said the representative of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  were being repeated in an undisguised manner.  Moreover  targeted nuclear-war exercises by the largest nuclear-weapon State rendered conventions and treaties “meaningless” and drove the world to a nuclear arms race. Also speaking today were representatives of Costa Rica  Nicaragua  Nepal  Peru  Columbia  Paraguay  and Madagascar. General Assembly President  Sam Kutesa  also addressed the Committee. The First Committee will meet again at 3 p.m. on 16 October to conclude its general debate and begin its first round of thematic discussions. Background The First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) met this afternoon to continue its general debate.  For background  see Press Release GA/DIS/3497. MARITZA CHAN (Costa Rica)  speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  said her region had a long-standing tradition of promoting disarmament and arms control.  The CELAC States represented the first densely populated region of the world to have declared a zone free of nuclear weapons through the Treaty of Tlatelolco.  Recalling the 1996 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice  she said that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons was a crime against humanity and a violation of international law and the United Nations Charter.  She urged the international community to reiterate its concern on the humanitarian effects of nuclear weapons whenever the debate took place. She said CELAC would work to support a conference to eliminate nuclear weapons in the shortest possible time.  The international community should also work to adopt a global treaty  as soon as possible  to provide negative security assurances to the non-nuclear-weapon States.  She urgently called on all nuclear-weapon States to respect the denuclearized character of her region  and while she commended the Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms  progress had not been sufficient.  She rejected the modernization of existing weapons or the development of new ones  and added that those States with weapons on high alert should decrease their situational readiness.  At the same time  States had the inalienable right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. ZAMIR AKRAM (Pakistan)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that  contrary to expectations  the global security environment had increasingly deteriorated since the end of the cold war  as a “just and secure world order continued to elude us”.  Part of a zero-sum game  security for all States was being trumped by “narrow selfish interests”  he said.  Aims for world domination and hegemony had undermined engagement as the basis of a rules-based  cooperative world.  Absolute security for one State  he warned  could not come at the cost of diminished security for others.  That trend had “severely damaged” the international arms control  non-proliferation and disarmament regime. At the same time  he said  new weapons systems were being developed  including anti-ballistic missiles  non-nuclear strategic weapon systems  armed drones and lethal autonomous weapon systems  or LAWS.  Nuclear-weapon States must demonstrate renewed commitment in achieving nuclear disarmament within a “reasonable” timeframe  he said  adding that without that commitment  the “bargain of the non-proliferation regime” would continue to erode. JASSER JIMÉNEZ (Nicaragua)  associating with CELAC and the Non-Aligned Movement  said his country combated scourges of drug trafficking and organized crime  which undermined the very fabric of society.  Total disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction was his country’s ultimate goal.  Worldwide  more was spent on developing and testing weapons of all kinds than was spent on the development of human beings.  People were dying from diseases like Ebola  and yet military expenditures continued to increase.  It would be a historic day when the international community came together and expressed its hope for a world free from nuclear weapons.  That would save all on Mother Earth from a nuclear catastrophe.  Ultimately  all nuclear weapons should be eliminated  and a halt to all nuclear testing would be an important first step. SAM KUTESA  General Assembly President  said that a peaceful and secure world was the “basic building block” required for all peoples to enjoy lives of safety  prosperity and dignity.  The collective efforts of the First Committee would have broad implications on many other aspects of the Organization’s work  he said  adding that the promise of a more sustainable and prosperous future could not be fulfilled without ensuring peace and security for all.  True security was based on people’s welfare  including a growing economy  strong public health and education programmes  and fundamental respect for common humanity. GHOLAMHOSSEIN DEHGHANI (Iran)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that threats and challenges were an integral part of the world.  Among them was the threat posed by the continued existence of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons.  Those were not just in storage  but were associated with strategies and war plans that contemplated their use.  As long as the idea of achieving security with nuclear weapons formed the foundation of a few States’ military doctrines  such weapons would remain an ever-present threat to all mankind.  While the spread of nuclear weapons was enshrined in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  that was not its only pillar. He said it was a matter of serious concern that there was no indication that nuclear-weapon States were moving to fulfil their nuclear disarmament obligations.  Many delegations  therefore  had questioned their commitment to the process.  The international community had a right to know that the nightmare visited upon the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki would never befall any other community again.  Non-compliance with nuclear disarmament obligations  if not stopped  would gradually erode trust in the NPT.  The lack of resolve on the part of those States had also systematically stymied progress in the disarmament machinery.  Despite attempts by some to create doubts regarding Iran’s commitment to nuclear non-proliferation  his country had  for the past 12 months  engaged in earnest and serious negotiations to help build confidence in its peaceful nuclear programme. KHIANE PHANSOURIVONG (Lao People’s Democratic Republic) said that in today’s unpredictable global security environment  the international community needed to see improvement in the field of disarmament and international security.  The continued existence of weapons of mass destruction  particularly nuclear weapons  remained a matter of concern  especially due to the possibility that they could fall into the hands of terrorists and non-State actors.  The destructive power of nuclear weapons  and the threat they posed to the environment and human survival  meant they were “unique” in their catastrophic consequences.  Adherence to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty would contribute to promoting nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation  as would the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones.  At the same time  the international community could not afford to ignore the challenges posed by conventional weapons  and she welcomed progress in universalizing the Convention on Cluster Munitions. OMAR HILALE (Morocco)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Arab and African Groups  said that the tragic turn of the terrorist threat required an adequate international response.  Failing that  the threat of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists “would no longer be hypothetical”.  Nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction did not guarantee international security and stability  he said  adding that collective security rested in dialogue  mutual respect and economic partnerships that favoured sustainable human development.  In that regard  he welcomed multilateral discussions on nuclear weapons and hoped that the upcoming conference in Vienna would bring new momentum to that process. Accession to the NPT and adherence to the International Atomic Energy Agency was crucial to all countries in the Middle East  including Israel  he noted.  In that context  Morocco supported an international conference that would pave the way towards the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East  which would ultimately strengthen peace and security in the region. RI TONG IL (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that to build a peaceful and prosperous world  nuclear disarmament remained the first and foremost issue.  Policies of hegemony and the cold war  along with demonstrations of “strong arms and blackmail” were being repeated in an undisguised manner.  The largest nuclear-weapon State continued to blackmail one dignified United Nations Member State by opening targeted nuclear war exercises  despite unanimous demands by the international community.  Such actions made the NPT and other conventions and treaties “meaningless” and drove the entire world to a nuclear arms race.  Nuclear Powers’ passive approach  maintaining an aggressive nuclear doctrine and making only minimal reductions  only made a mockery of the international community.  “Nuclear war exercises” should be suspended immediately  and pre-emptive strike doctrines should be abandoned.  The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea welcomed any initiatives of the international community towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons. DURGA PRASAD BHATTARAI (Nepal)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that the impact of weapons of mass destruction “know no national or regional boundaries”  as the catastrophic consequences from large-scale nuclear disasters would pervade all countries  sectors  and economies.  No Power was immune to the consequences of such disasters  he warned.  The international community must therefore rise to its responsibility and forge a solid global commitment towards the non-proliferation and complete elimination of mass destruction weapons. As host of the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific  Nepal  he said  sought to revitalize the “Kathmandu process” to facilitate dialogue with the aim of fostering cooperation and confidence-building in the region.  While the Centre had made good progress to date  it relied heavily on voluntary contributions for its programmes.  As such  he called for its enhanced support from the international community  particularly by Member States from the Asia-Pacific region.  As in previous years  Nepal would be tabling a resolution on this issue at the current session of the Committee. ANA PEÑA DOIG (Peru)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and CELAC  said her country was concerned over the fabrication of small arms and light weapons and thus welcomed the 2001 Programme of Action in that regard.  A better exchange of information was necessary at the regional and international levels on tracking those weapons to help eliminate the illicit trade.  Regarding disarmament generally  confidence-building was important  and would also help to tackle issues of poverty  inequity and social exclusion  since more resources could be allocated to social development.  Peru sought the full implementation of the Hague Code of Conduct on missiles  with the aim of universalizing that instrument. DANIELE D. BODINI (San Marino) said that eliminating all weapons of mass destruction  be they nuclear  biological or chemical  must remain the world’s absolute priority.  The international community must not limit itself to reaffirming its long-term commitments  but should focus and ensure that intentions were fulfilled by actions.  The main focus of the United Nations was to maintain peace and security  yet all were witness to events of the world; even non-State actors could wage wars with heavy artillery  tanks and sophisticated weapons.  The world was reaching a “point of no-return”.  Arms manufacturing countries and those that had access to them must maintain strict control of their deadly arsenal.  All Member States should  as Angela Kane said  adopt new metrics of disarmament consisting of specific indicators for measuring progress in implementing commitments. MIGUEL CAMILO RUIZ (Colombia)  associating with CELAC  said his country had been active in living up to the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  To that end  Columbia was involved in peace dialogue on matters related to conventional arms  which remained particularly relevant to that country.  For more than 50 years  it had suffered from the impact of small arms and light weapons  which hindered its potential for development.  Thus  his country looked forward to the imminent entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty and its full implementation.  In the same vein  Columbia would be hosting a regional seminar on the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlateloco) to exchange experiences and gain expertise from the European Union.  Given the enormous scope of the conventional weapons challenge  work undertaken in line with the United Nations Programme of Action was also needed. LUIS BENÍTEZ RODRÍGUEZ (Paraguay)  associating with CELAC  said his country was committed to arms control in the maintenance of international peace and security.  More specifically  the effectiveness of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  to which it was a party  was a first step in ensuring that future generations could live in a world free of nuclear weapons.  As the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons had brought much grief and tragedy to countries in the region  he urged the international community to step up its efforts to curb that worrisome trend.  Efforts must also be accelerated in coordinating the tracking of those weapons globally.  Paraguay looked forward to the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty and was in the process of ratifying that Treaty soon.  For its part  the country was proud to have hosted a seminar providing technical guidelines on handling munitions and explosives. HÉLÉNA BERNADETTE RAJAONARIVELO (Madagascar)  associating with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  said the United Nations disarmament system continued to suffer from impasse.  She deplored the fact that the Disarmament Commission had not been able to achieve consensus since 1999.  Nevertheless  she reaffirmed its important role.  The very serious threat posed by the existence of nuclear weapons was clear  and global consideration of the issue must continue.  She joined calls aimed at nuclear Powers to uphold their obligations to eliminate those weapons.  Madagascar was in favour of the use of nuclear energy for economic development  and encouraged its research  generation and production.  She called on all NPT parties to show greater political will.  She welcomed the destruction of chemical weapons in Syria  and reiterated the importance of regional cooperation among States to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-15,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gashc4103.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. From battlefields in Iraq and Syria to online predators and recruitment by armed groups  children were facing an ever broadening number of threats and States must put words into action  the Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) heard today  as it began deliberations on children’s rights  one month away from the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. By recognizing two champions of children’s rights  the Nobel Peace Prize was acknowledging efforts to combat violence against and exploitation of children  said Maud de Boer-Buquicchio  Special Rapporteur on the sale of children  child prostitution and child pornography.  The situation was indeed grave.  From the abduction of girls in Nigeria and to the sale of girls and women in Iraq  rampant abuse and violence affected millions worldwide  she told Committee members  launching a wide-ranging discussion that included remarks from four other senior officials in the field.  After all  a right recognized was not the same as a right executed  Anthony Lake  Executive Director of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said.  “Imagine girls forced to relieve themselves in fields at night  at risk from sexual violence ” he said.  “Imagine boys weakened by hunger and thirst or helpless to the depredations of armed militia.” Despite progress in decreasing the number of deaths of children under five and HIV infections among children under 14 years  he noted that poverty continued to deprive children of their rights.  As many as 400 million of the world’s poor were under the age of 12.  Further  the unprecedented challenges of the moment  from conflict in Syria and Iraq to climate change and the Ebola crisis  were further undermining children’s well-being.  Calling on the international community to back up good intentions with strategic investments  he highlighted cost-effective solutions that used modern technologies  such as SMS  to improve communication and speed up the provision of children’s services. But new technologies were also causing new risks  cautioned Marta Santos Pais  Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children. Children were beginning to use media at younger ages than before.  Violent information  sexual predators  and cyberbullying were making new technologies unsafe for them.  For millions of children  the Convention was “a broken promise”  she added.  Levels of domestic violence  child neglect and abuse were increasing because of the high rates of unemployment and cuts in social spending. Leila Zerrougui  the Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict  called children the “primary victims” of armed conflict.  Expressing alarm about the trends of detaining children on security charges and attacking education and health care facilities  she called upon the international community to leverage the comparative advantages of all stakeholders. Partnerships with the European Union  African Union  and League of Arab States were enabling her office to rise to the daunting challenge of protecting the world’s children  she concluded.  In closing  she said Nobel Peace Prize recipient Malala Yousafzai was a symbol of all conflict-affected children  those who aspired and were moving towards a brighter future. Prior to the debate on the rights of children  the Third Committee members discussed the advancement of women  with statements delivered by representatives of Botswana  Lithuania  Malta  Georgia  Maldives  Venezuela  Republic of Korea  Sierra Leone  Bahrain  the Solomon Islands Ukraine  Afghanistan  San Marino  Burundi  Mauritania  Zambia  South Sudan  Ethiopia  Eritrea  Uganda  Angola  Albania  Niger  Azerbaijan  and Montenegro. The representatives of Japan  Republic of Korea and Russian Federation spoke in the exercise of the right to reply. The Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Thursday  16 October  to continue its general discussion on children’s rights.  It is also expected to take action on draft resolutions.  The Committee will then continue its discussion on the advancement of women on Friday  17 October.  Background The Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) met this morning to continue its general discussion on the advancement of women.  For background information  please see Press Release (GA/SHC/4102).  It would also begin its consideration of the promotion and protection of the rights of children. Before the Committee were reports of the Secretary-General on the status of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (document A/69/260) and on the follow-up to the special session of the General Assembly on children (document A/69/258). Also under consideration were the report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict (document A/69/212) and the annual report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children (document A/69/264). Statements MPHO MICHELLE MOGOBE (Botswana) said that her country had achieved varying degrees of success in gender mainstreaming  with women being offered opportunities for increased access  control and ownership of production resources  including land and property rights through the land policy.  There were also more women-specific opportunities in media and new communication technologies.  Given that a recent study showed that almost 67 per cent of women in Botswana had experienced some form of gender violence in their lifetime  she said it was important to remember that a significantly large proportion of those crimes went unreported for fear of public stigma and retribution from offenders.  Therefore  Botswana shared the Secretary-General’s observation that it was necessary to build the capacity of an institutional enforcement mechanism for addressing violence against women.  In closing  she said her country welcomed the inclusion of a stand-alone goal on gender equality in the post-2015 development agenda. NIDA JAKUBONĖ (Lithuania) said enhancing women’s participation in political  economic and socio-cultural life had been among the main priorities of her country’s domestic and foreign policy.  The post-2015 development agenda was creating a unique opportunity for accelerating measures to address critical issues regarding gender equality and the empowerment of women.  In that regard  she continued  the effectiveness of institutional mechanisms was of utmost importance.  To combat domestic violence  she said Lithuania had adopted a holistic approach  passing a law on protection against domestic violence and adopting a national programme for prevention and a provision of assistance to victims.  Concluding  she said 2015 would be a significant year in the field of women’s rights  as it would mark the twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the fifteenth anniversary of Security Council Resolution 1325 on women  peace and security.  CHRISTOPHER GRIMA (Malta) said his country had promoted gender mainstreaming as a strategic tool for safeguarding and promoting equality and the inclusion of everyone in the social  political and economic spheres.  Combatting discrimination at the workplace  particularly with regard to pay  conditions of work and career opportunities  was a Government priority.  Further  he noted  the post-2015 process should address the empowerment and rights of women and girls  gender equality and preventing and combatting violence against women.  In conclusion  he reaffirmed Malta’s support and commitment to the full implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action  adopted at the International Conference on Population and Development in 1994  and the Beijing Platform for Action. TAMTA KUPRADZE (Georgia) said that her country had carried out complex measures to address the rights of women.  Georgia continued to harmonize its domestic legislation in line with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and other international standards.  Moreover  several legislative changes had been made to enhance women’s employment by introducing more liberal regulations in the labour code.  Georgian legislation guaranteed equal access to education for all groups of the society  including women.  While Georgia was making gradual progress in advancing women’s rights  the Government had encountered serious obstacles in the occupied regions of the country where the humanitarian and human rights situation had deteriorated due to the intensification of barbed wire fence installation along the occupation line in the Tskhinvali region.  Women were the first targets in conflicts  she said  and their freedom of movement and other civil and economic rights in the occupied region were being blatantly violated on a daily basis. SHIRUZIMATH SAMEER (Maldives) quoted the report of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  which noted that her country was the highest ranking in gender equality and women’s empowerment in the South Asian region.  Laws guaranteed the same rights for women and men  she said  with legislation providing for  among other things  equal pay  three-month paid maternity leave and safe houses for abused women.  In addition  laws had been established to file complaints of sexual harassment and provide legal aid to victims of trafficking.  Yet equality in the law was not enough to bring empowerment to women  she said.  For that  a change in practices and perceptions was needed.  MARISELA EUGENIA GONZALEZ TOLOSA (Venezuela) noted the progress made in expanding areas for the empowerment of women  through their inclusion in political  economic and social life.  Strengthening capacities  autonomy and power for women influenced society as a whole  she added.  She also called for ending poverty using a structural approach.  On violence against women  she said protection mechanisms had been established in her country alongside measures to punish perpetrators and provide temporary shelters for women and children in violent situations.  HAHN CHOONGHEE (Republic of Korea) said the international community had made significant advances in the promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women.  Pointing out the linkage between gender equality  empowerment and violence against women  he said his country had sought to incorporate those issues into the post-2015 development agenda not only as a stand-alone goal but also as a cross-cutting issue.  He called for further promoting women’s participation in decision-making processes as it would contribute to the elimination of structural causes of gender discrimination.  It was also essential  he said  to facilitate women’s access to resources and education. In that regard  countries must take appropriate legislative and administrative measures to tackle discriminatory laws and practices hindering the empowerment of women.  Concluding  he underlined that it was the time to translate political will into concrete action.  EBUN ABEBOLA STRASSER-KING (Sierra Leone) said violence and many other challenges were setbacks against women realizing their full capabilities.  Despite tremendous efforts made at the national  regional and global levels to ensure gender equality and mainstreaming gender perspectives into all policies and programmes  she said  discrimination against women was still pervasive in society  undermining women’s self-esteem  dignity and full participation in development programmes.  Her Government had reaffirmed its commitment to the agenda on the advancement of women  especially in the African context.  To that end  she continued  Sierra Leone welcomed Africa’s ground-breaking initiatives and commitments relating to the declaration of the years 2010 to 2020 as the African Women’s Decade.  Concluding  she noted the persistent gaps in achieving the Millennium Development Goals on gender issues  calling upon Member States to ensure progress at all levels.    SUMA AL ALAIWAT (Bahrain) said her country had placed the needs of women in the forefront.  Emphasizing the significance of equal opportunity between women and men  she noted that her country had fully supported the post-2015 development agenda with a focus on gender equality and women’s empowerment.  For its part  Bahrain had seen achievements in gender equality in national initiatives promoting women’s rights  domestic stability and family unity  as well as in training programmes enabling women to enhance their skills. COLLIN BECK (Solomon Islands) said that despite many reports and bodies dealing with women’s advancement  there had been little action.  Poverty and climate change continued to deny women and girls in small island developing States and least developed countries their right to development.  Recent floods in his country had shaved off more than 9 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP).  Every year  the daily existence of women and girls was getting more difficult as the sea swallowed their land  disasters destroyed their homes and droughts threatened their food security.  His country was pleased that gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls had been given attention in a sustainable development context in the post-2015 agenda discussions and that climate change was also featured in the goals.  In closing  he said the Third Committee must monitor more closely the rights of women and girls to survive against climate change. YANA BOIKO (Ukraine) said her country remained fully committed to the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women  outcome documents of the Beijing Conference and twenty-third special session of the General Assembly.  Condemning trafficking in persons  especially women and children  she noted that the crime constituted an offence and a serious threat to human dignity and physical integrity  human rights and development.  To overcome that harmful practice  she continued  Ukraine had adopted a number of legislative documents aimed at strengthening its battle with human trafficking.  Turning to the Millennium Goals  she said Ukraine had made substantial progress over the past 13 years.  However  the conflict provoked in Ukraine and the illegal annexation of Crimea had devastating consequences  jeopardizing progress on the Millennium Goals. ZAHIR TANIN (Afghanistan) said that the recent presidential election meant a new beginning for the country  as well as for women.  “Afghan women have been liberated from the tyranny of Taliban ” he said  recognizing the valuable role they played in the society.  He noted the involvement of women in the election  including that millions voted despite threats they had received.  Five vice-presidential candidates were women and many were elected to seats in provincial council  he added.  In addition to increased political participation  women enjoyed broader access to education  business opportunities and health care.  Despite progress made  women had been affected by three decades of insecurity and conflict that had added obstacles  including negative traditional practices  a lack of jobs and poverty that were still impeding their involvement in all sectors of society.  DAMIANO BELEFFI (San Marino) said empowering women meant guaranteeing their access to schooling and education and their participation in political  social and economic life at all levels.  On violence against women  he said Parliament had adopted legal provisions that strengthened prevention and protection efforts and provided secure shelter  psychological counselling and other assistance to victims.  Moreover  San Marino’s Authority for Equal Opportunities was guaranteeing that data collection was undertaken on violence against women and gender violence. ALBERT SHINGIRO (Burundi) said 2015 would mark the twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and it was impossible to ignore half of the world’s population.  Despite international awareness  achieving the advancement of women and gender equality had remained challenging.  Stressing that discrimination  violence and poverty were major challenges in his country  he said the Government had revised its national gender policy to strengthen actions to eliminate the gender gap and set up a national protection system  adopting a penal code to punish human trafficking.  Thanking partners for their multidimensional contributions  he reiterated his Government’s commitment to addressing global challenges that women were facing. EL KHALIL EL HAGEN (Mauritania) said women were at the heart of his country’s national development strategy  which aimed at achieving gender equality and advancement by freeing them from economic  social and cultural obstacles.  Further  he said  the Government was committed to the goals of the 1995 World Summit for Social Development  Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action  Millennium Summit and the International Year of the Family.  Concluding  he reiterated his Government’s commitment to achieving the Millennium Goals  specifically the third goal related to the advancement of women.     DAISY NKHATA NG’AMBI (Zambia) said that her country was committed to the full and effective implementation of international agreements on gender and development to which it was a State party  including the Beijing Declaration and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  For its part  Zambia was promoting educational opportunities for girls and had introduced collaborative programmes that enhanced women’s participation in national development.  To match demands for tertiary education  the Government had embarked on the construction of more universities nationwide.  Further  the country had introduced a human rights curriculum at the primary school level.  Regarding a campaign promoting a zero-tolerance campaign against child  early and forced marriages  she said an interministerial committee was working in collaboration with traditional leaders.  With that in mind  Zambia  along with Canada  would be tabling a resolution that sought to highlight the negative effects of child  early and forced marriage. AGOK ANYAR MADUT (South Sudan) noted his country’s ambitious plan to achieve the Millennium Goals despite the short time left to the deadline.  Acknowledging the existence of gender inequality  he said women were marginalized in social  economic and political spheres.  Gender-based violence  he said  was commonly practiced in the country and to combat that issue  the Government had adopted a national plan for girls’ education.  The country was also tackling the issue of female genital mutilation.  Believing that education was a vital prerequisite to combating poverty by empowering women and protecting children from labour and sexual exploitation  he said specific programmes had been developed to provide qualified teachers and relevant curricula for general education.  Other initiatives addressed related issues  including high mortality rates  basic health  HIV/AIDS and malaria.  HUDA MOHAMED (Ethiopia) said gender equality was key to achieving sustainable development.  National programmes and policies had been developed to broaden women’s rights  including owning land.  To improve the economic status of women  initiatives revolved around facilitating financing and skills training.  In the health sector  free maternal services were provided  including 38 000 female health workers being deployed in rural areas.  To increase women’s participation in decision-making processes and their political involvement  the Government had provided for leadership training and scholarships for continued education.  Turning to violence against women  she said a special unit had been created to expedite cases on abuse and provide free legal aid to victims of violence. ELSA HAILE (Eritrea) said major interventions to achieve gender equality and women empowerment had focused on education  health  economic empowerment  power-sharing and decision-making processes.  Violence against women was regarded as a punishable criminal offense  she added.  In addition to domestic violence  the most predominant forms of violence were harmful traditional practices  such as female genital mutilation  and underage marriage  she said  noting that both had been criminalized.  To raise awareness of those and related issues  concerted and coordinated media and grass roots campaigns had been carried out with the involvement of community and religious leaders.  Consistent with its laws against human trafficking  Eritrea had also prioritized protecting victims and combating trafficking in persons and was working closely with neighbouring countries to uproot that phenomenon. RICHARD NDUHUURA (Uganda)  aligning his delegation with statements delivered on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  as well as the African Group  said that his country had established policies and legislation addressing issues related to women.  Uganda’s affirmative action policy had resulted in women in leadership positions.  The country was on track to achieving gender parity in education at the primary school level and had extended microcredit opportunities to rural women.  Despite those successes  there was still work to be done  he said  especially in reducing teenage pregnancy and tackling the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in women.  Eliminating gender inequality  he concluded  was a precondition for the advancement of humankind. MARGARIDA IZATA (Angola) said that her Government was continuing to improve the conditions of women in all spheres of national life  including the public sector.  Rural women were an integral part of the country’s development process and were the focus of many Government policies under the 2013-2017 national development plan.  Citing examples of supportive projects  she described a family farming programme as well as literacy and technical support programmes for midwives in rural areas.  She reiterated her delegation’s support of United Nations bodies that were working to ensure the empowerment of women and the elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against them. ERVIN NINA (Albania) said his country was fully committed to the promotion and protection of all human rights as well as to the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and the Cairo Programme of Action and the outcomes of their review conferences.  Albania had improved its domestic legal framework related to the protection of women’s rights by the ratification of key international documents and their amendments to ensure compliance of national legislation with international law.  Further  he said  the right to free legal aid was a very important component of ensuring the rights of victims of domestic violence.  In that regard  the Government and civil society had greatly assisted in increasing awareness about gender issues. HALIMATOU DJIBO SADDY (Niger) said the protection of women and their rights were priorities for her country and could be seen in their very active participation in social  economic and political life.  For its part  the Government had established a number of programmes at the national level to combat gender-based violence and allow all citizens to fully enjoy their rights.  She also noted that the Government had adopted laws punishing the practice of female genital mutilation in the country.  However  there was long way to go to address challenges and fully achieve equal opportunities and social justice  she concluded. GUNAY RAHIMOVA (Azerbaijan) said greater attention should be paid to the issue of violence against women and girls in times of armed conflict  which frequently created an environment conducive to the systematic violations of human rights.  He welcomed the emphasis place on the importance of policies to end impunity and promote a culture of accountability.  Further  Security Council resolution 1325 on women  peace and security should ensure that the rule of law in conflict and post-conflict situations promoted justice and accountability that furthered women’s rights.  For its part in facilitating women’s access to justice  Azerbaijan had increased the number of female police officers as well as social resources to meet the needs of victims. MILORAD ŠĆEPANOVIĆ (Montenegro)  aligning his delegation with a statement delivered on behalf of the European Union  said that his country was party to all major international instruments for the protection of the human rights of women  including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  For its part  Montenegro had paid particular attention to a number of issues  including greater participation of women in political life  their access to decision-making positions  economic empowerment and encouraging female entrepreneurship.  The Parliament had also adopted legislation with regard to gender balance on the electoral list.  Recognizing the important role of women in peacekeeping and peacebuilding  he reiterated Montenegro’s support for Security Council resolution 1325. Rights of Reply Speaking in exercise of the right of reply  a representative of Japan addressed the issue of comfort women  saying that the Prime Minister Shinzō Abe had the same view as his predecessors on the issue. Responding to that intervention  a representative of the Republic of Korea said his Government was deeply concerned that Japan continued to deny its legal obligations  ignoring repeated international calls to address the matter in a sincere manner.  Recent remarks and actions made by the Japanese leadership had shown contrast with its position  he said  especially in light of the re-examination of the Kono statement. Also speaking in exercise of the right to reply  a representative of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine’s use of armed forces in the south of the country had caused the deaths of civilians  including women.  He said he rejected the fictional accusations made by Ukraine. Speaking in exercise of a second right of reply  Japan’s representative said the legal issue of reparation had been finally resolved and that the Prime Minister had no intention of reviewing the Kono statement. In response  the Republic of Korea’s representative said that it was time for Japan to recognize to responsibility of its actions and to take steps to prove its sincerity. Interactive Dialogue on Rights of Children The Committee then began consideration of the promotion and protection of the rights of children  including the introduction of reports and an interactive discussion. ANTHONY LAKE  Executive Director  United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  presenting the Secretary-General’s reports on the status of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (document A/69/257) and the follow-up to the special session of the General Assembly on children (document A/69/269)  said that life was getting better for millions of children.  Between 1990 and 2013  the number of children under age 5 who died each year had been halved and HIV infections among children under age 14 had declined by nearly 60 per cent. But for too many millions of children  life was a struggle  with almost half the population living in extreme poverty being under 18 and 400 million of the world’s poor under age 12.  “Imagine girls forced to relieve themselves in fields at night  at risk from sexual violence ” he said.  “Imagine boys weakened by hunger and thirst or helpless to the depredations of armed militia.”  Urging nations to sign and ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child  which would next month reach its twenty-fifth anniversary  he said a recognized right was not automatically an executed right.  Society’s strength was secured not through good intentions but through strategic investments  he continued  adding that current challenges  such as conflicts in Syria and Iraq  climate change and the Ebola crisis  were undermining children’s well-being.  “Children’s lives and children’s rights are at stake ” he said  noting that 17 000 children under age five died every day  mostly of preventable causes  and 250 million primary school age children still failed to learn basic literacy or arithmetic.  The age-old problem of inequality continued to pose challenges. At the same  innovative solutions were coming to the forefront  he added  highlighting the U-report  an SMS-based service in Uganda  and Project Mwana in Zambia  which used rapid SMS to speed up the HIV diagnosis process in infants.  Innovations such as those reminded the international community that progress was not only possible  it could benefit the most marginalized children more efficiently and more cost-effectively than ever before. LEILA ZERROUGUI  Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict  introducing her report (document A/69/212)  said as armed conflicts continued around the world  51 million people  mostly women and children  were displaced globally in 2013 and another 2.5 million in the first six months of 2014.  Since children were the primary victims  she was concerned by the trend of detaining them on security charges in conflict situations  including in Somalia  Afghanistan  Democratic Republic of Congo  Syria  Central African Republic  South Sudan  Iraq and Gaza. Stressing the alarming trend of attacks on education and health care facilities  she deplored the deliberate targeting of schoolchildren  teachers and educational institutions.  In Nigeria  Boko Haram was inflicting brutal attacks on young people  directly targeting education as a tactic of warfare  including the abduction of schoolgirls in Chibok  which had shown gaps in protection mechanisms for such children.  In that regard  the choice of Malala Yousafzai as the Nobel Prize winner was sending a message that the world must act together to ensure that children affected by conflict could continue to learn and build brighter future. The daunting challenge of protecting children affected by conflict could be overcome by leveraging all stakeholders’ comparative advantages.  Her office and UNICEF had engaged in mainstreaming child protection with the African Union.  Further  the United Nations had signed a partnership agreement with the League of Arab States to develop a framework for joint actions to protect children affected by armed conflict  she said  expressing confidence that partnerships would grow.  Concluding  she strongly encouraged governments to support the work of child protection actors  facilitate establishing dialogue and verify the implementation of commitments they had made. MARTA SANTOS PAIS  Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children  presenting her annual report (document A/69/264)  said that the Convention was a ground-breaking document that raised children above politics and marked a turning point in the way children were seen in society  not as passive beneficiaries  but as true subjects of rights and agents of change.  As such  freedom from violence remained at the heart of the instrument and many high-level government mechanisms and national legislation had been created to ensure that. But for millions of children  she said  the Convention was “a broken promise”.  Marginalized children had been the hardest hit  she lamented  even in countries with advanced economies.  High levels of unemployment together with social spending cuts were leading to increased levels of domestic violence  child neglect and abuse.  Highlighting the fate of some children  such as those with albinism and those accused of witchcraft  she said consequences ranged from social exclusion to torture.  Because of fear or indifference  the plight of those children was largely met with silence  she stated. Given the rapid pace at which information and communication technology was evolving  she added  more and more children were using those means  starting at younger ages.  Some new technologies had been associated with higher risk  however  whereby children could be exposed to violent information  groomed by sexual predators or subjected to cyberbullying.  Accelerating progress in children’s online safety was a high priority for her office  she said calling on the international community to work towards a world with the vision  energy and power to achieve freedom from violence for all children. In the ensuing interactive dialogue  several delegates asked for more information about efforts to engage with non-State armed actors and the best way to reintegrate and rehabilitate children affected by armed conflict.  Others raised questions on a range of issues  from preventive and curative measures for the Ebola crisis to aspects of children’s rights that should be part of the post-2015 agenda.  Some speakers also encouraged Ms. Zerrougui to continue to hold regular dialogues with non-State armed actors that were recruiting children. A number of questions came from speakers representing conflict-affected countries  including the representative of Palestine  who asked for more information about psycho-social support services for those affected by the recent 50-day bombardment and destruction of schools and homes by Israel.  Syria’s delegate said that the Office of the Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict was naïve not to condemn the recent double bombing that took place in Syria as a terrorist attack.  Israel’s representative asked if the United Nations had been able to document the use of schools in Gaza to store weapons and the use of children as human shields by Hamas. Responding  Ms. ZERROUGUI said that despite legal prohibitions in various countries  the recruitment of children in conflict continued.  So it was not just a matter of political will  but also of capacity.  It was  therefore  up to bilateral partners to support initiatives in countries such as Somalia and Yemen to prevent recruitment.  Children released from armed conflict  she added  needed to be reintegrated and that was the weakest part of the work on the ground.  More long-term programmes were needed  she said  as a child released from an armed group may have undergone radicalization and needed services to fully heal and return to society.  “We need to work not only on the child  but also on the community ” she added.  The demobilization and peacekeeping programs must consider children to be sustainable. Multidimensional strategies  including sanctions and military pressures  were necessary to work with non-State armed actors  she continued  noting that her office was finalizing agreements engaging with groups who had reached out to her.  It was important to not just sign agreements  but to monitor the implementation of the agreement. Ms. PAIS added that the post-2015 agenda was a golden opportunity and children had participated in her office’s survey and various national consultations.  Her office was developing child-friendly  interactive materials to continue to engage with them.  Further  she added  there was no “perfect” country where violence against children did not happen.  Her office was working with various regional organizations that were powerful actors in combating violence against children. Mr. LAKE said that UNICEF had reached out to 30 000 children through direct counselling in camps  text messages  caregivers and families  hot-lines and training teachers.  The aim  he continued  was not just to repair the infrastructure but the hearts and minds of the children.  Looking at three countries  the United Nations had responded as fast as possible to provide support to governments. On Ebola  he said the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) had been launched  aimed at defeating that outbreak with continuous work with health workers in affected countries.  MAUD DE BOER-BUQUICCHIO  Special Rapporteur on the sale of children  child prostitution and child pornography  said the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize had recognized two champions for their efforts to combat the exploitation of and violence against children.  Millions of children continued to be victims of sexual exploitation  organ trafficking  forced labour and illegal adoption.  Recalling the abduction of 600 girls in Nigeria  she noted that children were especially vulnerable in conflict situations.  In Iraq  reports had shown that “the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS)” had set up an office in Mosul for the sale of abducted girls and women  brought with price tags for the buyers to choose and negotiate over. Providing an overview of challenges  she said her first thematic report to be presented to the General Assembly next year would be devoted to the issue of information and communication technologies and sexual exploitation of children  reflecting new trends and threats  as well as on the potential of children to contribute to combating those crimes.  Advocacy priorities aiming at the universal ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child  rehabilitation and prevention had also been identified as priorities  she said.  Research on the sale of children for the purpose of illegal adoption and on the demand factor underpinning the sale and sexual exploitation of children would also be conducted  she said  to shed a light on the causes of the phenomenon and provide policy guidance to prevention efforts. During her tenure  she would continue to take a consultative and participatory approach in the implementation of her mandate  she added  acting as a facilitator of action-oriented dialogue between key stakeholders.  A gender perspective would be integrated throughout her work  because the scourge of the sale and sexual exploitation of children affected boys and girls in different ways.  Recalling the twenty-fifth anniversary of the creation of her mandate  as well as the fifteenth anniversary of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child  she called on the international community to live up to its commitment by stepping up efforts to combat and prevent the sexual abuse and exploitation of children.  KIRSTEN SANDBERG  Chair of the Committee on the Rights of the Child  said ahead of celebrations of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention  the Committee had hosted an online dialogue between members and 28 children from 14 countries.  When different generations communicated in a spirit of mutual respect  they could combine their ideas and produce innovative solutions to challenges that faced societies  with young participants bringing forth ideas on how to support children that experienced violence in different ways  prevention and the need to raise awareness about the lasting effects of violence. Highlighting advancements that included increased legislation and policies related to children’s rights  more children going to school  and a more widespread use of restorative justice and alternative dispute resolution relating to children  she said millions of children were still suffering from negligence  violence  abuse and exploitation at home  at school  in institutions and in the community.  She encouraged States to combat all violence against children  with a focus on changing attitudes and bringing those responsible to justice  as well as investing in special protection programmes and strengthening child protection systems.  She then noted the challenges faced by migrant children  children in armed conflicts and children deprived of liberty. Turning to the issue of digital media and children’s rights  she described a general discussion organized last month to develop rights-based strategies to ensure the equal access to digital media for children and maximize their online opportunities and engagement  while protecting them from risks and possible harm without restricting any benefits.  Conclusions from the discussion addressed areas such as access to information and communication technologies for different groups of children  the importance of digital literacy  online safety concerns  cooperation between States and telecommunications companies and data collection.  In conclusion  she noted that the pace of the ratification of the three Optional Protocol to the Convention had lost its impetus  encouraging States that had not already done so to ratify the Convention itself and its Optional Protocols. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-14,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gashc4102.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. As discussions begin shaping the post-2015 development agenda  women must have a strong presence to cement the intrinsic link between achieving gender equality worldwide and the global goals of sustainable development and eradication of poverty  the Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural)  heard today during the second day of its thematic debate. “It is not enough for women to be in the room ” said Canada’s speaker  “they must be at the head table.”  He  along with many others  supported inclusion in the new agenda of women’s empowerment as a stand-alone goal. Since next year would also see the confluence of several major United Nations processes  including the 20-year review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action  the end of the Millennium Development Goals era and start of a new one  Member States should seize the opportunity to further advance women’s rights  many delegates agreed. Despite current successes  many speakers lamented that more must be done.  South Africa’s delegate said that in the 19 years since the creation of the Beijing Declaration  much remained to be done to succeed in making substantial progress.  A delegate from Zimbabwe said “poverty continues to wear a feminine face and women continue to be victims of violence both in…private and public life” in spite of the progress made towards gender equality and women’s empowerment. A number of delegates also discussed the grim reality of women facing crimes and abuses by occupying powers and armed groups  including “the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS)”.  Iraq’s speaker said women had faced horrendous attacks at the hands of ISIL.  A speaker from the Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine said that Israel’s occupation had stifled Palestinian women’s efforts to realize national strategic plans and programmes geared towards their empowerment  much less implement international development instruments. Still  many speakers described how new laws and initiatives had addressed a range of issues regarding women’s rights  from maternity leave to the right to own land.  Some speakers  such as Nepal and Belarus  reported reaching gender-related Millennium Goals ahead of next year’s deadline.  Speakers also said that women had also made enormous national gains in the political sphere  including the Dominican Republic’s delegate  who said women had surpassed men on the electoral roll in her country. Another common thread at the day-long meeting was many speakers agreeing that barriers to gender equality must fall.  Bolivia’s delegate echoed that call  stating that gender equality could only be achieved by questioning the patriarchal systems that allowed for their subordination.  To tackle discrimination  New Zealand’s delegate said “diverse women facing diverse challenges” required targeted approaches to ensure they had access to equal opportunities.  Also participating today were speakers representing Egypt  Mongolia  Libya  Saudi Arabia  Namibia  Finland  Pakistan  Viet Nam  Peru  Thailand  Sri Lanka  Oman  Qatar  China  Kazakhstan  Ecuador  Paraguay  Cambodia  Panama  Kenya  Nigeria  Sudan  Iran  Norway  United Republic of Tanzania  Lebanon  Haiti  El Salvador  Yemen  Turkey  Jordan  Burkina Faso  Indonesia  Congo  Rwanda  Cabo Verde  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Chile and Argentina as well as the Holy See. Also speaking in exercise of the right of reply were representatives of Israel as well as the Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine. The Third Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Wednesday  15 October to conclude its discussion on the advancement of women and take up its agenda item on the rights of children. Background The Third Committee met this morning to continue its consideration of the advancement of women.  For background information  see Press Release GA/SHC/4101. Statements MICHAEL DOUGLAS GRANT (Canada) said the advancement and protection of the human rights of women and girls were key priorities for his Government.  “It is not enough for women to be in the room ” he said  “they must be at the head table.”  Further  Canada strongly supported inclusion in the post-2015 development agenda of a stand-alone goal on the empowerment of women and girls  which focused on the structural drivers of inequality.  In that regard  the advancement of women and girls acted as a multiplier force on development goals  including maternal  newborn  and child health  as central to the post-2015 agenda.  Further  he noted that the Government was joining the United Kingdom for an assessment mission in Iraq to identify initiatives that would help victims of  crimes and abuse attributed to “the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS)”.  His Government would continue to provide leadership on the issue of sexual violence  ensuring that the plight of victims and survivors of ISIL’s attacks remained at the top of the global agenda. TSHAMANO COMBRICK MILUBI (South Africa) said it had been 19 years since the creation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action  yet much needed to be done to make substantial progress in advancing women’s rights.  Job creation  education  health  rural development  food security and land reform  as well as fighting crime and corruption  had been adopted as South Africa’s five national priorities  in which gender equality and the advancement of women’s human rights had been placed at the centre.  Recognizing the positive impact of UN Women  he reiterated his Government’s commitment to addressing existing challenges to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women. MILDRED GUZMÁN MADERA (Dominican Republic) recalled that her country had proposed to the General Assembly the celebration of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.  Today  women in her country surpassed men on the electoral roll  indicating that their vote was decisive.  In the last decade  the Dominican Republic had two female vice-presidents as well as several women judges.  The Government was also implementing measures to support rural women  including the introduction of solidarity banks that provided microcredit and credit to women.  Paying tribute to the United Nations bodies that were coordinating the Organization’s efforts to achieve gender equality  she lauded the extraordinary progress made by UN Women. OSAMA ABDELKHALEK MAHMOUD (Egypt) said that the critical vulnerable position of women in humanitarian situations all over the globe was alarming.  Trafficking of women  especially minorities  had increased in the past months.  Highlighting recent developments in his country  he said that the new Egyptian constitution had introduced provisions to ensure that women were free from violence.  Female genital mutilation was one of the forms of violence that had been fully criminalized according to Egyptian laws.  In order to address the challenge of underreporting of violence against women  the Government had been raising awareness and increased the number of female police officers.  In closing  he said Egypt was committed to all international conventions for the protection of the human rights of women. ENKHTSETSEG OCHIR (Mongolia) said a national programme on gender equality had been designed to combat violence against women  support rural women’s development and promote women’s political participation and economic empowerment while ensuring equal access to technology and other assets.  Supporting the recommendations set forth in the Secretary-General’s report on trafficking of women and girls  she called for reinforced efforts and resources in the area of prevention  focusing on the root causes of trafficking.  In closing  she said “poverty  unemployment [and] gender inequality are among the main factors that make people  particularly women and girls  vulnerable to trafficking.” ZAHRAA SALMAN (Iraq) said her Government had adopted numerous measures to tackle domestic violence against women  including a programme involving police officers.  In addition  the Ministry of Social Affairs sought to build national capacity to improve gender parity through training in technical and vocational skills and Iraq’s constitution enabled women to participate in policy design.  Yet  she continued  Iraqi women had been suffering from the horrendous attacks by ISIL while the Government was doing its best to assist survivors and those in areas under the control of terrorist groups. MALAK SALIM (Libya) said her country had acceded to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and its protocol so that Libyan women enjoyed the right to health services  education  equal wages  social security and pensions  ownership and participation in all social and economic activities.  However  she said  Libya was going through a critical stage as women and children faced extraordinary challenges due to trafficking and conflict between armed groups  leading to displacement and violence.  Further  she noted that Libya’s constitution promoted gender equality.  Women occupied 16 per cent of the National Congress  and the Constitution Drafting Committee had female members.  Concluding  she called for the protection of Palestinian women living under Israeli occupation. RANIA TALAL A. ABDULBAQI (Saudi Arabia) said that her Government had taken several measures to ensure the advancement of the Saudi woman in all development programmes  while preserving “her Islamic and Arabic identity”.  Saudi women had proven their ability to be productive within society and had held high positions in many educational  cultural  political  legal and media sectors  in addition to serving on the consultative shura council.  Several Government agencies  in partnership with civil society organizations  had launched a national campaign to raise women’s awareness about their rights with regard to maternity protection  occupational health services  study leave with pay  social welfare services and personal status procedures relating to marriage  divorce and birth registration.  Saudi Arabia’s accession to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women affirmed its commitment to further women’s human rights in accordance with the Islamic sharia and international standards. WILFRIED EMVULA (Namibia) said the advancement of women was key to socio-economic development.  In that vein  a specific national programme had been designed to promote income-generating activities and small- and medium-sized enterprises run by rural women in order to increase employment opportunities and improve living conditions.  On violence against women  he noted that victims tended to choose not to report incidents due to social stigma  cultural restrictions  limited information about their rights  high legal costs  complexity of criminal processes and lack of confidence in authorities.  To address those challenges  a number of initiatives were ongoing  including awareness-raising campaigns  legal literacy programmes and projects targeting men and boys to change their behaviour on negative gender stereotypes. KAI JÜRGEN MIKAEL SAUER (Finland) said that education increased job opportunities  improved earnings and reduced maternal mortality.  Therefore  a lack of educational opportunities came with very heavy costs.  Remedies included quality teacher training  removing primary school fees and making school environments safer and sanitary.  Many girls dropped out of schools when they reached puberty because of a lack of safe spaces for menstrual hygiene.  Women and girls were also subjected to discrimination in ownership of property  which limited their decision-making capacities.  Discussions on both climate change and food security must be interlinked with gender equality  he said.  For its part  Finland encouraged men to become more active partners.  Gender equality was not just a human rights issue  he concluded  it was also an economic and social question. ILLA MAINALI (Nepal) said that despite emerging from conflict  Nepal had made significant progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  The majority of health-related goals had already been achieved  and the targets related to poverty  hunger and universal primary education were likely to be achieved by 2015.  Her Government had adopted a five-year national strategy related to gender empowerment and was making a sustained effort to review laws that discriminated based on gender  age  class  caste and ethnicity.  Further  Nepal had established the Anti-Human Trafficking Act in 2007 and was party to seven core international human rights instruments  including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. DIYAR KHAN (Pakistan) said 2015 would witness the confluence of several major United Nations processes  including the 20-year review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action  end of Millennium Development Goals and start of the post-2015 development agenda.  Underlining that violence against women remained a universal concern  he said it was vital that the post-2015 agenda addressed women’s empowerment in a more holistic and effective manner.  For its part  his Government had taken steps to promote women’s participation in all stages of political and economic decision-making.  Women occupied 69 of the 342 seats of the National Assembly and 17 of the 100 seats in the Senate.  Pakistan was the first country in the region to set up the First Women Bank  which had been promoting asset ownership for women by financing women-dominated business entities throughout the country since 1989. FREDERICK MUSIIWA MAKAMURE SHAVA (Zimbabwe) said that despite progress made towards gender equality and women’s empowerment  “poverty continues to wear a feminine face and women continue to be victims of violence both in their private and public life”.  Conscious of the importance of legislative measures for creating an environment conducive to gender equality  he noted the need for the implementation of those laws.  With regards to violence against women  he called for awareness-raising efforts as well as education of both for women and men.  NGUYễN PHƯƠNG NGA (Viet Nam) said sustainable development could not be realized without equality for and empowerment of half of the world’s population.  At the national level  despite progress made in those areas  she noted that there was persistent violence against women and girls  a need to address the gender pay gap and the issue of women living in remote areas who fell victim to local customs.  In addition  she noted that climate change and natural disasters were affecting women disproportionately.  She reaffirmed her country’s commitment to redouble its efforts  combined with effective international cooperation  to address those challenges.  GUSTAVO MEZA-CUADRA VELÁSQUEZ (Peru) said that his Government was an active partner in gender-inclusive development and was cooperating with various United Nations bodies to mainstream gender into public policies.  Peru had recently adopted a law on feminicide  according to which the minimum punishment would be 15 years of imprisonment with a maximum of life  if warranted.  The definition of feminicide was also revised to include “intimate feminicide” when such acts occurred within families. KIRADIT SACHDEV (Thailand) said gender equality was becoming a reality in many places around the world  noting that increasing numbers of women were taking up high positions in public and private sectors.  Despite that achievement  he continued  violence against women remained a pressing issue  especially in relation to sexual harassment in the workplace  gender-related killing and trafficking.  Efforts that had been made to address those issues included special investigations  prosecutions and convictions of perpetrators  as well as the protection of victims. PALITHA T. B. KOHONA (Sri Lanka) noted the progress made by his country in the areas of education  health and political participation of women.  Since the country’s internal conflict  he added  addressing women’s issues had become critically important  as the number of female-headed households had increased.  Measures had been taken to assess their condition  identify vulnerabilities and address their needs  while supporting them in overcoming the psycho-social trauma of conflict  he added.  The anticipated decline in the population would affect the labour market  he continued.  To address that issue  the participation of women in the labour market had been expanded by improving women’s access to vocational training  science  technology and continuing education. IRINA VELICHKO (Belarus) said her country had met the Millennium Development Goals on gender equality before 2015.  Having among the lowest maternal mortality ratios  with 1 death for every 1 000 live births  she said the Government was working to create better conditions for gender equality  including programmes such as protection of motherhood  equal salary and the elimination of violence against women.  Stressing that Belarus had experienced a weakening of traditional families and increasing youth crime  the Government had taken extra steps to get men involved in paternal responsibilities and household work.  Concluding  she congratulated all women present in the committee  wishing them to live in a better world  as it was national “Mother’s Day” in Belarus.  SOMAIA BARGHOUTI  Permanent Observer  Mission of the State of Palestine  said gender equality should become a reality in which women would overcome all difficulties and challenges they faced in their struggles to achieve full advancement and empowerment.  Palestinian women had been living under the most unbearable and tragic conditions for far too long as a result of the continued Israeli military occupation and its oppressive policies and practices.  Turning to the situation in the occupied Gaza Strip  she underlined that Israeli occupying forces had slaughtered and wounded thousands of Palestinians  at least 2 150  among them more than 577 children and 261 women.  That reality  she said  had stifled Palestinian women’s efforts to implement their national strategic plans and programmes geared towards their empowerment and the international instruments and norms relating to women issues.  Concluding  she called upon the global community to address the current unjust and unsustainable situation in accordance with obligations and responsibilities under international law  including humanitarian and human rights law. AZZA HAMOOD ALI AL-BUSAIDI (Oman) said her Government had always encouraged women to be equal to men in all respects.  Oman had affirmed women’s rights to own property and promoted women’s education.  Women’s literacy had increased and birth rates had lowered significantly over the last thirty years.  The age of marriage had been increased and because of birth spacing  maternal mortality rates had dropped.  Turning to employment  she said that women had the right to 50 days of paid maternity leave and one year without pay. Every 17 October was the National Day of Women and prizes were given to women leaders.  In closing  she said Oman believed that protecting women meant protecting society as a whole. FAHAD MOHAMMED AL-KHAYARIN (Qatar) commended the pivotal role played by UN Women in coordinating international efforts to promote gender equality and said that the international community must make a concerted attempt to eliminate all forms of violence against women.  Qatar had achieved a socio-economic transformation in the field of women’s issues and was keen to apply the principle of gender equality in all areas.  Qatar had adopted a pre-emptive policy with regard to human rights and was pursuing an ambitious vision that would transform the country by 2030 to an advanced nation with a decent standard of living for women.  He emphasized the indivisible link between women and family.  Further  Qatar was concerned about women chafing under the yoke of occupation  such as in Palestine  who were deprived of basic rights to education  employment and freedom of movement. JISHENG XING (China) said 2015 marked the target year of the realization of the Millennium Development Goals and the twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action  prioritizing poverty reduction and the empowerment of women.  He noted that women’s participation in productive activities and social protection would enable their advancement  facilitating economic recovery and sharing development benefits.  Highlighting the importance of reflecting women’s needs  he said his Government was working to formulate policies that would strive to achieve the Millennium Goals. KAIRAT ABDRAKHMANOV (Kazakhstan) said the achievement of gender equality and women’s empowerment worldwide was closely linked to sustainable development  eradication of poverty  strengthening peace and security and the protection of human rights.  Being fully committed to achieving overall gender equality and promoting economic and social empowerment  Kazakhstan had actively advocated for the inclusion of a stand-alone goal on women’s empowerment in the post-2015 development agenda.  Further  he said  Kazakhstan’s 2050 Development Strategy had underscored the importance of promoting maternal health  economic empowerment of women and the extension of their social rights and capacities.  Extending his country’s appreciation and support for UN Women  he called on Member States to come forward to support the agenda for women through an approach that eliminates discrimination and marginalization. MARY ANN DANTUONO  Permanent Observer  Mission of the Holy See  said her delegation was alarmed over the impact of violence on women in conflicts  calling on the international community to make humanitarian aid accessible and to protect women and children from abuses and human trafficking.  “Rescuing women and girls from poverty is the key to their advancement and the best guarantee to achieve equality for them ” she stated.  Assuring women equal access to resources  capital and technology was the most concrete way of recognizing their contribution to society and assuring their advancement  she said. AMANDA ELLIS (New Zealand) said that her county had “diverse women facing diverse challenges”.  Indigenous women  Pacific women  Asian women  women with disabilities and migrant women faced unique challenges that required targeted approaches to ensure they had equal opportunities.  Therefore  the Government had launched Whanau Ora  an initiative driven by indigenous Maori values that aimed to provide health and social services to New Zealand families.  In the Pacific Islands region  the Government had supported projects to prevent domestic violence and increase the number of female parliamentarians.  Turning to Security Council resolution 1325  on women  peace and security  she lamented that 15 years after its adoption  too few United Nations missions and United Nations-mandated peace agreements explicitly included the senior and direct participation of women in their leadership.  In closing  she said her country was also in favour of a stand-alone goal for women in the sustainable development goals. XAVIER LASSO MENDOZA (Ecuador) said that his country had established a new paradigm for development that prioritized human beings over capital.  His country promoted gender equality as a cross-cutting principle in various national strategies.  The Government had undertaken surveys on family relations and violence and was granting funds to women to encourage their economic autonomy.  Other measures included policies on remuneration for domestic work and the extension of social security coverage for domestic work.  In the last seven years  Ecuador had also encouraged women to participate in the Government.  An inter-sectoral national strategy on family planning was focusing on preventing teenage pregnancies and promoting sexual and reproductive health  among other things. MARCELO ELISEO SCAPPINI RICCIARDI (Paraguay) said that the women in his country had played an unparalleled role in rebuilding after conflict.  However  they continued to be vulnerable  facing rampant discrimination and violence.  In order to transform that structural inequality  his Government had formulated three plans designed to implement policies that incorporate a gender component.  Paraguay was working to bring about a culture of equality by providing women with access to economic resources and labour  a life free from violence  a sustainable environment and opportunities for social and political participation.  As a result  participation of women in education and labour sectors had increased.  Regarding violence against women  he said that national laws had prohibited domestic violence  adding that public institutions had to provide preventive services and protection to women facing risks of violence. PAMELA GRACE LUNA TUDELA (Bolivia) said that her country had made great strides in the political participation of women.  Gender equality could only be achieved by questioning the patriarchal system that allowed for their subordination.  Therefore  post-2015 agenda goals and indicators should aim at removing structural inequalities between men and women.  A life free from discrimination and violence was the right of every woman and girl  she said.  Further  her Government had established a law that would give economic resources to women.  Despite the important progress in recent years  huge challenges remained.  In light of the discussion taking place on sustainable development  it was vital to ensure that women were part of an inclusive development process. RY TUY (Cambodia) said programmes had been developed to provide women with expanded opportunities  including developing their professional skills and knowledge capacity according to labour market requirements and easing their access to small- and medium-sized enterprise credit.  On the legal protection of women  the Government had adopted specific legislation to protect them from violence  trafficking and sexual harassment.  Other policies had aimed at increasing educational opportunities for female students through increased scholarships  additional training programmes  accommodation  safe transportation and increasing the number of female students. PAULINA FRANCESCHI (Panama) said  despite the recognized advancement of women  many still faced violence and discrimination.  With a view to improve the quality of life of women  legal tools to promote their rights had been developed and adopted  she added.  For example  changes in the criminal code included preventive measures  a definition of feminicide and changes that made violence against women punishable by law.  The major challenge was a lack of greater allocations of technical and financial resources to deal with the implementation  she concluded.  KOKI MULI GRIGNON (Kenya) said her Government had established legislative and policy measures to address women’s under-representation in public positions.  On violence against women  she said that measures had been taken to improve access to justice  including through the elimination of court fees for instituting proceedings that claim the infringement of rights or fundamental freedoms on behalf of women and girls.  Aiming at eradicating poverty and improving the economic status of women  a special fund had been created to disburse essential capital to finance business opportunities for women in remote areas. USMAN SARKI (Nigeria) said women could add value to every aspect of social interaction as skilled negotiators  credible community leaders  business entrepreneurs and problem solvers.  Turning to women’s political participation  he noted the need to build the capacity of female candidates in elections  which should begin in homes  classrooms and faith-based forums.  On fistula  he said efforts that included counselling and rehabilitation for women and girls  providing credit facilities to boost income-generating activities and promote vocational skills training had enabled a number of vulnerable groups of women to live independent and meaningful lives. RAHAMTALLA MOHAMED OSMAN ELNOR (Sudan) said that his Government had been taking many active steps to promote women’s advancement.  A law to combat violence against women had been established in 2003 and high-level mechanisms were being created under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice to protect women.  A regional conference on human trafficking would be held next year  he said.  Adding that the Government had established a detailed work plan and various departments within various ministries were formulating plans to improve women’s rights in different sectors  he said there were also special campaigns for women in the rural sector and microcredit programmes.  Climate change had led to certain setbacks in the advancement of women  he said.  In closing  he said Sudan called on the international community to take into account the problems of least developed countries as they made efforts to achieve gender equality. FOROUZANDEH VADIATI (Iran) said that the Beijing+20 process was a unique opportunity to acknowledge achievements  review lessons learned and tackle remaining and emerging challenges.  Based on the United Nations Human Development Index  Iranian women and girls had made outstanding progress in education  research  science  entrepreneurship  employment and sanitation despite the existence of severe and unprecedented unilateral sanctions against the nation.  Further  the outbreak of violent extremism presented an imminent threat to the life and rights of women and girls in the region.  It was alarming to observe women and girls from the West joining extremist groups  she said.  Iran also strongly condemned the explicit targeting of women and children from religious minorities  including Christian and Yazidi women. GEIR PEDERSEN (Norway) said recent increases in violent extremism continued to have devastating consequences for women and girls in affected countries.  “If one schoolgirl can take on the Taliban ” he said  “then  surely  the world community can defeat extremism and terrorism.”  Indeed  educating girls was key to achieve gender equality  sustainable development and eradicating poverty.   Young people needed knowledge and skills to make informed decisions about their lives  including sexual education  he concluded.  GEORGINA MSEMO (United Republic of Tanzania) said a new constitution was being drafted  which included a section that acknowledged women’s rights in a number of areas  including access to and owning land and maternity protection.  It also gave widows rights to inherit property and protected women from gender-based violence.  On female genital mutilation  she said the reasons why the practice had prevailed included illiteracy  poverty and social pressure.  To tackle that issue  educational programmes and mobilization initiatives involving schools  communities  religious institutions and the media had been developed  as well as the direct engagement and mobilization of communities  including girls and boys. MAYA DAGHER (Lebanon) said that her country welcomed the inclusion of a stand-alone goal on women in the post-2015 development agenda and reiterated the importance of mainstreaming gender into all other goals.  It was outrageous to see that women and girls were often easy victims for abuse and sexual violence as a weapon of war.  Lebanon reaffirmed its support for Security Council resolution 1325 and other subsequent resolutions on women  peace and security.  Last April  after more than three years of deliberation  the Lebanese Parliament had passed a law on the protection of women and other family members from domestic violence.  The law provided for the establishment of temporary shelters for the survivors of abuse  the assignment of a public prosecutor in each governorate to investigate domestic violence and the establishment of specialized family units within the Internal Security Forces to process complaints.  She concluded by calling on the international community to share Lebanon’s burden as a country that was hosting more than 1.3 million Syrian refugees  most of whom were women and children. NICOLE ROMULUS (Haiti) said women made up 52 per cent of her country’s population and progress had been made in achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment  including the achievement of gender parity in primary and secondary education.  Turning to women in the labour market  she noted that 60 per cent worked in informal sector.  She also noted their high quality of work in electronic device assembly and the clothing sector.  Social programmes had been developed to improve their living conditions  including revising the education sector and providing food aid and transport.  To reduce the gender gap in political representation  an amendment to the constitution allocated 30 per cent of public posts to women with the aim of increasing their participation in decision-making roles.  RUBÉN IGNACIO ZAMORA RIVAS (El Salvador) said that 35 per cent of women worldwide had suffered from domestic  physical and sexual violence  calling for a systematic approach when tackling violence against women.  Specifically  he addressed violence against indigenous and older women  asking the international community not to neglect the needs of women after menopause.  Turning to Security Council resolution 1325  he said that as a country that had suffered long years of conflict  he confirmed the importance of women in settling conflicts and promoting peace. INTISAR NASSER MOHAMMED ABDULLAH (Yemen) said her country was sparing no efforts to reinforce the rights of women.  Yemen was among the first countries to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  The Government had established a national strategy for the advancement of women  focusing on six objectives  including education  health and eliminating violence against them.  Yemen was currently redefining the responsibilities of the state and private sector.  She said a transitional process that had started in 2011 had shown increasing participation by women.  Further  30 per cent of the electoral lists were reserved for women and the Government established the minimum marriage age as 18.  In conclusion  she emphasized the suffering of women in Palestine living under Israeli occupation.  The international community must put an end to the occupation and allow the Palestinian women to live in peace  she implored. YIĞIT CANAY (Turkey) said that the failure to recognize the rights of women had led to gender-based violence and no country was immune from that.  Turkey had carried out extensive legislative work to combat violence against women  including the establishment of centres to provide services to victims.  The country was also addressing other issues  such as early marriage and dowries.  Turkey acknowledged the role of grassroots organizations in strengthening the scope of the legislative framework.  Women’s shelters were an important mechanism in Turkey for the protection of women.  A free  equal and prosperous world required the empowerment of women  he said.  Responding to allegations by another Member State  he added that Turkey had been a safe refuge for thousands of fleeing Syrians.  Turkey had given Syrian women and girls an open welcome  he said  adding that allegations suggesting otherwise were attempts to divert attention from the destruction in that country. AMJAD MOHAMMAD SALEH AL-MOUMANI (Jordan) said that when a woman was empowered  she could participate in setting policy and decision-making in all spheres of life.  A dedicated national strategy had been developed  he continued.  It had aimed at gender equality and women’s empowerment  resulting in improving the participation of women in public sectors.  Providing an overview of achievements  he said that there were 18 female members of parliament and women voters comprised 48 per cent of election rolls.  In the private sector  he added  women accounted for 14 per cent of the total labour force and 20 per cent in non-governmental organizations (NGOs). DAVID BEYI (Burkina Faso) said that “educating a woman is educating a nation”  especially in those countries where women counted for more than half of the population.  Regarding violence against women  he said that human trafficking  female genital mutilation and early and forced marriage constituted flagrant violations of their human rights.  At the national level  he continued  female genital mutilation modules had been integrated within teaching materials and hotlines had been set up to report incidents.  “Eliminating gender inequality is a requisite to achieving the Millennium Development Goals ” he added. MASNI ERIZA (Indonesia) said “the advancement of women is the advancement of humanity”  yet the structured marginalization that persisted had kept them in poverty  exposing them to inequality  violence and even death.  At the national level  legal and policy frameworks had been set up and law enforcement officers were taking part in training and capacity-building to support or assist victims of violence.  On preventative measures  he added  aside from incorporating gender and human rights issues into educational curricula and organizing national awareness-raising campaigns on violence against women  the Government also worked with civil society  media and women’s organizations to sensitize the public about gender issues concerning families and communities.  LAURIA NGUELE MAKOUELET (Congo) said that despite intensified efforts to achieve gender equality  the status of women continued to be low.  For its part  the Government was increasingly aware of the gaps limiting her country from providing equal opportunities that match the potential of women.  Aware of its international commitments  the Government had strengthened efforts  including improving women’s social  political and cultural status and protecting the family.  Other strategies included microfinance programmes  accelerated literacy initiatives and targeted training.  Female genital mutilation was not a Congolese custom  she said  but it was a widespread practice among foreign communities in her country.  The practice had been outlawed and a zero tolerance campaign had been launched  she said  adding that the legal aspects were being complemented by outreach efforts in partnership with civil society organizations. JEANNE D’ARC BYAJE (Rwanda) said the advancement of women was a key factor in the realization of human rights and social and economic development.  Rwanda strongly believed that women were not just a strong asset to rely on in ensuring the future of the country  but were also key drivers of sustainable development.  Noting that in the immediate aftermath of the genocide  women and girls made up 70 per cent of the population  she said women had to assume the roles of community leaders  financial providers and heads of households.  Further  she underlined  “Rwanda is not interested in having Rwandan women but quality Rwandan women”  as they were instrumental in improving social and economic status of women. FERNANDO JORGE WAHNON FERREIRA (Cabo Verde) said gender equality was a moral obligation and no country could claim to develop peace and development without achieving it.  The constitution recognized all citizens as equal  irrespective of their gender  and the family code stipulated that women and men had the same responsibility for running the family and caring for the children  he continued.  On sexual and reproductive rights  a maternal protection programme had been developed to reduce maternal mortality  as well as to allow access to family planning.  Despite the progress made  there was a need for greater presence of women in the country’s political life  he added.   DRAGANA ANĐELIĆ (Bosnia and Herzegovina) said that the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was the first legal instrument to address issues related to gender equality and women’s empowerment and called for its universal ratification.  She also called for a stand-alone goal on those issues in the post-2015 development agenda.  On women  peace and security  she said that the mobilization of men was essential to prevent violence in conflict.  Involving women in conflict prevention and peacekeeping operations was also central  she added  as shown by the participation of her country’s female police officers in United Nations peacekeeping missions  who had  among other things  contributed to peacebuilding and protection of civilians.  CRISTIÁN BARROS MELET (Chile) said that more than a decade into the twenty-first century gender equality was still in the distance.  The drawing up of the post-2015 sustainable development goals was an opportunity to ensure that the empowerment of women was highlighted.  Lauding UN Women as an effective tool to fight against gender inequality  he added that the international community had a valuable opportunity and responsibility to do things differently.  Chile had joined other countries in recognizing the achievement of Malala Yousafzai in winning the Nobel Peace Prize and applauded her strength and courage.  For its part  his Government was designing a national plan to tackle gender violence that would be implemented by 2015.  The Chilean Parliament had established a ministry for women and gender equity  thereby creating a national mechanism with authority to design  coordinate and evaluate gender empowerment policies. MATEO ESTREME (Argentina) said that integrating a gender perspective was key to achieving social transformation.  “If we really want to achieve women’s empowerment ” he stressed  “we cannot afford to simply debate every year using the same words used twenty years ago.”  It was necessary to reflect on the problems faced by women today and build on lessons learned over the years.  In his country  various ministries were working together to coordinate efforts to tackle violence against women.  Argentina was also working regionally and internationally with partners. In closing  he lamented that in the 15 years since the Millennium Declaration  no country had been able to achieve full gender equality. Right of Reply A representative of Israel  speaking in exercise of the right of reply  said while other speakers had been professional and spoke about the status of women  the representative of the State of Palestine had preferred to ignore the real reasons and to attack Israel.  “Religious extremism was the real reason for the low status of women” in Palestine  he said.  For 50 days during the recent conflict  he said women and children in Israel had been subjected to a rocket barrage from the Palestinian side.  In closing  he said it was unfortunate that the Palestinian Authority supported the terrorist attacks of Hamas against Israel. Also speaking in exercise of the right of reply  an observer for the State of Palestine said that she would not respond to the distortion and lies in the words of the delegate of Israel.  Instead she wished to bring the Committee’s attention to the Secretary-General’s press release today  made after visiting Gaza and seeing the destruction caused by Israel.  Quoting the press release  she read  “The enormous destruction of Gaza is a source of pain to me personally and a shame to the international community.”  Israel was not a normal state  it was an occupying power  she concluded. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-14,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gapal1314.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The youth of the United States were driving a change across the country that could  in the long term  alter its foreign policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  said Noam Chomsky  international public intellectual and Professor Emeritus of Linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  today during a lecture to the United Nations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. He recalled that 45 years ago Israeli diplomat Abba Eban had suggested that Jews who criticized Israel should be treated for psychiatric disorders.  Today  criticizing Israel was not a form of anti-Semitism  said Mr. Chomsky  but rather being “critical of a country engaged in a criminal act”. He said that while many of the world’s problems were intractable  the Israeli and Palestinian issue was not.  The general outlines of a diplomatic solution had been presented clearly in a January 1976 Security Council resolution calling for a two-State settlement along internationally recognized borders.  The United States had vetoed that text  setting the pattern that had continued ever since  with the most recent United States veto in February 2011. Hamas had won free and fair elections  he said  and in response  the United States had decided to punish Palestinians for voting the wrong way.  Turning to the situation in Gaza  he noted that in August 2013 a ceasefire was reached between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.  There was a pattern of ceasefires reached which Israel had disregarded while continuing its assault on Gaza and building more settlements in the West Bank.  Hamas would observe the ceasefire until an Israeli escalation elicited a Hamas response  which led to another exercise in “mowing the lawn” in Israeli parlance. The removal of Israeli settlers from Gaza was depicted as a noble effort  but reality was different  he said.  He quoted an Israeli official who had told the Israeli press that the goal of disengagement was freezing of the peace process to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian State and ensure that diplomacy was removed from the agenda.  The reality on the ground  however  was that the “ruined territory” was not released for a single day from Israel’s military grip.  While the Oslo accords reached 20 years ago had established that Gaza and the West Bank were indivisible territory whose unity and integrity could not be broken up  the United States and Israel were dedicated to separating them. Unity between Gaza and the West Bank threatened the policy of separating the two  and also undermined the pretext for Israel to refuse to negotiate  he said.  Israel had launched assaults on Palestinians in the West Bank  targeting Hamas  with the pretext that three Israeli teenagers had been brutally murdered.  Going over details of who was actually responsible for the deed  he noted that the pattern was very clear:  the latest ceasefire had been reached on 26 August and had been followed by Israel’s land grab. Little had changed in the last 47 years  he said  apart from the scale of crimes  which continued without a break with constant United States support.  There was a conventional picture repeated on all sides  which was that there were two alternatives  either a two-State settlement which represented international consensus  or a one-State solution  with Israel taking over the West Bank and the Palestinians “handing over keys”. His own opinion was that those were not the two alternatives.  The real alternatives were either an international consensus on a January 1976 agreement  and the other more realistic option was Israel continuing exactly what it was doing  with United States support.  What was happening was not a secret:  Israel was taking over what it called Jerusalem  which was actually five times greater than historic Jerusalem and included many Arab villages.  Looking at the map  those corridors broke up the West Bank into cantons.  What was left was uninhabitable desert. Analogies were often made to the situation in apartheid-era South Africa  but that was misleading  as South Africa had relied on its black workforce  he said.  Israel had no such attitude towards the Palestinians.  “If they leave  or die  that’s fine ” he said.  That was the realistic alternative to a two-State settlement  and it would continue as long as the United States supported it. Riyad Mansour  Permanent Observer for the State of Palestine  said that he agreed with Mr. Chomsky’s thoughts on United States policy  but noted that it was not just the Israelis and Americans dictating policy.  The Palestinian people were determined to continue the struggle.  “Our people are dead determined that we do not want to stay in Bantustans in apartheid-style ” he said.  The Palestinians were key players despite the odds being against them. Putting Palestine on the geopolitical map was an accomplishment  he said.  In 1988  the struggle of the Palestinian people had succeeded in unifying different parts of their homeland.  The tragic split between Gaza and the West Bank was “a huge setback”.  The April 2014 agreement that put an end to the split and established a national consensus Government was a historic step.  Giving further details on the issue of unity between Gaza and the West Bank  he noted that there were “no boy scouts in this business in this chamber”.  Gaza had to be rebuilt  and freedom and dignity had to be attained.  Addressing Mr. Chomsky  he called him a “superstar”  and termed today’s meeting “the pulse of justice”. Fode Seck  (Senegal) Chair of the Committee for the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People  opened today’s special meeting held as part of the International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.  He encouraged the audience to visit the International Year of Solidarity Twitter page  to tweet during the talk with #2014forPalestine  and to visit the Committee’s Facebook page. Amy Goodman  Host and Executive Producer of Democracy Now  moderated the ensuing question-and-answer period with representatives of Member States  non-governmental organizations and media outlets.  She started out by asking Mr. Chomsky what he thought was the single most important action the United Nations could take to solve the crisis.  He answered that the United Nations would act insofar as the great Powers permitted it to act  primarily the United States  the United Kingdom and France. But there were things the Organization could do  such as recognizing the State of Palestine  he said  noting that 138 members took that step in the General Assembly in November 2012 and parties of the Swedish and British parliaments had recently voted in favour of doing the same.  The Swedish vote had “broken the logjam for the West”.  While the British vote had not been a Government decision  it reflected a shift in understanding and attitudes and could lead to a viable two-State settlement. Moreover  the European Union had produced a directive forbidding its members from funding or participating in any projects located within illegal Israeli settlements  he said.  Major church groups in the United States had taken similar positions against multinational companies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory  and there were efforts against securities firms operating there. Regarding the Boycott  Divestment and Sanctions Movement  he said that although the Movement had been a positive impetus  it had been unwilling to face crucial questions  such as what would help the victims and what would harm them.   The Movement’s actions directed against the Israeli occupation had been largely successful  but its insistence that they be continued until Israel had allowed Palestinian refugees to return had only led to a backlash. On what the United States should do  he said that country should have been called upon by its own citizens to conform to its own laws  such as the Leahy Law  which barred sending weapons to any military units involved in consistent rights violations.  There wasn’t any doubt that the Israeli army was involved in such violations.  He also criticized the United States Government for allowing tax-exempt United States organizations to carry out activities on the West Bank. Asked what he would do to solve the conflict if he were President of the Palestinian Authority  Mr. Chomsky cited the need to overcome the split between Gaza and the West Bank and to maintain the Unity Government amid the attacks from many sides.  It was a theme familiar to many of the countries at the United Nations who had undergone national struggles.  Palestine had been one of the remaining two colonies  along with Western Sahara  that had not been decolonized.  Also there was a need to reach out to international opinion. Asked about the prospect of a peaceful two-State solution occurring in the coming decades and what progressive forces should do  Mr. Chomsky said the effort to achieve the two-State solution was by no means finished and the United States could settle it.  But the solution would not necessarily be a good settlement.  Natural cultural and commercial connections should develop across the artificial boundary  leading to the kind of integration that would come from both sides. Asked why the United States had always unconditionally supported Israel  Mr. Chomsky said that long ago when the United States  Australia and Canada  all settler-colonial societies  were the greatest supporters of Israel  they were driven by religious principles.  Significant geostrategic factors also figured into the mix.  In the latest escalation  Israel began to run out of munitions  and the United States provided munitions that had been pre-positioned in Israel for United States use. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-14,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gal3480.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Divergent views on the nature of its role and agenda emerged today  as the Sixth Committee (Legal) took up the work of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization. Introducing its report  Marcel Van Den Bogaard  Chair of the Special Committee  gave an overview of that body’s tasks  as mandated to it by the General Assembly.  Member States’ proposals and discussions touched on topics such as strengthening the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security  and requesting an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences of using force by States without prior authorization by the Security Council  as well as the issue of assistance to third States affected by sanctions. While sanctions remained an important instrument for the maintenance of peace and security  a representative of the European Union Delegation noted that neither the General Assembly nor the Security Council had found it necessary to take any action to assist third States affected by sanctions.  Furthermore  no State had appealed for relief.  The topic should be removed from the Special Committee’s agenda. However  Algeria’s representative said the Special Committee should continue its consideration of the matter  a view echoed by other delegations.  Costa Rica’s representative  speaking for the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  stressed that just because no State had yet requested that kind of assistance  that did not justify removing the issue from the Special Committee’s agenda. Several delegations said there were certain proposals that would not add value to the Special Committee’s work or to the United Nations.  As well  there was a need to prioritize issues so as to avoid duplication of work being done in other bodies.  Some representatives also suggested examining the duration and frequency of the Committee’s meetings  with the United States’ delegate adding that stagnant items on the agenda should be scrutinized in order to keep the Special Committee relevant and potentially useful. On the contrary  various speakers highlighted the critical role of the Committee  with Cuba’s representative pointing out that approval of worthwhile documents  which would have strengthened the Organization’s work  had not been possible due to developed States constantly impeding such efforts. Likewise  El Salvador’s representative pointed out that as the Charter was the founding and guiding document of the Organization  it was important to support the work of the Special Committee. George Korontzis  Director of the Codification Division  also gave an overview of the status of the Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs  stating that from among the 50 volumes of which the publication as a whole should consist  42 volumes had been completed. Gregor Boventor  Chief of the Security Council Practices and Charter Research Branch of the Department of Political Affairs  in his briefing to the Committee  said that due to efficiency-enhancing initiatives undertaken  the Branch continued to make good progress in updating the Repertoire of the Practice of the Security Council and in preparing and completing several supplements to it. The Committee today also heard four requests for observer status in the General Assembly  to which it would revert at a later date. Also speaking on the Special Committee were representatives of Iran (speaking also for the Non-Aligned Movement)  South Africa (speaking for the African Group)  Sudan  Nicaragua  Russian Federation  Malaysia  Ghana  Libya  Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  India  Syrian Arab Republic  Morocco  China  Nigeria  and Tunisia. Speaking in exercise of the right of reply were delegates from the Republic of Korea and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Speaking on requests for observer status in the General Assembly were representatives of Turkey  Cyprus  Armenia  Azerbaijan  Kyrgyzstan  Russian Federation  France  Argentina  Cuba  Pakistan  Malaysia  Nigeria  Fiji and United States. Speaking in exercise of the right of reply on granting observer status in the General Assembly were representatives of Armenia and Cyprus. The Committee will meet at 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday  15 October to consider universal jurisdiction. Background The Sixth Committee met today to take up consideration of the Report of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization (document A/69/33). Further to that  it also had before it the report of the Secretary-General on the Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs and Repertoire of the Practice of the Security Council (document A/69/159) and the report of the Secretary-General on the Implementation of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations related to assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions (document A/69/119). It would also consider four requests for observer status in the work of the General Assembly  which include Observer status for the Cooperation Council of Turkic-speaking States in the General Assembly (documents A/66/141 and A/C.6/69/L.4); Observer status for the International Chamber of Commerce in the General Assembly (documents A/67/191); Observer Status for the Developing Eight Countries Organization for Economic Cooperation in the General Assembly (documents A/69/142 and A/C.6/69/L.2); and Observer status for the Pacific Community in the General Assembly (documents A/69/143 and A/C.6/69/L.3). Introduction of Reports MARCEL VAN DEN BOGAARD (Netherlands)  Chairman of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on Strengthening the Role of the Organization  introduced the Special Committee’s report.  In February of this year  it had met to continue its deliberations on the questions assigned to it by the General Assembly.  In particular  it focused on all proposals concerning the maintenance of international peace and security  the implementation of assistance to third States affected by sanctions  the peaceful settlement of disputes among States and  among others  ways in which working methods could be improved to enhance efficiency and utilization of resources. He then noted the topic of each chapter of the Report  pointing out that the first was entirely procedural.  Chapter II included the Commission’s work related to several States’ contributions  including the revised proposal by Libya regarding strengthening the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security; Venezuela’s further revised working paper on the proper implementation of the Charter; Belarus and the Russian Federation’s working paper requesting an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences of the resort to the use of force by States without prior authorization by the Security Council; and Cuba’s working paper on the strengthening the role of the Organization and enhancing its effectiveness. On the peaceful settlement of disputes  he said  Chapter III included a summary of discussions on the Russian Federation’s proposals to establish a website dedicated to the topic and update the 1992 Handbook on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes between States.  Chapter IV included discussions on the Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs and the Repertoire of the Practice of the Security Council.  The Special Committee had been briefed by the Secretariat on the status of the same  and recommendations agreed upon were included therein.  Chapter V focused on the consideration of the other items on the agenda and the identification of new subjects  including Ghana’s proposal to include an item regarding principles and practical measures for strengthening cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations in the maintenance of peace and security. GEORGE KORONTZIS  Director  Codification Division  giving an overview of the status of the Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs  said that from among the 50 volumes of which the publication as a whole should consist  42 volumes had been completed.  Twenty-eight of them were published and 14 finalized and submitted for translation and publication.  Further  studies from 42 complete volumes  including the 14 volumes being processed for publication  were available on the United Nations website for the Repertory. As well  he continued  advance versions of several studies on individual articles for volume III of supplements 7  8 and 9  and a number of studies for supplement 10  which had been finalized  were also on the website.  The electronic version of the Repertory included a full-text search feature  which provided users the opportunity to search all studies simultaneously for any word or word combination in the three languages of publication  English  French and Spanish. Collaboration with Columbia University Law School  now in its eleventh year  was continuing  as well as with the University of Ottawa  Faculty of Law  now in its fourth  he said.  Regarding funding  a note verbale had been sent to all permanent missions reminding them of the possibility of making voluntary contributions to the trust fund  and inviting them to raise the question with private institutions and individuals who might wish to assist.  Since the last report  having received contributions from Finland and Turkey  the total balance of the Fund was $26 152.  He called upon Member States to contribute to the Fund. GREGOR BOVENTOR  Chief of the Security Council Practices and Charter Research Branch of the Department of Political Affairs  said that due to efficiency-enhancing initiatives it had undertaken  the Branch continued to make good progress in the updating of the Repertoire of the Practice of the Security Council and in preparing and completing several supplements to it.  During the past year  it had continued to respond to requests for information from Member States  United Nations staff  students  academic scholars and researchers on questions relating to the Council’s practice.  As well  it was continuing to work on improvements to the website’s search function to allow for more intuitive use.  It had also continued addressing the backlog in preparation of volume III of the Repertory by submitting all studies on various Charter Articles for 2000 to 2009.  He expressed gratitude for China’s and Turkey’s contributions to the trust fund for updating of the Repertoire  and to Switzerland for its sponsorship of an associate expert.  Noting the heavy workload and the need to prevent new backlogs  he encouraged all Member States to support the Branch in its endeavours. Statements on the Special Committee on the Charter GHOLAMHOSSEIN DEHGHANI (Iran)  speaking for the Non-Aligned Movement  said that the Special Committee should play a key role in the reform process of the United Nations  notably the democratization of its principal organs and respect for the General Assembly’s role and authority  including questions related to international peace and security.  He expressed concern at the Security Council’s encroachment on the functions and powers of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council  underscoring that it was important for the Special Committee to study the legal nature of the implementation of Chapter IV of the Charter  particularly those Articles dealing with the functions and powers of the General Assembly. On Security-Council imposed sanctions  he said that they should only be imposed where there was a threat to international peace and security  or an act of aggression.  Furthermore  their regimes should be clearly defined  based on tenable legal grounds  should have a specified timeframe  and be lifted once the objectives were achieved.  In that regard  he expressed the hope that the Council would use the Annex to General Assembly resolution A/64/115 on “Introduction and implementation of sanctions imposed by the United Nations” as a reference guide.  He noted with concern the backlog in the preparation of volume III of the Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs  and called upon the Secretary-General to address the issue as a priority. KINGSLEY MAMABOLO (South Africa)  speaking for the African Group  said that the Special Committee had not lived up to its potential role in the Organization due to the tendency to allow ideological battles prevent performance of its functions  namely legal analysis.  Turning to the proposal submitted by Ghana on how to strengthen cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations  he said that the Special Committee could make a meaningful contribution in that area that would help to overcome those ideological impediments. “[T]he Organization cannot demand of its Members to adhere to the rule of law while itself makes no attempt to demonstrate or reflect this important principle ” he stated  emphasizing that the Special Committee’s work should be primarily directed at ensuring the Organization lived up to the goals of rule of law and justice.  That could protect the Organization from being labelled hypocritical.  As the premier organ mandated to ensure peace  security and stability in the world  the Security Council must address the challenges within itself.  Maintaining the status quo would only further erode its credibility and legitimacy  and weaken the Organization. GEORGINA GUILLÉN-GRILLO (Costa Rica)  speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  reiterated the obligation to peacefully settle disputes  and recalled that the Charter provided the framework for that obligation.  Sanctions must be imposed and applied in conformity with the Charter and international law.  It was necessary to consider the question of the application of the Charter’s provisions on the assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions  pointing out that while no State had yet requested that kind of assistance  it did not entail that the issue should be discontinued from the Special Committee’s agenda. She recognized the Secretariat’s work in updating the Repertory and the Repertoire  the progress made in addressing the backlog of the Repertory  as well as Member States’ contributions to the trust fund.  Reaffirming CELAC’s commitment to the Special Committee’s work  she recalled the introduction of a working paper by Venezuela.  Noting the modest concrete results produced in the Special Committee’s last sessions  she said better approaches must be adopted to enhance the efficiency of its work.  Member States should consider options in that endeavour. GILLES MARHIC  European Union Delegation  said that sanctions remained an important instrument under the Charter for the maintenance of peace and security.  Security Council practice had shown that they could be designed so as to minimize adverse consequences to civilian populations.  Noting that neither the General Assembly nor the Security Council had found it necessary to take any action relating to assistance to third States affected by sanctions  nor had any State so affected appealed for relief  the question of assistance to third States affected by sanctions should be removed from the Special Committee’s agenda. He also said that establishing a website dedicated to the peaceful settlement of disputes and updating the Handbook on the matter of 1992 would not add value  and called for proper prioritization of Secretariat resources so as to avoid duplication of efforts.  The 2006 decision on reforming the working methods of the Special Committee should be implemented.  Consideration should be given to whether items should remain on the agenda before examining proposals for new items.  Another option was to re-examine the duration and frequency of the Committee’s meetings.  Calling for continued efforts towards updating the Repertory and the Repertoire and making them available electronically in all language versions  he also encouraged Member States to contribute to the trust fund for the elimination of the backlog. Mr. ALNOR (Sudan) said the Special Committee had a unique role in the reform of the Organization.  The General Assembly and all its subsidiary organs  as the most representative of all United Nations bodies  was most qualified to address the issues on the Organization’s agenda.  The Security Council had transgressed on the functions of the Assembly and the Economic and Social Council.  Balance must be restored.  The Council must be more just  democratic and less politicized.  The unilateral imposition of sanctions in pursuit of narrow political goals violated the Charter and had been condemned by most Member States.  He urged those countries imposing such sanctions to refrain from doing so  and to use peaceful means to settle conflicts.  Noting that the African Union had consistently found African solutions to African problems  he said that the Organization should give greater importance to cooperation with regional organizations.  In that context  he urged consideration to Ghana’s proposal on the matter. JUANA SANDOVAL (Nicaragua)  associating herself with the Non-Aligned Movement and CELAC  said that work assigned to the Charter Committee was key to the proper evolution and process of the Organization’s reform.  However  it was of concern that the Security Council gave itself power to discuss topics in the purview of the General Assembly  which was mandated to discuss issues as provided by the Charter.  She rejected the application of any unilateral measures or sanctions and the selective application of international law  stressing that those practices challenged the principles of the Charter and international law.  The peaceful settlement of disputes should remain on the Charter Committee’s agenda  she said  stating her support for the proposal by Belarus and the Russian Federation to request the opinion of the International Court of Justice regarding the use of force by States without proper authorization by the Security Council.  She also expressed support for Cuba’s paper on strengthening the role of the Organization and effectiveness  as well as Venezuela’s paper on the study of the proper implementation of the Charter with regard to the functional relationships of its bodies.  She joined other delegations in calling for a detailed discussion of various proposals on the Committee agenda  as well as new proposals that would benefit from a broad debate. MAXIM V. MUSIKHIN (Russian Federation) noted that past proposals had called for the Special Committee’s work schedule to be increased  as well as to make it a dormant body that would only be called upon as needed.  However  the Special Committee  which contributed to ensuring the rule of law  should continue working on a standing basis  and its capacity not be weakened.  Among the many important items on its agenda was the peaceful resolution of disputes between States  and he proposed republication of the Committee’s publication on the matter  and uploading a website that would present other documents on the matter as well.  Expressing appreciation for the Repertory and the Repertoire  he said that regarding the latter  the Secretariat should stick to the clear rules and standards in drafting that Repertoire  contained in the report of the Secretary-General from 18 October 1952. TANIERIS DIEGUEZ LAO (Cuba)  associating herself with the Non-Aligned Movement and CELAC  said that approval of worthwhile documents  which would have strengthened the Organization’s work  had not been possible  as was seen with the Russian Federation’s proposal.  The Secretariat could better organize the Special Committee’s work by providing greater space for consideration of proposals  so that there was a clear record of positions undertaken by various Member States.  Proposals should be discussed in paragraph basis as done in other spaces.  Work of the Special Committee was constantly impeded by developed States who wished to see it abolished  or see its work reduced to a minimum.  While they claimed that the Committee did not achieve concrete results  it was they who refused to discuss substantive proposals and allege a simple disagreement without arguing their stance.  The Special Committee needed to work  not analyse its work.  She expressed support for the Special Committee’s current agenda and thanked several delegations for their contributions through concrete proposals.  Recalling her country’s proposal regarding maintaining peace and international security and a new proposal concerning the peaceful settlement of disputes  she invited all interested parties to present their comments. MOHAMED SLALH EDDINE BELAID (Algeria)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  highlighted the important role of the Special Committee in the peaceful settlement of international disputes.  He reaffirmed the provisions of the Manila Declaration and considered relevant all proposals and working papers submitted by Venezuela  Belarus  Russia  Cuba  Libya  and Ghana.  The Special Committee should also continue considering the question of assistance to third States affected by sanctions  noting further that sanctions should only be applied as a last resort.  The timeframe for lifting sanctions and the possibility of including a sunset clause was of “utmost importance”.  Emphasizing the need to fully respect the Charter  he stressed the importance of maintaining balance between the General Assembly and the Security Council  and voiced support for an Open-ended working group to study the proper implementation of the Charter  particularly with regard to that relationship. JOHN ARBOGAST (United States) said that there was much-needed rationalization of the Special Committee’s work.  Stagnant items on the agenda should be scrutinized by sponsors and members alike  with a view towards keeping the Charter Committee relevant and potentially useful.  The Committee should remain focused on ways to improve its efficiency and productivity  including by considering biennial meetings and/or shortened sessions.  Also  it should not pursue activities in the area of international peace and security that would be duplicative or inconsistent with the roles of the United Nations principal organs  such as the consideration of a further revised working paper calling for a working group to study the implementation of the Charter with respect to the functional relationship of its organs.  The Special Committee should decide that third State-related sanctions no longer issue merited discussion.  His delegation did not support the proposal to request the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion on the use of force  and remained cautious about adding new items to the Committee’s agenda.  The proposals concerning updating the 1992 Handbook and establishing a website dedicated to the peaceful settlement of disputes would be labour-intensive exercises that would not add much value given the wealth of already available websites and online tools. RUBÉN ZAMORA (El Salvador) said that as the Charter was the founding and guiding document of the Organization  it was important to support the work of the Special Committee.  Furthermore  the application for assistance by third parties affected by sanctions should remain on the agenda.  Regarding the Special Committee’s working methods  he said substantive changes were needed.  He also expressed particular interest in determining new topics for the Committee  as long as they were in keeping with the Sixth Committee’s mandate  so as to avoid duplication of efforts with other bodies. HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  expressed concern about the impact of the application of sanctions  noting that they were an ineffective way to punish intended targets  and often brought collateral damage towards innocent people of a State.  Further  sanctions should be used only as a last resort and not considered for preventive measures.  In that regard  he noted the Security Council’s improvements in shifting from comprehensive economic sanctions to targeted sanctions.  He voiced support for the proposal to have the Special Committee study the proper implementation of the Charter with respect to the functional relationship of its organs  in order to retain the Assembly’s role as the Organization’s main policy-making and representative organ.  Noting the continuing trend of encroachment of the Security Council into functions and powers that fell within the competence of other United Nations organs  he asked that principal organs of the United Nations faithfully respect each other’s mandate in accordance with the Charter. AUDREY NAANA ABAYENA (Ghana)  associating herself with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  welcomed interest in her country’s proposal on strengthening the relationship between the Organization and sub-regional and regional groups.  Although Chapter VIII of the Charter explicitly prescribed a role for regional organizations  the guidelines and practices underpinning that partnership were not always consistent with the Charter.  Her country’s proposal aimed to arrive at clearer principles and practical measures that would promote better coordination and cooperation in such areas as regional security  preventive diplomacy  early warning systems  peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building.  Noting that her country had prepared a working paper on the matter  she welcomed input from other delegations. ESSA A. E. ESSA (Libya)  associating himself with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  said his country had submitted a revised paper on some principles concerning sanctions that had contributed to General Assembly resolution 64/115.  On the Repertoire and the Repertory  he welcomed progress in decreasing the backlog  and emphasized the importance in publishing those in other languages  including Arabic  so that concerned people could benefit from them.  Noting the Special Committee’s important role in the reorganization and reform of the Organization  he encouraged Member States to take measures to reinvigorate the United Nations’ main organs  especially towards strengthening the General Assembly’s role as the main policy-making organ for the maintenance of international peace and security  and the peaceful settlement of disputes. HOSSEIN GHARIBI (Iran)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  expressed support for the proposal of Belarus and the Russian Federation.  Further  he pointed out that sanctions could only be introduced as a last resort  when the Security Council had determined an actual threat to or breach of peace or act of aggression.  The International Court of Justice had made clear that no organ could be released from the treaty provisions of the Charter concerning limitations on its powers.  In that light  certain politically motivated determinations of such threats entailing political manipulation of the Council rendered that body accountable for the consequences of those sanctions  and States who had imposed such sanctions would bear the responsibility for the Organization’s internationally wrongful act. Targeted States should be entitled to damages. KIM YONG SONG (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) said acts contradicting the Charter still existed within activities of the United Nations.  Certain Member States continued to deal with important issues with political objectives and interests  particularly in the Security Council.  That was evident in the critical and dangerous situation on the Korean peninsula  created by the Security Council’s misconduct  where the vicious cycle of aggravating tension continued  and the danger of breaking peace was high.  The root cause of that situation rested with the United States’ hostile policy towards his country and “the US-south Korea joint military exercises”.  However  the Security Council had turned its back to his country’s repeated demands to address the issue of suspending such exercises  and instead had questioned the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s inevitable and defensive response.  Noting the unfairness and double standards of the Council  he called for its necessary reform.  The Special Committee should review whether the Council lived up to the Charter  and take appropriate measures.  Recalling that the United States illegally formed the “United Nations Command” in 1950 to evade its responsibility of provoking the Korean War and justifying its military intervention  he called on the United States to immediately dismantle the United Nations Command in accordance with the United Nations resolution adopted at the Assembly’s thirtieth session. KOTESWARA RAO (India) said that the Security Council  which mandated all sanctions  bore the responsibility for finding solutions to the problems of third States affected by their application as indicated in Article 50 of the Charter.  When applied in accordance with the Charter  they could serve as an important tool for maintaining peace and security  but should only be used as a last resort.  While targeted sanctions had reduced economic problems faced by third States  he said the Special Committee should continue its consideration of the matter to find a definitive solution.  He also expressed support for continuing the topic “Peaceful Settlement of Disputes between States” on its agenda  and commended the Secretary-General’s efforts towards the continued publication of the Repertory and the Repertoire. KOUSSAY ABDULJABBAR ALDAHHAK (Syrian Arab Republic)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that the painful situation of some Arab countries  including his  was a direct result of the lack of commitment by some influential countries to the Charter and international law.  The Israeli occupation of Arab territories showed the international community’s impotence  which rendered it unable to resolve the issue  in the face of the influential countries supporting Israel.  Those countries saw terrorism as a proper tool in achieving their interests  and had sent thousands of foreign terrorist fighters to threaten the Syrian State and inflict damage and evil upon the Syrian people.  Some Members imposed their national laws extraterritorially  using coercive measures on other countries  including the Syrian Arab Republic  which kept civilians from meeting their basic living needs.  There had been calls for such measures to immediately be cancelled  but the countries imposing such measures had turned their back on the United Nations and the Charter.  He rejected the hegemonic policy and double standards being conducted by those States  and supported the proposal of the Russian Federation and Belarus for an opinion from the International Court of Justice on the matter. Mr. LASRI (Morocco)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said sanctions applied by virtue of Chapter VII of the Charter should be imposed as a measure of last resort once all other means of peacefully resolving disputes had been exhausted.  As well  sanctions  if applied  should be for a specific and limited length of time  with a view to lifting them once they were no longer needed.  To peacefully settle disputes and cope with threats to peace and security  Member States must step up their efforts and develop a common vision in that endeavour.  He expressed support for any initiatives aimed at that  noting the Manila Declaration’s importance towards those goals.  He welcomed progress achieved with the Repertory and the Repertoire  noting that their publication was a means of preserving institutional memory.  They should be disseminated in the United Nations website in all official United Nations languages.  There was a need to ensure the management of resources allocated to the Special Committee.  An in-depth analysis was needed to make the work of that body more dynamic.  Overlap should be avoided on the basis of the General Assembly mandate. SHANG ZHEN (China)  noting the Committee’s continued deliberations on assistance to third States affected by sanctions  said the Security Council should impose sanctions only after all other peaceful means had been exhausted.  He expressed the hope that the Council would continue to improve its working methods and reduce the negative impact of sanctions on third States.  He further encouraged exploration of new ideas to address improving the working methods and efficiency of the Special Committee  also stating that no new item be considered if it involved amendment to the Charter  unless clearly mandated by the General Assembly.  On the Repertory and Repertoire  he expressed the hope that the Secretariat would continue to push for their simultaneous publication in all the Organization’s official languages. Ms. NWORGU (Nigeria)  associating herself with the African Group  said States had an obligation to ensure that relations between them deemphasized might over right.  The application and use of sanctions must be done in accordance with the Charter and international law principles.  She called on the International Law Commission to give due consideration to the legal consequences of sanctions affecting third States.  Sanctions should be used only after all peaceful means had been exhausted  she stressed  noting that procedures prescribing such measures were equally important.  Nigeria remained committed to respecting the rule of law through its relations with other States and close collaboration with the United Nations  and she voiced support for the work of the Special Committee  as well as the retention of the agenda item. NOUR ZARROUK BOUMIZA (Tunisia)  associating herself with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that reform of the United Nations was no longer an option.  First and foremost was reform of the Security Council.  The General Assembly also should respond more quickly to issues affecting peace and security.  In addition  sanctions regimes should take into account are their undesirable consequences  particularly for third party States affected.  Deliberations on the matter were far from exhausted.  A number of proposals under consideration by the Special Committee had reached maturation and should be ready for finalization.  She supported the registration of new current topics on the agenda. Right of Reply A representative of the Republic of Korea  in exercise of the right of reply  expressed regret at the biased comments made by the representative of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  noting that it was not the appropriate forum to discuss the status of the United Nations Command  which had been established by the Organization. A representative of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  in exercise of the right of reply  pointed out that this was the forum for all issues relating to the Charter  and that the Command had been formed illegally by the United States in abuse of the Charter.  He called on all delegates to look at the precarious situation on the Korean peninsula  caused principally by the presence of United States forces and its hostile policy towards his country  whose efforts towards creating a peaceful environment on the Peninsula had not received appropriate response from that country. Instead  he said  the United States had staged many joint military exercises over 60 years  with the stated purpose of occupying Pyongyang for a regime change. Further the United Nations Command had nothing to do with the Organization.  Citing a statement from the Deputy Spokesman of the Secretary-General from June 2013  he quoted  “The United Nations has never had any role in any armed forces in the Korean Peninsula.”  Further to that statement  the Organization had never played any role in the Unified Command between 1950 and 1953.  South Korea therefore had no right to name it in justifying the Command. Requests for Observer Status Introducing the request for Observer status for the Cooperation Council of Turkic-speaking States (documents A/66/141 and A/C.6/69/L.4)  a representative of Turkey said the Cooperation Council clearly met the established criteria  and therefore deserved to be granted observer status in the General Assembly.  In addition  she shared some of the Council’s activities since the Sixth Committee’s discussion last year. Delegates of Cyprus and Armenia expressed serious reservations about granting observer status  noting that the Council’s activities did not seem to meet the established criteria.  Armenia’s representative added that the declarations adopted annually by the Council and statements made by some of its members on behalf of the organization had contained provisions that contradicted the United Nations Charter.  Both delegates encouraged the resolution’s sponsors to consider withdrawing the item from the Committee’s agenda. Representatives of Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan echoed Turkey’s statement  with Kyrgyzstan’s representative noting that the Council’s interaction with other organizations was in the spirit of cooperation.  Azerbaijan’s representative also pointed out that Armenia did not comply with the United Nations Charter  and consistently violated principles and norms of international law. The Russian Federation’s representative said  given that consensus on the matter did not again seem possible  the Committee was faced with a dilemma.  There was a need to find an innovative approach that would retain the consensus nature of the work of the Committee. Turkey’s representative then addressed some comments regarding the limited membership of the Council and the Cyprus issue. In exercise of the right of reply  Armenia’s representative said that the delegate of Azerbaijan was politicizing discussion of the item  and was trying to side-track it by throwing an avalanche of lies against his country.  He asked that delegation to change its behaviour and engage in constructive discussion. Also in exercise of the right of reply  Cyprus’ delegate  in response to Turkey’s representative  recalled Security Council resolution 1251 (1999) on the situation in Cyprus. The Chair invited delegations to continue consultations on that item and said the Committee would revert to it at a later stage. A representative of France  introducing the request for Observer status for the International Chamber of Commerce (document A/67/191)  detailed the history of the request since it was first made in 2012.  Underscoring that although its membership was nearly universal  and its contributions to international development  peace and security had been recognized by the United Nations  as demonstrated by its observer status in the Economic and Social Council  several delegations had held that it did not meet one of the criteria for observer status in the General Assembly because it was not an inter-governmental organization. In discussions over the past two years  she said that two approaches had been broached to remedy the situation  the first being a review of the criteria under General Assembly decision 49/426 and the second  a presentation of the International Chamber of Commerce as a hybrid organization — part intergovernmental body and part association.  As it had become clear that neither was a satisfactory solution  and consensus could not be found to support the request at this time  she proposed closing discussion of the item in the Sixth (Legal) Committee  in favour of informal discussions  and returning to the Committee “when the time was ripe”. In discussions following  speakers recognized the merits of the organization and expressed appreciation for the flexibility and creativity shown by the representative of France in her approach to the request.  In that context  Argentina’s representative said that the responsibility of the Sixth Committee was not to modify the criteria under the General Assembly decision  but to ensure compliance with those criteria.  The representative of the Russian Federation welcomed the proposal of France as a creative way of moving forward. The Chair then invited delegations to continue consultations on that item  and said the Committee would revert to it at a later stage. A representative of Pakistan  introducing the request of Observer Status for the Developing Eight Countries Organization for Economic Cooperation in the General Assembly (document A/C.6/69/L.2)  stated that the “D-8” was an intergovernmental organization whose members included Bangladesh  Egypt  Indonesia  Iran  Malaysia  Nigeria  Pakistan and Turkey.  Its goal was to improve the position of developing countries in the world economy; diversify and create new opportunities in trade relations; enhance participation in decision-making at the international level; and provide a better standard of living to its populations. Thus  he stressed  the Organization’s activities were in the areas of interest to the General Assembly  and were conducted on principles in keeping with the United Nations.  Observer status would help the “D-8” achieve their objectives and further synergies between them and the United Nations.  He appealed to Member States to support the request from the participating eight countries. In the ensuing dialog  members of the “D-8” also called for their request to be supported  with Malaysia’s representative noting that its combined membership had vast development potential with large amounts of land  skilled labour  diversified human capital  rich natural resources and a market of more than 1 billion people.  Furthermore  the representative of Nigeria noted that the Organization was truly global  comprised of eight member countries from different regions.  Turkey’s representative added that the Organization had concluded international agreements. The Russian Federation’s representative  for the sake of clarity as to the legal status of the Organization  requested to see its charter.  Pakistan’s representative affirmed that that document would be provided. Concluding discussion of the item  the Chair said that action would be taken on the request at a later date. A representative of Fiji  introducing document A/C.6/69/L.3 on the granting of Observer status for the Pacific Community in the General Assembly  said that the Pacific Community was an international organization  established by treaty  which fully met the criteria of General Assembly decision 49/426.  As a technical body  it provided support in such areas as communications  transport  fisheries  forestry  industry  labour  trade and finance  public works  education  health  and housing  among others. It also facilitated research in technical  scientific  economic and social fields in the countries and territories within its scope  he said.  The Pacific Community was a critical enabling organization in response to the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 agenda.  Noting that observer status would help the organization to synchronize its initiatives with those of the United Nations  he called upon the Sixth Committee to support the request  thus bringing true sustainable development to the Pacific community. All speakers in the dialog that followed expressed support for the resolution  with a representative of the United States noting that observer status would help the Pacific Community to better carry out its objectives and Cuba’s representative noting that  as an organization for scientific research  it would be of assistance to the General Assembly. The representative of Cuba  in a general comment on the subject of recommending observer status in the General Assembly  said that it was not helpful to the analysis of each request to have them all presented on the same day.  She requested that the scheduling of those agenda items be taken into account for future meetings. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-14,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaspd559.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Reaffirming its commitment to eradicating the scourge of colonialism  the Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) today concluded its annual consideration of the question of decolonization  and forwarded 11 draft resolutions to the General Assembly  six of which were approved without a vote. The Committee  in keeping with tradition  approved without a vote its omnibus draft resolution on Questions of American Samoa  Anguilla  Bermuda  British Virgin Islands  Cayman Islands  Guam  Montserrat  Pitcairn  Saint Helena  Turks and Caicos Islands and the United States Virgin Islands. That text would have the General Assembly reaffirm that it was ultimately for the peoples of the Territories themselves to determine freely their future political status. By the terms of the draft resolution on the Question of French Polynesia — also approved without a vote — the General Assembly would call upon the Government of France to intensify its dialogue with that Territory in order to facilitate rapid progress towards a fair and effective self-determination process. Other draft resolutions approved without a vote today included three on the specific territories of New Caledonia  Tokelau and Western Sahara.  The sixth text was on study and training facilities for inhabitants of Non-Self-Governing Territories.  A draft decision on Gibraltar would be considered at a later date. Among the five texts requiring a recorded vote was a draft resolution on information from Non-Self-Governing Territories transmitted under Article 73 (e) of the Charter  which had 157 in favour to 0 against  with 4 abstentions (France  Israel  United Kingdom  United States). Among the terms of that draft  the General Assembly would request the administering Powers concerned to transmit regularly to the Secretary-General information on economic  social and educational conditions  as well as political and constitutional developments in the Territories. By a recorded vote of 159 in favour to 2 against (Israel  United States)  with 2 abstentions (France  United Kingdom)  the Committee approved a draft resolution on economic and other activities which affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories. That text would have the General Assembly urge the administering Powers concerned to take effective measures to safeguard and guarantee the inalienable right of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories to their natural resources and to establish and maintain control over the future development of those resources. The Committee also approved by a recorded vote of 113 in favour to 0 against  with 51 abstentions  a draft resolution on implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations.  By terms of that draft  the General Assembly would urge those and other organizations of the United Nations system that have not yet provided assistance to Non-Self-Governing Territories to do so as soon as possible. A draft resolution on dissemination of information on decolonization was approved by a recorded vote of 160 in favour to 3 against (Israel  United Kingdom  United States)  with 1 abstention (France).  By the terms of that text  the Assembly would consider it important to expand its efforts to ensure the widest-possible dissemination of information on decolonization  with particular emphasis on the options for self-determination available for the peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories. The fifth text  approved by a recorded vote  was a draft resolution on the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  which had 161 in favour to 3 against (United Kingdom  United States  Israel)  with 2 abstentions (France  Bangladesh).  By its terms  the Assembly would affirm its support for the aspirations of the peoples under colonial rule to exercise their right to self-determination  including independence. Speaking during the action on items were representatives of the United Kingdom  Russian Federation  Argentina  Spain and the Bahamas.  A representative of the European Union Delegation also contributed. Before consideration of those texts  the Committee heard from the representatives of three States as its general debate on decolonization concluded.  Calling for dialogue between Argentina and the United Kingdom  the representative of Chile urged both countries to desist from unilateral measures  stressing the need avoid unlawful exploitation of natural resources. The representative of Algeria  stressing that colonialism had no place in today’s world  said it was the primary responsibility of the United Nations to work for emancipation of the non-self-governing territories.  The Western Sahara question should be determined by its people in accordance with the legally binding decolonization mandate. The representative of Morocco said his Government was committed to a peaceful settlement of the Western Sahara question also in the interest of peace and stability of the wider region.  Morocco’s initiative for an autonomous status for the territory was considered serious and credible by the international community and provided the basis for an acceptable solution in a spirit of compromise. The representatives of the United Kingdom and Argentina spoke in exercise of the right of reply. The Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. on Wednesday  15 October  to begin consideration on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space. Background The Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) met this morning to conclude its consideration of decolonization issues and take action on several related draft resolutions  contained in the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with Regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2014 (document A/69/23).  Also before the Committee were draft resolutions on Offers by Member States for training for inhabitants of Non-Self-Governing Territories (document A/C.4/69/L.3); and Question of Western Sahara (document A/C.4/69/L.4). Statements in Debate JOSE ANTONIO COUSIÑO (Chile)  associating with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  Union of South American Nations and the Southern Common Market  said that  despite the success of the Special Committee over the decades  the decolonization process was far from over.  Stressing the special character of the Malvinas Islands (Falklands)*  he supported Argentina’s sovereignty rights over those territories and surrounding maritime areas.  Calling for dialogue between the two parties  he urged the United Kingdom to fulfil its obligations under United Nations resolutions and both countries to desist from unilateral measures.  In particular  he stressed the need to avoid unlawful exploitation of natural resources and military activities in the disputed area.  He welcomed the recent United Nations’ work on decolonization  including visiting missions and dissemination of information  and called for greater efforts by all parties. SABRI BOUKADOUM (Algeria) said colonialism had no place in today’s world and must be eliminated wherever it existed.  It was the primary responsibility of the United Nations to work for emancipation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories.  Women and men were born free and it was the world’s duty to ensure they remained so.  There was no alternative to full implementation of the principle of self-determination.  The Special Committee  in order to discharge its mandate effectively  should remain fully engaged.  On Western Sahara  he said it had been a decolonization issue since it was under Spanish colonial rule  adding that Algeria had not changed its stance on the issue.  The question should thus be determined by the Saharan people in accordance with the legally binding decolonization mandate.  The people’s human rights and right to natural resources must be fully respected.  Recalling the African Union’s full commitment to a settlement and the appointment of a special representative  he said the stalemate must be broken through direct talks between the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro (Frente Polisario) and Morocco. OMAR HILALE (Morocco) said the Committee was engaged in its work this year in the context of a resurgence of terrorism and expressions of strong international determination against it.  Morocco was committed to a peaceful settlement of the Western Sahara question and in the peace and stability of the wider region.  It was Morocco that had put the question before the United Nations  at a time when Frente Polisario had not even existed.  The Madrid Agreement was not acceptable to some parties  which resulted in conflict.  Morocco’s initiative for an autonomous status for the territory was considered serious and credible by the international community and a basis for an acceptable solution in a spirit of compromise.  Resuscitation of old plans would not help the cause of peace and stability  he said  adding that Morocco’s initiative could be improved upon but not cast aside.  Citing Morocco’s positive record on human rights in the territory  he urged greater such efforts for the people of the Tindouf camps. Right of Reply The representative of the United Kingdom said his Government had no doubt about its position on the Falkland Islands (Malvinas).  In 2013  the people in the territory had voted overwhelmingly to remain with the United Kingdom  a decision that had been submitted to the United Nations.  He rejected claims of militarization of the region  saying levels had been reduced since the conflict in 1983.  He also rejected allegations that the United Kingdom was exploiting the territory’s natural resources.  On the Turks and Caicos Islands  he said the United Kingdom would meet its obligations.  The South Sandwich and South Georgia Islands would remain Overseas Territories. The representative of Argentina said the Malvinas (Falklands)  South Georgia Islands and South Sandwich Islands were illegally occupied by the United Kingdom  and he urged a resumption of negotiations for a settlement as indicated by the United Nations.  Instead  the United Kingdom had been distorting history to press its unlawful claims.  The General Assembly had discarded the self-determination principle in the Malvinas Islands (Falklands) because of the special nature of the sovereignty dispute.  The referendum was a spurious exercise in which British subjects residing on the Islands had been asked whether they would want to remain British.  The region’s militarization should be understood within the context of Britain’s legacy of imperialism. Action on Texts The Committee turned first to agenda item 56 and draft resolution I  on information from Non-Self-Governing Territories transmitted under Article 73 (e) of the United Nations Charter  approving it by a recorded vote of 157 in favour to 0 against  with 4 abstentions (France  Israel  United Kingdom  United States). Among the terms of that draft  the General Assembly would request the administering Powers concerned to transmit regularly to the Secretary-General for information purposes statistical and other information of a technical nature relating to economic  social and educational conditions in the Territories for which they were respectively responsible  as well as the fullest possible information on political and constitutional developments in the Territories. Speaking in explanation of vote after the vote  the representative of the United Kingdom said that his delegation did not take issue with the main objective of the resolution.  The country continued to meet its obligations in that regard with its Overseas Territories  however  it believed that the decision as to whether a Non-Self-Governing Territory had reached the level of self-government was ultimately for the Government of the Territory and the administering Power to decide  and not for the General Assembly. Next  the Committee approved draft resolution II on economic and other activities which affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories  by a recorded vote of 159 in favour to 2 against (Israel  United States)  with 2 abstentions (France  United Kingdom). That text would have the General Assembly urge the administering Powers concerned to take effective measures to safeguard and guarantee the inalienable right of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories to their natural resources and to establish and maintain control over the future development of those resources.  It would request the administering Powers to take all steps necessary to protect the property rights of the peoples of those Territories. Speaking in explanation of position after the vote  the representative of Argentina stated that self-determination required an active subject in order to be exercised  namely  a people living under alien subjugation.  Without that  there was no right to self-determination.  The Malvinas (Falkland)  South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas had been illegitimately occupied by the United Kingdom  which had expelled the population by force and replaced it with British nationals.  That rendered the issue of self-determination non-applicable to the Malvinas Islands (Falklands). The draft resolution just approved  said the speaker  did not apply to the question of the Malvinas (Falklands)  South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas.  General Assembly resolutions on the Malvinas (Falklands)  as well as those approved today  had expressly established that the way to put an end to that colonial situation was not through self-determination  but a negotiated solution to the sovereignty dispute between the only two parties  the United Kingdom and Argentina. The General Assembly  continued the speaker  had discarded the applicability of the self-determination principle to the Malvinas (Falklands)  South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas.  Further  in resolution 31/49  the Assembly asked Argentina and the United Kingdom to refrain from adopting decisions that introduced unilateral modifications while the Islands were in the negotiation process recommended by the Assembly.  Therefore  the unilateral and illegal exploitation of renewable and non-renewable natural energy sources by the United Kingdom was openly contrary to the United Nations resolutions. The Committee then turned to draft resolution III on implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations  by which the General Assembly would urge those and other organizations of the United Nations system that had not yet provided assistance to the Non-Self-Governing Territories to do so as soon as possible.  It would ask the United Nations system and regional organizations to strengthen existing measures of support and formulate appropriate programmes of assistance for the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories  in order to accelerate progress in their economic and social sectors. Speaking before the vote  the representative of the Russian Federation expressed his support for the achievement of the rights to independence and self-determination of the people of the Non-Self-Governing Territories and for the Special Committee’s plan of action on the elimination of colonialism.  However  the consideration of this extremely political question under the Economic and Social Council draws it away from its main issues of coordinating activities in the economic sphere.  Therefore  the Russian Federation had abstained. That text was then approved by a recorded vote of 113 in favour to 0 against  with 51 abstentions. Speaking in explanation of position after the vote  the representative of the United Kingdom reaffirmed his country’s support for the specialized agencies  but said that the status of those agencies must be carefully respected.  The delegation  therefore  had abstained. Also speaking in explanation of vote  the representative of Argentina said that the draft resolution must be applied in conformity with the relevant United Nations decisions and resolutions  including of the General Assembly and the Special Committee on Decolonization  on the specific Territories. The Committee then turned to the draft resolution on offers by Member States of study and training facilities for inhabitants of Non-Self-Governing Territories (document A/C.4/69/L.3)  approving it without a vote. By its terms  the General Assembly would urge the administering Powers to take effective measures to ensure widespread and continuous dissemination in the Territories of information relating to offers of study and training facilities made by States  and to provide all necessary facilities to enable students to avail themselves of such offers. The Committee then turned to the draft resolution on the Question of Western Sahara (document A/C.4/68/L.4).  By the terms of the revised text  the Assembly would welcome the commitment of the parties to continue to show political will and work in an atmosphere propitious for dialogue  in order to enter into a more intensive phase of negotiations.  It would call on the parties to cooperate with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and to abide by their obligations under international humanitarian law. Making a general statement before the vote  CARL HALLERGARD of the European Union Delegation  welcomed the resolution and reaffirmed support for the Secretary-General’s efforts to achieve a just and acceptable political solution providing self-determination to the Saharan people.  The European Union encouraged the parties to work towards a solution within the framework of the United Nations.  Welcoming the adoption of United Nations Security Council resolution 2152 (2014)  he favoured the parties’ commitment to continue to work towards dialogue in order to enter an intensive phase of negotiations.  He also expressed full support for the methodology of “shuttle diplomacy” and encouraged the parties to cooperate with the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). Encouraging the parties to collaborate with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in implementing confidence-building measures  he supported the Council’s request of UNHCR that it maintain its consideration of a refugee registration in the Tindouf camps.  He welcomed the progress made  mainly the expansion of the number of beneficiaries from the family visits and on the implementation of the Plan of Action.  Nevertheless  the European Union remained concerned about the implication of Western Sahara conflict on security and cooperation in the region. The Committee then approved the draft resolution without a vote. Next  the Committee turned to a package of drafts IV  V  VI and VII  approving all without a vote. By the terms of draft resolution IV on the Question of New Caledonia  the General Assembly would urge all parties involved  in the interest of all the people of New Caledonia and within the framework of the Noumea Accord  to maintain their dialogue in the spirit of harmony. Draft resolution V on the Question of French Polynesia would have the Assembly call upon the Government of France to intensify its dialogue with that Territory in order to facilitate rapid progress towards a fair and effective self-determination process  under which the terms and timelines for an act of self-determination would be agreed. The Assembly would request the Secretary-General  in cooperation with relevant specialized agencies of the United Nations  to compile a report on the environmental  ecological  health and other impacts as a consequence of the 30-year period of nuclear testing in the Territory. According to draft resolution VI  on the Question of Tokelau  the Assembly would welcome the commitment of both the Territory and New Zealand to work together in the interests of Tokelau and its people and call on the administering Power and United Nations agencies to provide assistance to Tokelau as it further developed. The terms of draft resolution VII  on Questions of American Samoa  Anguilla  Bermuda  the British Virgin Islands  the Cayman Islands  Guam  Montserrat  Pitcairn  Saint Helena  the Turks and Caicos Islands and the United States Virgin Islands  the Assembly would reaffirm that it was ultimately for the peoples of the Territories themselves to determine freely their future political status.  It would also have the Assembly urge Member States to contribute to the efforts of the United Nations to usher in a world free of colonialism. Speaking in explanation of position after the vote on draft VII  the representative of Spain said he joined the consensus on the resolution and backed the principle of self-determination.  However  that principle was not the only relevant condition for self-determination in the case of Gibraltar.  Spain was willing to work on the question of Gibraltar  but only through conversations with the United Kingdom. Also speaking in explanation of vote after the vote  the representative of the United Kingdom stated that his country regretted that the Special Committee on Decolonization continued its outdated approach and failed to take into account how the relationship between his country and its Overseas Territories had modernized.  Some of the language  therefore  was unacceptable to the United Kingdom.  Nor did his country accept the assertion that the people of Gibraltar did not have the right to self-determination. Also speaking in explanation of position  Argentina’s representative expressed support for the right of self-determination in the Territories.  The exercise of that right should be in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people of the Territories concerned.  In that connection  Argentina reiterated its long-standing call to the administering Powers to work in cooperation with the United Nations system to develop education programmes  which fostered an awareness of the right to self-determination.  At the same time  in accordance with resolution 1514 (XV)  the principle of self-determination was only one of two guiding tenets that applied to Non-Self-Governing Territories.  The question of the Malvinas Islands (Falklands) was to be considered a “special and particular case” where the principle of territorial integrity  as established by numerous General Assembly resolutions  was also to be considered.  He reiterated his country’s “permanent willingness” to renew negotiations with the United Kingdom. The Committee next approved draft resolution VIII on dissemination of information on decolonization by a recorded vote of 160 in favour to 3 against (Israel  United Kingdom  United States)  with 1 abstention (France). By the terms of that text  the Assembly would consider it important to expand its efforts to ensure the widest-possible dissemination of information on decolonization  with particular emphasis on the options for self-determination available for the peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories  and to that end  request the Department of Public Information  through the United Nations Information Centres  to actively seek new and innovative ways to disseminate material to the Territories. Speaking in explanation of vote after the vote  the representative of the United Kingdom said his delegation had opposed the text  as the obligations on the Secretariat placed an unwarranted drain on its scarce resources  which was unacceptable. Also speaking in explanation of vote after the vote  the representative of Argentina expressed firm support for self-determination of the peoples that remained under colonial occupation.  However  the approved text should be interpreted in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Fourth Committee.  All of their pronouncements on the Malvinas Islands (Falklands) had characterized it as a special colonial situation and acknowledged that it involved a sovereignty dispute over the Malvinas (Falklands)  South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas  between Argentina and the United Kingdom as the only two parties.  The resolutions also had established that the only way to solve that dispute was by reconvening bilateral negotiations leading to a fair  peaceful and permanent solution as soon as possible  which took into account the interests of the people of the Territories. Next  the Committee approved draft resolution IX on the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  by a recorded vote of 161 in favour to 3 against (United Kingdom  United States and Israel)  with 2 abstentions (Bangladesh  France).  By the terms of the resolution  the Assembly would affirm its support for the aspirations of the peoples under colonial rule to exercise their right to self-determination  including independence.  The Assembly would request the Special Committee to  among other things  formulate specific proposals to bring about an end to colonialism and to report thereon to it at its next session. Also speaking in explanation of vote after the vote was the representative of the United Kingdom  who said his delegation had voted against the text  as his country continued to find some of its elements unacceptable.  Despite that negative vote  the United Kingdom remained committed to modernizing the relationships with its Overseas Territories  taking into account the views of their people. Also speaking in explanation of vote after the vote  the representative of Argentina stated that visiting missions should only proceed in those Territories where there was no sovereignty dispute.  Furthermore  the General Assembly should approve the sending of any visiting mission. The representative of Spain said that he had voted in favour of this resolution  but stressed that self-determination was not the only principle governing the decolonization process.  Furthermore  the General Assembly should send visiting missions to only those territories where there was no sovereignty dispute. The representative of the Bahamas  speaking after the passage of draft VII on the question of American Samoa  Anguilla  Bermuda  the British Virgin Islands  the Cayman Islands  Guam  Montserrat  Pitcairn  Saint Helena  Turks and Caicos Island and the United States Virgin Island  under agenda item 59.  The Bahamas reaffirmed its interest and concerns about Turks and Caicos Island.  The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) had endorsed the report of the mission establishing the political  economic realities of Turks and Caicos  as well as the conduct of a referendum to seek the views of the people the island.  She expressed grave concerns following the election of 2011  as the overall state of political affairs was still less than desirable.  She reaffirmed her support for the full restoration of democracy. It was announced that consideration of a draft decision of the Question of Gibraltar would be taken up at a later date. * A dispute exists between the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (Malvinas). Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-14,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaef3399.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The General Assembly should continue considering sustainable urbanization in the post-2015 agenda and promote it as a transformational force for achieving and advancing sustainable national development  the Second Committee (Economic and Financial) heard today as delegates met to consider the implementation of the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) and strengthening of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat). Joan Clos  Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of UN-Habitat  detailed preparations for Habitat III  and called on the Assembly to integrate equity in sustainable urbanization policies to address structural policies and challenges of poverty and inequality that faced many cities. Poverty and inequality were starkly presented by one billion people living in urban slums right next to modern high-rise buildings  said Bolivia’s representative  stressing that sustainable cities and human settlements would represent a major development challenge over the coming decades. Noting how the accelerated and poorly controlled urbanization process had contributed to the degradation of living conditions  Senegal’s representative called for the promotion of urbanization policies and sustainable urban management. Significant progress had been made since Habitat II  said Indonesia’s representative  but several challenges remained.  Those included the rapid urbanization process in developing countries  the increase in the number of urban slum dwellers  and the negative impact of environmental degradation on human settlements. He called on the post-2015 development agenda to reaffirm the universal relevance of well-planned and well-managed cities as drivers for change  and to include the key aspects of sustainable cities and human settlements. Several delegates welcomed the proposal by the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals for a standalone goal on human settlements and cities.  Moreover  El Salvador’s representative noted that habitat issues were not only included in the dedicated Goal 11  but also in Goal 6 on water and sanitation  Goal 7 on access to energy  and Goal 9 on infrastructure  industrialization and innovation. Linkages between rural and urban areas were mentioned several times.  China’s representative said that development of both areas should proceed in an integrated way  as settlements were interlinked and complementary.  Similarly  South Africa’s representative noted that while cities were vital to a country’s overall economic development and growth  the rural areas remained responsible for food production  essential resources like water  and migrant labour. India’s representative also called for a broad approach to cities that acknowledged their “organic linkages with their surrounding ecosystems  in particular the semi-urban and rural areas”.  Moreover  sustainable urbanization was not only a developing country issue  though challenges differed.  For developing countries  urban citizens needed more public services and jobs  while environmental stress of policies should be limited.  Developed countries  on the other hand  should lead on lowering their cities’ ecological footprint  renovating infrastructure  retrofitting buildings and improving efficiency. During the afternoon session  the Committee held a joint meeting with the Economic and Social Council on lessons learned from the debt crises and the ongoing work on sovereign debt restructuring and debt resolution mechanisms.  The meetings were co-Chaired by Sebastiano Cardi (Italy)  Chair of the Second Committee (Economic and Financial)  and President of the Economic and Social Council  Martin Sajdik (Austria). In the first panel  panellists discussed their experiences with policy responses to contagion and debt crises and how they affected future debt restructuring.  Antonio De Lecea  the Principal Adviser for Economic and Financial Affairs  European Union Delegation to the United States  explained how the Union’s high degree of integration posed challenges that had initially been underestimated as the financial crisis took hold and created a “perfect storm”.  The European Union “had to repair the ship in the middle of the storm”  he said. Mr. De Lecea was joined by Paulo Nogueira Batista  Executive Director for Northern South America  International Monetary Fund (IMF); and Anna Gelpern  Professor of Law  Georgetown University.  Mr. Batista described the debt crisis in Argentina and changes made to collective action clauses in debt contracts.  Reforms were insufficient  though  and the IMF was critical of board members who wished to go into “mission accomplished mode”.  Ms. Gelpern meanwhile  described the legal landscape of debt restructuring  calling sovereign debt a “bizarre institution” as the only debt that was not directly enforceable  while also the only kind that never went away.  Despite its peculiarities  debt was “the lifeblood of the global financial system” and the main problems with restructuring related to efficiency  fairness and legitimacy. The second panel discussed ongoing work on sovereign debt restructuring and debt resolution mechanisms.  It was moderated by Alex Trepelkov  Director  Financing for Development Office  Department of Economic and Social Affairs  and also featured three panellists.  They were:  Reza Baqir  Chief  Debt Policies Division  IMF; Yuefen Li  Head  Debt and Development Finance Branch  United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD); and Benu Schneider  Senior Economic Affairs Officer  Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Panellists focused on the work of the IMF in the field  described the work of UNCTAD and the outstanding systemic problems like legal forum fragmentation  and a Department of Economic and Social Affairs project that aimed to foster mutual understanding among stakeholders on sovereign debt restructuring. Speaking today on UN-Habitat were representatives of Morocco  Antigua and Barbuda (on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM))  Costa Rica (on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC))  Malawi (on behalf of the African Group)  Brazil  Ecuador  Japan  Algeria  Belarus  United Arab Emirates  Bahrain  Singapore  Argentina  Kenya and Russian Federation.  A representative of the International Organization for Migration also spoke. The Committee will meet again at 10 a.m.  on 15 October to consider Item 19 of its agenda:  Sustainable development. Background The Second Committee (Economic and Financial) met this morning to consider UN-Habitat and this afternoon to hold a joint meeting with the Economic and Social Council on the debt crises. UN-Habitat JOAN CLOS  Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director  United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT)  introduced the Secretary-General’s report on “implementation of the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements Programme (Habitat II) and strengthening of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT)” (document A/69/298) and a note by the Secretary-General transmitting the report on the coordinated implementation of the Habitat agenda (document A/69/343).  As well as detailing preparations for Habitat III  he highlighted the need to decide on the venue  final dates  format and organizational aspects of the conference  and to decide on the venue and duration of the third and final preparatory committee meeting.  Participation of local Governments and all other stakeholders in the preparatory process and the conference itself had to be ensured  with national reports submitted to the Habitat III Secretariat and funding provided for national  regional and global preparations. With respect to urbanization and the UN-Habitat programme  he urged the General Assembly to continue considering sustainable urbanization and human settlements in the post-2015 agenda and to promote it as a transformational force for achieving and advancing sustainable national development.  The Assembly should implement sustainable transport systems  focused on accessibility  and integrate equity in sustainable urbanization policies to address structural policies and challenges of poverty and inequality that faced many cities.  An increase in the regular budget for UN-Habitat was needed to develop the additional capacity required for implementation of the strategic plan for 2014-2019. VALERIA DENISSE VILASECA CHUMACERO (Bolivia)  speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China  said that sustainable cities and human settlement would be a major development challenge over the next several decades.  Rapid urbanization in Africa  Asia  Latin America and the Caribbean was moving hunger and poverty from rural to urban areas.  With the shift occurring largely in developing countries  it was important to promote cities’ resilience against the effects of climate change.  World leaders had at the Rio+20 conference recognized the importance of sustainable urbanization.  Poverty and inequality  two important elements of the sustainable development goals that needed to be a part of the post-2015 development agenda  were starkly presented by one billion people living in urban slums right next to modern high-rise buildings. A multisectorial approach that engaged all stakeholders in an inclusive manner required transformative policies on sustainable urban development and human settlement  she said.  New modalities of interaction at all levels were needed for central and local national governments to fulfil their roles as governmental stakeholders in global efforts on sustainability.  Financing was a critical constraint  and developed countries’ commitments needed to be fulfilled.   At this important phase of preparation for the “Habitat III” United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development to be held in 2016  the international community needed to work together. Following the speaker  the representative of Morocco noted the importance of Habitat III to Africa  the country’s efforts on sustainable urban development and the work of the United Nations on the same item.  In reply  Mr. Clos said Habitat III would be the first implementation conference of the post-2015 development agenda  and that UN-Habitat had recognized Morocco for its work on urbanization and provision of social housing. TUMASIE BLAIR (Antigua and Barbuda)  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and associating with the “Group of 77” developing countries and China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  stressed the importance of voluntary funding in preparation for Habitat III  and called for financial and technical support from development partners for the Habitat agenda.  Environmental responsibility  social awareness and economic vitality were important tools in sustainable urbanization.  The Samoa Pathway outcome document would be an effective tool for small island developing States who faced the overwhelming challenges of population growth and the increase of slums  poverty  and lack of access to basics like water and sanitation.  There should be greater effort in educating the international community to change consumption patterns and lifestyles with respect to land use and urban sprawl.  Building regional capacity should take priority. GEORGINA GUILLEN-GRILLO (Costa Rica)  speaking on behalf of CELAC  reiterated the importance of commitments by the Member States to the building of sustainable cities  and of equitable access to basic urban services.  He recalled resolution 24/14 of the Governing Council of UN-Habitat  which called for voluntary financial support for those initiatives  and asked Member States and stakeholders to “actively” contribute to the Habitat conference.  It was essential to address rapid urbanization by implementing policies to prevent social distress  geographic exclusion and environmental degradation.  In order to face future development needs  cities like Lima and Bogota  which were expected to grow to 10 million people by 2025  would require strong commitments in the form of joint efforts  agreed actions and collective initiatives from all stakeholders.  He looked forward to substantial advances through continued debate in Habitat III and the fundraising to support it  and strongly supported Ecuador’s proposal to host that conference. DESRA PERCAYA (Indonesia)  speaking on behalf of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  and associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that by the middle of the twenty-first century  seven out of 10 people would live in cities  with most of the urbanization expected to take place in developing countries.  Accordingly  the post-2015 development agenda was an opportunity to reaffirm the universal relevance of well-planned and well-managed cities as real drivers for change  and must include the key aspects of sustainable cities and human settlements.  Significant progress had been made since the Habitat II conference  but challenges remained  including the rapid urbanization process in developing countries; the continuing increase in the number of urban slum dwellers in the world; the negative impact of environmental degradation on human settlements  including climate change  desertification and loss of biodiversity; the increasing vulnerability of urban settlements to natural and human-made disasters; and urban poverty and inequalities within cities. Cities in ASEAN were the primary sources of wealth  he said  generating about 80 per cent of that region’s total gross domestic product (GDP).  Yet  they faced numerous challenges to be environmentally sustainable and liveable.  It had been a challenge to meet the expectations that came with the increasing incomes of the region’s population of 600 million; compounded by high rates of rural-urban migration.  The Association was committed to ensuring the environmental sustainability of its urban areas  while meeting its people’s social and economic needs.  The completion of “Clean Air for Small Cities Projects” in 2012  for example  had successfully enhanced the capacity of smaller and medium-sized cities to develop and implement measures to improve their air quality. CHARLES P. MSOSA (Malawi)  speaking on behalf of the African Group  associated his statement with that delivered on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.  With over half the world’s population living in cities and towns  urban areas were facing climate change  resource depletion  food insecurity  and a host of other challenges.  Africa wanted to reap the benefits of sustainable urbanization  but was confronted with rural poverty  a chief driver of urbanization.  Calling for a comprehensive approach in tackling sustainable urbanization  in the context of the post-2015 development agenda  the African Group asserted that poverty and inequality among urban and rural populations must be a part of consultations. The first session of the Preparatory Committee for the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) had provided a unique opportunity to take stock of progress  he said.  African countries had in 2013 launched a project articulating the continent’s regional priorities for the next 20 years in the area of housing and urban development.  Likewise  the African Ministerial Conference on Housing and Urban Development held in February 2014 in N’Djamena had outlined key priorities  which formed the continent’s aligned input to the upcoming Habitat III Conference. KINGSLEY MAMABOLO (South Africa)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the African Group  made several recommendations for the preparatory process leading to the Habitat III conference  including the issue of the venue.  That site must take into account the principle of fair geographical rotation and the capacity of the candidate-select host country.  South Africa had been a proponent of the Habitat Agenda and had adopted a comprehensive plan for the development of a sustainable human settlement agenda.  He highlighted the importance of the intimate linkages between rural and urban areas.  While cities were vital to the country’s overall economic development and growth  the rural areas remained responsible for food production  essential resources like water and for migrant labour.  In building on the Habitat Agenda  he called for a continued focus on addressing the needs of women  youth and vulnerable groups. SERGIO RODRIGUES DOS SANTOS (Brazil)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and CELAC  described the growing importance of urban expansion and integrated urban planning  and noted the focus of his country’s urban policies on social and economic inclusion and economic sustainability.  He welcomed inclusion of a standalone sustainable development goal on cities and hoped decisions contained in the Rio+20 outcome would be included in the post-2015 development agenda.  Habitat III would be very important  particularly as it would be the first major United Nations conference following adoption of the new agenda.  Preparations should establish a mutually supportive nexus between work in Nairobi and developments in New York on the goals and post-2015 agenda.  The resolution should set rules of procedure for Habitat III and needed to define modalities for civil society and local government participation in preparations and the conference itself. XAVIER LASSO MENDOZA (Ecuador)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and CELAC  underscored the importance of moving ahead on urban development.  Sustainable urbanization must be one of the priorities of the post-2015 development agenda  which should also address access to services for the most vulnerable groups  such as the elderly  people with disabilities and children.  Accelerated urbanization in major population centres in the region had led to distortions in its cities as well as to inequities and general exclusion of their new inhabitants.  He said they must look at the resilience of cities and their ability to deal with disasters  in which context his country had established a secretariat responsible for preventing and reducing risks.  Ecuador’s housing and settlements policies expressed its aspirations to build a society where people could live well. TOMOKO ONISHI (Japan) was pleased to see that the human settlement issue had been included in the report.  Considering Habitat III to be the key vehicle for the implementation of the post-2015 agenda  her country had established a national committee for the conference to draft the national report.  She highlighted the decreasing and aging population  and cities’ resilience to natural disasters as the new challenges facing Japan  especially considering the rapid urbanization in the Asia-Pacific region.  She expressed her hope for the conference to set a positive example of true accountability  and to be organized in the most efficient and cost-effective manner  with the Second Committee’s work providing guidance. KHALED BENHAMADI (Algeria)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  pointed to his country’s high level of urbanization.  He noted that implementation of the Government’s housing policies and programmes had improved living conditions for the population.  Between 2008 and 2013  2 million housing units had been built to improve occupation levels.  Algerian cities lagged in certain areas and a National Land Management Scheme had been launched for the period 2010-2030 to improve cities.  Qualitative policies for city management were needed and he welcomed the Open Working Group’s proposal of a standalone goal on settlements and cities.  UN-Habitat should adhere to the principle of universality in representation on its administrative council. Mr. ZDOROV (Belarus) said the role and need for UN-Habitat was increasing and he called for widening of its geographic reach to include Eastern Europe.  A report on the Status of European Cities in Transition was released in 2013 which dealt with former socialist States in Europe.  Improvements had been recorded across the region but they were not consistent.  UN-Habitat should increase its cooperation with and resource and technical support for middle-income countries  especially on modern and sustainable city planning.  He called for joint work between UN-Habitat  the Economic and Social Council and Member States to find common approaches on sustainable development.  He noted establishment of a UN-Habitat methodological centre in Minsk to report on members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)  noting that more cooperation between UN-Habitat and the CIS could improve planning in the region. AMIT NARANG (India)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  noted that urbanization’s transformative potential had been recognized in several forums and called for a broad approach to cities that acknowledged their “organic linkages with their surrounding ecosystems  in particular the semi-urban and rural areas.”  Sustainable urbanization was “by no means only a developing country issue”  though challenges differed.  For developing countries  urban citizens needed more public services and jobs  while environmental stress of policies should be limited.  Developed countries should lead on lowering their cities’ ecological footprint  renovating infrastructure  retrofitting buildings and improving efficiency.  India’s urban areas housed under a third of the population but accounted for over two-thirds of the country’s GDP and 90 per cent of Government revenues.  A total of $1.2 billion had been invested in building 100 “smart cities” that used information technology to improve efficiency  with an energy conservation code and design guidelines introduced. ABDULLAH RASHID AL SUWAIDI (United Arab Emirates)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that  given its rapidly growing population  his country was a model for modern urban planning.  Despite enormous challenges  it had managed to achieve housing sustainability  building one of the most sustainable cities in the world.  The country was a model for sustainable development in a desert environment  and its strategy should be translated into local solutions around the world.  Urbanization challenges could be achieved through the Habitat Agenda  and he looked forward to the Habitat III conference.  His country focused on strategies that would create more equitable and sustainable urbanization systems  and it hoped to participate in the development of the new urban agenda  and in finding effective ways to accommodate the increasing urbanization around the world. IBRAHIMA SORY SYLLA (Senegal)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the African Group  said that imbalances in human settlements and demographic growth had led to the accelerated and poorly controlled urbanization process  which had contributed to the continued degradation of urban living conditions.  Urbanization policies and sustainable urban management must be promoted  and Senegal was committed to the path of urban renewal.  His Government had implemented effective habitat and urbanization policies  but various constraints had to be addressed.  To achieve sustainable development  priority action in urban areas and human settlements management must centre around several issues  including disaster risk prevention and adaptation to climate change  energy efficiency  financial resources allocation  and the implementation of viable transport systems focused on accessibility.  In view of Habitat III  he invited States to facilitate the participation of all stakeholders in the preparatory process. MAJED AL NOAIMI (Bahrain) stressed the importance of the link between the Habitat III outcome document and the post-2015 development agenda.  The current economic threats called for a fairer urban development  which would reduce threats to countries’ security and stability.  He called for help to be given to poor countries to ensure a decent life and prosperity of their people.  The world faced huge challenges of the deterioration of human settlements and the growth of slums.  His country had developed housing  health and communications infrastructure that would keep pace with the growth of its population  and it was building more housing units to meet its citizens’ needs for decent living. GERARDINE JONG (Singapore)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China and ASEAN  stressed that  with unprecedented worldwide urbanization  Governments should continue to improve cities.  Singapore was doing its best in that regard  but it was “not an easy feat”.  Their long-term  integrated approach to land use optimization planned 50 years ahead.  A 2009 Sustainable Singapore Blueprint and a 2012  $108 million Land and Liveability National Innovation Challenge looked to create cost effective  liveable spaces.  Through the Singapore Centre for Liveable Cities it compiled a framework for integrated planning and governance that could be a basis for urban development among other high-population growth cities.  It shared best practices of urban leadership when it worked jointly with China and co-chaired the Group of Friends for Sustainable Cities with Sweden.  Singapore was committed to move forward to Habitat III in 2016. JOSEFINA BUNGE (Argentina)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China and CELAC  stressed the need for a proactive  cross-cutting approach from the State to urbanization.  State actions and policies should emphasize poverty eradication and gender equality with social inclusion a major objective.  Active State involvement in urbanization in South America had produced improvements in citizens’ quality of life  with statistics supporting the trend in Argentina.  Between 2001 and 2010  Argentines with at least one unmet need fell from 14 per cent to 9 per cent  while the proportion of the population with access to health care increased from 52 per cent to 62 per cent in the same period thanks to the building of 2 200 public hospitals.  Building of houses led to a decline in substandard dwellings and a reduction in overcrowding.  A comprehensive  interlinked view of the urban setting was needed to overcome remaining challenges  with urban land use in need of democratization and people in those areas needing opportunities to sustain lives there. ZHANG ZHEN (China)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  called for strengthened international cooperation in several areas.  Sustainable development was essential and economic and poverty eradication were the basic conditions needing to be fulfilled  with addressing inequality also important.  Economic growth and environmental protection needed addressing in an integrated manner  while development of rural and urban areas should proceed in an integrated way  as settlements were interlinked and complementary.  The gap between the two had to be narrowed in the interest of prosperity.  The international community had to show determination and will to enable developing countries to develop sustainably  through honouring commitments to enhance capacities  and respecting nationally developed policies. JOSHUA MWANGI MUGODO (Kenya)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said it was fundamental that Habitat III “guarantee” that its outcomes were taken within the framework of the sustainable development goals developed in Rio+20 and the Open Working Group.  To prepare for a high rate of urban growth from its current 32 per cent of total population  Kenya had put in place a national organizing committee for Habitat III  and would produce a country report.  Nationally it had provided public-private partnership incentives for low-income housing development and addressed supply-side building constraints.  Kenya looked forward to hosting the second Preparatory Committee for Habitat III  where the agenda would be “people-centred ” focus on global implementation and reporting  and would expand the commitment to improving the quality of human settlements for urban and rural dwellers. RUBÉN IGNACIO ZAMORA RIVAS (El Salvador)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and CELAC  said the Open Working Group had included habitat issues in several of the sustainable development goals.  Among those were Goal 11 on making cities and human settlements inclusive  safe resilient and sustainable; Goal 6 on water and sanitation; Goal 7 on access to energy; and Goal 9 on infrastructure  industrialization and innovation.  His country faced a housing deficiency  was vulnerable to climate change impacts  and had deep-set problems of violence and insecurity.  It had prepared a proposal for a national housing and settlement programme  addressing  among others  the issues of access to housing and basic services  financing  social cohesion  and institutional system and legal framework. YULIA A. PLOKHOVA (Russian Federation) highlighted the increased growth of cities and the need for measures to respond to it.  Her country was prepared to cooperate with the programme  including by sharing its experience in city development.  The level of urbanization in the Russian Federation had reached approximately 74 per cent  and the country was focusing on its population’s housing and infrastructure needs as well as on the well-being of its citizens living in cities.  Habitat III would be an important step in achieving sustainable development  and her country was preparing for its participation in the conference.  It would draft the national project report in December  and it planned to participate in the preparatory committee’s preparation of its outcome document. MICHELLE KLEIN SOLOMON  Permanent Observer for the International Organization for Migration  noted the link between urbanization and migration.  Usually  migration was from rural to urban areas but other links should be considered  too.  Migrants from abroad usually settled in cities  raising questions about delivering services to diverse societies and maintaining social cohesion.  Newcomers to fast-growing cities often settled in hazard-prone  poorly planned areas with limited access to services and were among the worst affected in disasters.  If included in urban development policies and disaster risk reduction strategies  migration could be important as a preventative and response measure to disaster situations. Debt Crisis: Opening remarks SEBASTIANO CARDI (Italy)  Chair  Second Committee (Economic and Financial)  introducing the two afternoon panels on the international debt crisis  pointed to a “new urgency” in tackling sovereign debt after the financial crisis had illustrated the global nature of the problem.  Research into feasibility and configuration of a possible debt workout mechanism was ongoing in various forums.  The Second Committee (Economic and Financial) and Economic and Social Council were well placed to contribute  particularly in light of several General Assembly resolutions calling for intensification of efforts to prevent debt crises.  International dialogues offered the chance to share lessons learned. MARTIN SAJDIK (Austria)  Economic and Social Council President  said addressing debt problems would be important in the post-2015 development agenda  as developed and developing countries suffered from high public debt burdens.  The risk of contagion was a serious threat to international financial stability.  Progress had been made through the debt relief initiatives  such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) programme  but sustainability problems had not been eliminated.  Some States had not benefited at all.  There were differing views on the way forward.  Some States were happy with improved contractual arrangements in bond contracts and a voluntary code of conduct; others called for further policy action on improving the architecture for debt restructuring and a sovereign debt resolution mechanism. Panel I Moderating the first panel  “Lessons learned from policy responses to contagion and debt crises and implications of the changing landscape for debt restructuring”  was Richard Kozul-Wright  Director  Division on Globalization and Development Strategies  United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).  He stressed that international dialogue was needed to establish a more efficient debt resolution mechanism. Panel I included Antonio De Lecea  Principal Advisor for Economic and Financial Affairs  European Union Delegation to the United States; Paulo Nogueira Batista  Executive Director for Northern South America  International Monetary Fund (IMF); and Anna Gelpern  Professor of Law  Georgetown University. Mr. DE LECEA said the Monterrey Consensus had identified the importance of sustainable debt financing.  Low income over-indebted countries had benefited from write-offs through the HIPC and Multilateral Debt Resolution Initiative  which wrote off around $110 billion of debt.  That had allowed them fiscal space to invest  grow and tap into international financial markets for the first time.  That posed its own risks  including the coordination of many bond holders  which had been illustrated through a few “spectacular” litigation events. The European Union’s high degree of economic and financial integration posed its own challenges  which had initially been underestimated  he said.  The financial crisis had created a “perfect storm” prompting crisis management and institutional reform.  The European Union “had to repair the ship in the middle of the storm ” he said  adding that the insertion of Collective Action Clauses with aggregation provisions into new bonds with maturation of over one year was a positive step to combat future problems.  It was also important to reduce the reliance on credit rating agencies and to bear in mind always the financial stability risks posed by restructuring  and not just the legal feasibility.  Prevention was much better than cure and the European Union had also worked to improve governance and surveillance. Mr. BATISTA stressed that he was giving his personal opinions  not those of the IMF.  He noted that the IMF  as a creditor  had faced risks associated with the Argentina litigation and had been following developments closely  if “rather helplessly”.  It had been ready to present an “amicus curiae” brief to the United States Supreme Court in 2013 but intervention of the United States Treasury led to the Fund holding off.  Three individual countries then presented their own amicus briefs.  The Court had refused to consider the Argentine case and lower order decisions prevailed.  Holdouts by “vulture funds” prevented Argentina from paying its debts and that was an unprecedented situation caused by the intervention of the judicial system of one country.  In 2014  the Fund’s executive board had endorsed reform of “pari passu” clauses to clarify that the New York decision was not a global precedent and enhancement of voting on collective action clauses. Reforms remained insufficient  he said  saying the IMF was critical of board members who wished to go into “mission accomplished mode”.  Almost $1 trillion of bonds had weaker collective action clauses or none at all  and States were vulnerable to copycat litigation.  Grenada was suffering from a holdout and  while it may resolve the problem  would do so in the shadow of increased leverage held by speculative investors following the decision against Argentina.  The United Nations had a role to play because of its universality.  Its resolution on a sovereign debt resolution mechanism had passed with a large majority  with only six per cent against.  In the IMF  the unequal distribution of voting power would have meant that the same resolution would have been defeated.  While he was not calling for one-member-one-vote in the IMF  the United Nations played an important balancing role Ms. GELPERN described the legal side of the problem of debt restructuring  calling sovereign debt a “bizarre institution”.  It was the only debt that was not directly enforceable  but was the only kind that never went away.  Assets could not be taken  but nor could Governments go bankrupt and get a fresh start.  Despite its peculiarities  debt was “the lifeblood of the global financial system”.  The Argentina case had highlighted the problem with “foreign law” debt.  Creditors could not force the country to pay but could cause damage to other parties in the system  attempting to create “enforcement by spillover”. She said debt restructuring and management were inter-connected.  The main problems with restructuring were efficiency  fairness and legitimacy.  Efficiency related to the sustainability of the restructuring profile and its timing  with “too little  too late” a common problem of responses.  There was also no single  comprehensive legal process for restructuring.  Furthermore  fragmentation was also an issue that affected efficiency and made it difficult to arrange a fair process  prompting holdouts to wait for better terms.  Outcomes also had to have broad acceptance and legitimacy and the unintelligibility of restructuring processes to people and creditors damaged that.  The lack of involvement of all interested parties harmed its legitimacy.  She called for a modular approach.  Contracts and collective action clauses needed reform  but the approach to those matters should move away from an obsessive focus. In the ensuing discussion  the representative of Belgium questioned where the United Nations should focus its actions.  Mr. BATISTA noted the inability of the official sector to deal with the power of private finance and the need for the official sector  including the United Nations  to alter that balance. Responding to the representative of France  who asked about the concrete meaning of collective action clauses in debt contracts  Mr. DE LECEA said that the case of Greece was a clear example where creditors had prevented restructuring.  Mr. BATISTA added that the IMF solution was aggregating all the series of debt that were eligible for restructuring and holding a single vote of all creditors.  That made it more difficult for vulture funds to buy blocking minorities The representative of Viet Nam asked for further elaboration on who involved in debt restructuring processes had intimate knowledge of their workings.  Responding  Ms GELPERN stressed that there was no “nefarious conspiracy”  with knowledge coming from “repeat play”.  Ten law firms did the bulk of debt restructuring  with three firms responsible for about half.  In those firms  about 10 people were deeply involved in the work.  The Paris Club had established a repository for knowledge  but its increased transparency was a recent development.  Multilaterals working in restructuring were also gaining knowledge in their work. Also taking part in the interactive discussion were representatives of Japan  Ethiopia  and Indonesia. Panel II Moderating the second panel  “Ongoing work on sovereign debt restructuring and debt resolution mechanisms” was Alexander Trepelkov  Director  Financing for Development Office  Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA)  who said that all efforts must be directed at building a robust and resilient financial architecture for sovereign debt restructuring. Panellists included Reza Baqir  Chief  Debt Policies Division  Strategy  Policy and Review Department  IMF; Yuefen Li  Head  Debt and Development Finance Branch  Division on Globalization and Development Strategies  UNCTAD; and Benu Schneider  Senior Economic Affairs Officer  Financing for Development Office  DESA. Mr. BAQIR described the IMF’s work in the area of sovereign debt restructuring  as well as what remained to be done in the coming months and years. The Fund had been working on those issues for some time  proceeding step-by-step due to their complexity.  Concerning the stock problem  IMF intended to brief its Board periodically on the pace of adoption of new contractual provisions  as well as to promote the use of those provisions through its forums  such as a meeting for debt managers from around the world. Focusing on the relationship between sovereign debt restructuring and the funds-lending framework  another strand of work underway at IMF  he said that systemic exemption had been used to allow fund lending without debt restructuring in Greece  despite a high uncertainty of its debt sustainability.  It had been done so due to the risk of contagion on other Eurozone countries.  However  it had represented a “quick fix”  not a coherent  long-term solution.  Lending needed to become more flexible by way of a re-profiling option. Ms. LI said the topic and timing of that meeting could not be more opportune  with an increasing number of least developed countries entering the bond market on the one hand  and the Argentina litigation case on the other.  The international community’s aspirations for efficient  timely and fair debt restructuring must be met  and certain gaps must be filled.  HIPC Debt Initiative countries might still be subject to attacks by vulture funds.  Highlighting the outstanding systemic problems  such as legal forum fragmentation  she noted that a ruling in a New York court might not be accepted in London  and rulings on the same issue might differ between different courts. UNCTAD’s work had been intensified with the offset of the global financial crisis  she said.  In 2013  it had turned its focus to the designing and discussion of debt workout mechanism  a cross-cutting area covering legal  political  economic and social issues.  An inclusive working group had been established  major problems had been identified in facing debt restructuring mechanisms  including those related to creditor coordination  legal forum  procrastination and efficiency.  Also identified were the principles of legitimacy  impartiality  transparency  good faith  standstill and debt sustainability as the basis on which to decide the processes and institutions for debt workout mechanism. Ms. SCHNEIDER said that the DESA project on sovereign debt had tried to foster mutual understanding among different stakeholders in identifying sovereign debt restructuring.  She outlined various restructuring options  depending on the type of debt  including debt to multilaterals  official creditors  commercial banks and bond debt.  For example  debt to commercial banks was covered by the London Club  and there were “no rules of the game” and no oversight body. There was a lot of diversity in sovereign debt restructuring  she said  and its costs were very high.  One of the big achievements of the expert group meeting was that it had led to a greater understanding of problems between the private and official sectors.  For example  they looked at the cost of restructuring and the issue of delay differently.  There was now more ground to find solutions going forward.  She also highlighted the quality of data as important to the debate  and called for a registry of debt to be set up to ensure a timely overview. In the ensuing interactive dialog  the representative of Ecuador commented on the lack of supervision in the international financial system.  People should be prioritized over capital  he said  expressing his belief in societies with markets but not in market societies. Guyana’s representative posed questions about Argentina  and what a “real fix” looked like in terms of effective sovereign debt restructuring mechanism. With CARICOM problems often under the radar  he also enquired about effective responses in situations that were not of systemic importance. The representative of Brazil said that it was important to foresee a follow-up action to the panel discussion. Ms. SCHNEIDER  in response to small economies becoming a target  said that safety clauses could be added to protect them  with work already underway to take care of that problem.  On copycat litigation  she said that it would affect future debt restructuring and strengthen holdout creditors.  There were proposals on the table that addressed an adequate “fix” to debt restructuring  but they must be discussed more extensively. Ms. LI said copycat litigation was a real problem. It was happening and it would happen even more  because the ruling had taken away incentives for debt restructuring.  In response to Brazil’s representative  she said all presentations at the meeting would be available on the UNCTAD website. Mr. BAQIR  in response to Guyana’s representative on whether there was a “real fix”  said that on the IMF Board there was no majority support for a treaty-based approach. The Fund had a lending decision to make. In the meantime  it would continue to use the current policies and legal framework. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-14,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gadis3502.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The development of new technologies of warfare  including autonomous weapons or ”killer robots” and cyberwarfare  raised fundamental concerns about the acceptability of allowing machines to independently take life-and-death decisions  the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) heard today. As States and observers from diverse regions drew attention to new security challenges in the digital age  a representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross said such weapons “must be held to international humanitarian law”.  The unique characteristics and foreseeable impact of new warfare technologies raised questions about whether existing legal rules were sufficiently clear. She said that  although there was no universally accepted definition of an “autonomous weapon system”  common to all proposed definitions was the capability of independently attacking targets without human intervention.  There was a danger that increasing autonomy in the critical functions of weapons systems — to search for  identify  select and attack targets — would substitute human decision-making with that of machines. There was “no doubt”  said Argentina’s representative  about the urgency of addressing the issue of information and communication technologies in the context of security.  Maintaining appropriate levels of security in the “digital universe” was essential for information and communications technologies to achieve their full potential and contribute to economic  social and cultural progress. She said she believed  like others  that the development of the “Internet of things” — the increase of Internet-connected objects and devices — would lead to a doubling of knowledge every 12 hours. Yet despite an increasingly digitized world  Sweden’s representative said his country believed in an approach to disarmament and international security that “puts human beings front and centre of policy”.  The goal was to put in place a global framework of mutually reinforcing and complementary treaties  commitments and institutions to ensure that everyone enjoyed the right to be safe and secure. An observer for the Holy See said the international community should not neglect the broader goal of “building a world less reliant on the use of force”. Greed fuelled arms sales  and those sales in turn fuelled conflicts  which caused “untold suffering and violations of human rights”.  For as long as a high quantity of weapons was in circulation  new grounds could be found to initiate hostilities and perpetrate violence against innocent populations  he warned. Although the work of the First Committee was extremely challenging  he said  the international community must never despair.  Despite stalemates and setbacks  “constant drops of water patiently melting the hardest rock inspire us all to go forward in the midst of slow progress”. Also speaking were representatives of Myanmar  Democratic Republic of the Congo  Eritrea  Armenia  El Salvador  Portugal and Afghanistan. The First Committee will meet again at 3 p.m. on 15 October to conclude its general debate. Background The First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) met this morning to continue its general debate.  For background  see Press Release GA/DIS/3497. Statements MAUNG WAI (Myanmar)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  warned that the weaponization of outer space would lead to an arms race.  The prevention of an arms race was a critical issue on the United Nations disarmament and arms control agenda and one of the four core issues before the Conference on Disarmament.  Myanmar supported calls for the commencement of negotiations on a universal  legally binding instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space.  Further  his delegation would explore the possibility of either co-sponsoring or supporting the draft resolution entitled “No first placement of weapons in outer space”. Continuing to place trust and confidence in the relevancy and validity of the Conference on Disarmament  he said that body had taken some small steps this year through the re-establishment of an informal working group  but that progress was not enough.  However  instead of blaming the Conference  creative solutions should be sought to overcome the status quo.  The Conference was not alone in lacking tangible progress.  Indeed  the United Nations disarmament machinery as a whole had been stagnant.  A fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament would have the authority and legitimacy to comprehensively review the functioning of the entire disarmament machinery. SINBAD MEME (Democratic Republic of the Congo)  associating with the African Union and Non-Aligned Movement  said that the First Committee remained an ideal framework for holding discussions on issues relating to disarmament  peace and security.  At the same time  there was a stalemate in the Conference on Disarmament due to a lack of political will.  Meanwhile  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remained a permanent concern.  Concluding a convention banning nuclear weapons remained an urgent priority.  Such an instrument should address nuclear technologies and their transfer  in a way that allowed peaceful nuclear energy use.  A nuclear weapons ban must follow the path traced by chemical weapons  which had created a momentum of global solidarity  with satisfying results for all. GIRMA ASMEROM TESFAY (Eritrea)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Arab Group  said that international and regional security and disarmament could best be addressed when negotiated multilaterally through transparent  comprehensive and non-discriminatory instruments.  The desire for a shared future and the increasing complexities of international security must compel political will in order to agree on a core agenda and commence substantive discussions.  On conventional weapons  he noted that much of the destruction  instability  underdevelopment  spread of extremism and terrorism in his region were by-products of or exacerbated by the unregulated and illicit movement of small arms and light weapons.  In that regard  he stressed the need to maintain the fundamental elements of the 2001 United Nations Programme of Action. Advancement in science and technology were main drivers of human progress  he said.  As witnessed in recent years  modern technology had the potential to be used for illegal purposes by State and non-State actors alike to undermine the economy and security of nations.  Thus  there was an urgent need to collectively address the use of technology for destructive purposes. TIGRAN SAMVELIAN (Armenia) said that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was an essential foundation for the non-proliferation regime  and upholding its three pillars was more urgent than ever.  Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) was a primary tool to fight the proliferation of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons.  The entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  long overdue  would be decisive towards nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  He regarded the Conventional Weapons Convention and the Mine-Ban Convention as essential tools to eliminate certain categories of weapons  whose use had negative outcomes that far outweighed their military significance. GABRIELA MARTINIC (Argentina)  associating with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) and the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR)  said that “rhetoric must be set aside” on nuclear disarmament in order to achieve the entry into force of the CTBT  the establishment of a Middle East zone free from nuclear weapons  and the start of negotiations on a fissile material ban. She said she believed  like others  that the development of the “Internet of things” would lead to a doubling of knowledge every 12 hours.  As such  there was little doubt about the urgency of addressing the issue of information and communication technologies.  At the same time  the aims of appropriate levels of security in the “digital universe” were essential for information and communications technologies to achieve their full potential  thus contributing to humanity’s economic  social and cultural progress.  She assured the Committee Chair of her delegation’s cooperation and hoped that at the end of the session  Committee members  echoing the words of Bob Marley  would say “everything will be all right”. RUBEN ZAMORA (El Salvador) supported the objective of building a “universal machinery” that would prevent the use of nuclear weapons.  Though his country did not produce those weapons  he knew that their use would have catastrophic consequences.  It was extremely important to support any initiative that sought to eradicate weapons of mass destruction.  Today  more than ever  it was extremely important to strengthen the three pillars of the NPT.  It was a pivotal moment  and he expressed disappointment at the inaction.  Human development and security were complementary  and all people around the world should be able to enjoy their rights and contribute to socioeconomic development.  The illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons fuelled a culture of violence and impunity  and the international community should spare no effort to combat that scourge.  The global problems of development  poverty eradication and the elimination of diseases were all linked to disarmament  and for that reason  he urged the international community to take appropriate measures. MÅRTEN GRUNDITZ (Sweden)  associating with the European Union  said his country believed in an approach to disarmament and international security that “puts human beings front and centre of policy”.  The goal was to put in place an international framework of mutually reinforcing and complementary treaties  commitments and institutions to ensure that everyone enjoyed the right to be safe and secure.  The continued existence of nuclear weapons contravened that approach as they posed an inherent risk to human life on the planet — a risk over which the majority had no say.  While the goal of a nuclear-free world was shared by most  “cold-war postures” remained in place  preventing concrete steps from being made.  Sustainable security was built through cooperation  rather than in isolation against an adversary  he warned. Attaining sustainable safety and security for all reached beyond Earth  he said  explaining that a growing number of human endeavours were dependent on space-based infrastructure.  Those activities were rapidly increasing in scope and had contributed to the development and welfare of societies around the world.  However  the increased use of outer space called for new rules of conduct to ensure that activities were conducted in a sustainable manner  he said. ÁLVARO MENDONÇA E MOURA (Portugal) said the strong  transparent and effective implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty would make a valuable contribution to fostering peace and security  and would have an important humanitarian impact  particularly in regions affected by conflict and extremist threats.  The Treaty would also help to foster dialogue  multilateralism and confidence-building between all relevant actors and improve the international security environment. Portugal maintained a long-standing demand to begin negotiations to enlarge the Conference on Disarmament  he said.  The situation violated the basic non-discrimination required of a multilateral United Nations body.  The Conference remained in an agonizing and frustrating stalemate  and a joint commitment and constructive work were urgently required to overcome it.  Some progress had been achieved this year  which would hopefully encourage further impetus and closer cooperation to succeed in improving the international multilateral mechanisms. ARCHBISHOP BERNARDITO CLEOPAS AUZA  Permanent Observer for the Holy See  said that while the inability of nuclear-weapon States to negotiate reductions in their stockpiles was disturbing  the modernization and proliferation of those arms was even more troubling.  At the same time  the international community should not neglect the broader goal of “building a world less reliant on the use of force”.  The Holy See welcomed progress in the area of conventional weapons  but remained deeply concerned that their flow continued to exacerbate conflicts around the globe.  Greed fuelled arms sales  he reminded the Committee  and those sales in turn fuelled conflicts  which caused “untold suffering and violations of human rights” around the world.  For as long as a high quantity of weapons was in circulation  new grounds could be found to initiate hostilities and perpetrate violence against innocent populations  he warned. He said that  although the work of the First Committee was extremely challenging  the international community must never despair.  Despite stalemates and setbacks  “constant drops of water patiently melting the hardest rock inspire us all to go forward in the midst of slow progress”. KATHLEEN LAWAND  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)  said the threat of nuclear weapons remained a serious concern in humanitarian terms  and it was difficult to envisage how any use of nuclear weapons could be compatible with international humanitarian law.  Evidence of the immediate and long-term effects of their use  including through accidental detonation  made nuclear disarmament a humanitarian imperative. There continued to be much international debate about new technologies of warfare  including autonomous weapons and cyberwarfare  she went on  adding that the development of such weapons was not happening in a legal vacuum.  As with any new weapon  means or method of warfare  weapons use must be held to international humanitarian law  in particular to the principles of distinction  proportionality and precautions in attack.  However  the unique characteristics and foreseeable impact of the new technologies of warfare raised questions about whether existing legal rules were sufficiently clear.  She welcomed the international community’s increased attention to autonomous weapons systems  including in the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. She added that  although there was no universally accepted definition of an “autonomous weapon system”  common to all proposed definitions was the capability of independently attacking targets without human intervention.  There was a danger that increasing autonomy in the critical functions of weapons systems — to search for  identify  select and attack targets — would substitute human decision-making with that of machines.  That posed significant legal and ethical concerns.  Beyond doubts of legal compliance were the fundamental concerns about the ethical and moral acceptability of allowing machines to independently take life-and-death decisions. ZAHIR TANIN (Afghanistan)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that multinational diplomacy was an important principle in advancing international security and was imperative to avoid the use of nuclear weapons.  The only guarantee of the non-use of nuclear weapons was their destruction  he said  urging a binding instrument for their prohibition.  In order to further the objectives of the 2015 NPT Review Conference  his country supported the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East.  Any delay ran contrary to commitments made at the 2010 review.  The entry into force of the CTBT would further reduce the proliferation of those “inhumane” weapons. He said that 2014 was the deadliest year for the Afghan people since 2001.  The use of high-explosive systems by terrorists and the indiscriminate use of improvised explosive devices by extremists groups caused overwhelming loss of life.  Moreover  Afghanistan had been one of the biggest victims of small arms and light weapons use.  Despite progress  challenges arising from the illicit spread of those weapons in conflict and post-conflict regions persisted.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-14,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaab4122.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) today examined the status of construction projects at the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) as well as oversight issues across the United Nations system  including its exposure to fraud risks. Discussions on the first topic centred mainly on the renovation of Africa Hall  the main conference area at the ECA complex in Addis Ababa  Ethiopia  and the proposed establishment of 18 security officer posts for the facility.  (The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions [ACABQ] recommended proceeding to stage three of the five-stage renovation of Africa Hall and approving 14 of the proposed posts.) Bolivia’s delegate  speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  said that the renovation was still in the conceptual and design stages  and the Group was eager to hear reasons for the delay  and receive information on accountability and oversight measures to avoid further delays.  Ethiopia’s delegate welcomed the proposal for 18 more security officers and agreed with the Advisory Committee that the Assembly might wish to authorize the Secretary-General to proceed to the third stage of reconstruction  so development of the detailed design  construction drawings  and tender documentation could begin. The Russian Federation’s delegate noted that the overhaul of Africa Hall would cost $57 million for the period 2015-2021  and urged the Secretary-General to provide his opinion on the establishment of a multi-year special account proposed by the Advisory Committee.  He also said the proposed creation of 18 security officer posts must be carefully studied. Deliberations then turned to issues of oversight and governance of the United Nations  including management of its “implementing partners” — third parties with whom United Nations system organizations signed agreements and allocated resources to implement their programmes and activities. George Bartsiotas  Inspector of the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU)  introducing his body’s report  said that despite the large volume of funds channelled through implementing partners  very few organizations had robust strategies  policies and procedures in place to select and manage those collaborators. He also pointed out that the decentralized environment in which most United Nations system organizations operated was prone to fraud; the Board of Auditors and other oversight bodies had indicated that the fraud reported by United Nations agencies was unusually low.  During the review  the JIU noticed a lack of fraud awareness among staff on the ground  and a lack of anti-fraud training  a finding that concerned him because most fraud cases were exposed through reports by knowledgeable and alert staff. Briefing on the work of Board of Auditors during the biennium 2012-2013  Amyas Morse (United Kingdom)  that body’s Chair  said that management was coming under increasing pressure to demonstrate that Member States’ investment in business transformation was translated into tangible and beneficial change  such as new ways of working  reduced costs  improved productivity  and more cost-effective delivery. Most importantly  he said  constrained resources must reach those who desperately needed them  instead of being locked into administrative overhead.  To strengthen its oversight and governance  the successful implementation of Umoja  the Organization’s enterprise resource planning initiative  was vital.  A realistic plan that took into account uncertainty and risk was necessary to avoid having to continue requesting more funding and further extensions from the General Assembly. The Organization’s regular budget production process  he continued  could be shortened and should reflect future costs  not past ones.  The United Nations also needed a better understanding of its exposure to fraud risks  in particular external ones  across all of its activities  including peacekeeping  global procurement  and humanitarian affairs.  There was a need to develop an integrated counter-fraud strategy  along with clear protocols for staff to follow when fraud cases emerged. Kenneth Herman  Senior Adviser on Information Management Policy Coordination at the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB)  introduced the note transmitting comments of the Secretary-General and the CEB on the JIU’s report. Collen V. Kelapile  Chief of Staff at ECA  introduced the Secretary-General’s report on progress in the construction of additional office facilities there. Carlos G. Ruiz Massieu  ACABQ Chair  introduced his body’s related report.  Also speaking today were the representatives of Togo (on behalf of the African Group)  United Republic of Tanzania  and the European Union.    The Fifth Committee will meet again at 10 a.m.  16 October  to hold a general debate on improving the financial situation of the United Nations. Financial reports and audited statements and reports of Board of Auditors AMYAS MORSE (United Kingdom)  Chair of United Nations Board of Auditors and Comptroller and Auditor General  briefed the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) on his Board’s work during the biennium 2012-2013.  He noted that the Organization’s entities generally had a relatively stable financial position; management  however  faced the challenge of fulfilling the entities’ mandates at a time of unprecedented humanitarian and other crises  amid ongoing fiscal constraint  heightened public scrutiny of spending and other changing environments.  In that context  he continued  business transformation and improvement was vital because United Nations entities could not assume that the same or increased levels of funding would always be available or predictable.  “Resources are finite but mandates are increasing ” he said  noting that the Secretary-General recognized that improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness were “no longer optional”.  The Board acknowledged significant and ongoing improvements in financial management and reporting linked to the implementation of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).  However  it had also seen management coming under increasing pressure to demonstrate that Member States’ investment in business transformation was translated into tangible and beneficial change  such as new way of working  reduced costs  improved productivity  and more cost-effective delivery. Most importantly  he said  it was vital that increasingly constrained resources got to those who desperately needed them  and they were not locked into administrative overhead  entrenched methods of operating or inflexible structures.  The Board’s current reports carried a strong theme on the need for improved management of implementing partners in global operations  and the need for robust selection and monitoring processes.  The Board considered that the successful implementation of Umoja  the Organization’s enterprise resource planning initiative  was vital  he said.  To get value from future spend and arrive at a positive position  management must invest much more in business readiness prior to Umoja’s future roll-out.  Also  it must plan realistically by providing Member States with the best estimate of what the implementation of full functionality would entail.  The plans should include time and cost provisions for uncertainty and risk  to avoid having to continue requesting more funding and further extensions from the General Assembly.  The Administration must clarify the accountability of each Under-Secretary-General and head of business unit for the changes that needed to occur. The regular budget production process could be streamlined as it took too long and was not built on a good understanding of the real costs of delivering mandates  he argued.  Due to a lack of that understanding by management  the budget always reflected what it had cost in the past  not what it should or would cost in the future.  The United Nations also needed a better understanding of the fraud risks it faced  in particular external fraud risks  across all of its activities  including peacekeeping  global procurement and humanitarian affairs.  There was a need to develop a strategic and integrated counter-fraud strategy  along with clear protocols for staff to follow when fraud cases emerged. The representatives of Bolivia  speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  and of the European Union Delegation and the United Republic of Tanzania stressed the importance of the Board’s work in improving the governance of the United Nations  and expressed its readiness to study and discuss its reports. Mr. MORSE said he was very grateful for the positive comments.  The Board tried to tread a line between what was practical in such a broad Organization with many independent elements and the need  in the current environment  for the United Nations to carry out its enormous responsibilities  in a cost-effective and efficient manner. GEORGE A. BARTSIOTAS  Inspector of the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU)  introduced the Unit’s report titled “Review of the management of implementing partners in United Nations system organizations” (document A/69/378).  The report provided a review of the methods and processes that the United Nations  its funds and programmes and specialized agencies used to select and manage their implementing partners.  It identified common challenges  explored areas for improvement and made recommendations.  Implementing partners — third parties with whom organizations sealed agreements and allocated resources to implement their programmes and activities — could include host Government entities  non-governmental organizations or civil society.  In some organizations  more than half of the annual budget was spent through them. The review found that  despite the large volume of funds channelled through implementing partners and their important role in delivering United Nations programmes  very few organizations had robust strategies  policies and procedures in place to select and manage their partners  he said.  Compliance with policies and procedures was not always consistent.  There were positive trends  however  with organizations making concerted efforts to improve the management of implementing partners by strengthening due diligence mechanisms  and updating their policies and procedures.  Some of the recommendations highlighted in the JIU report included the need for a strategic approach in engaging with partners; in-depth assessments of the implementing partner; strong  legal agreements that included important provisions  such as anti-fraud clauses; the need for robust and effective monitoring of projects. In addition  he said  the decentralized environment in which most United Nations system organizations operated was prone to fraud  and the Auditors’ Board and other oversight bodies had indicated that the fraud reported by United Nations agencies was unusually low.  During the review  the JIU noticed a lack of fraud awareness among staff on the ground  and lack of anti-fraud training.  That was an area of concern because  usually  most fraud cases were exposed through reports by knowledgeable and alert staff. Other areas of concern were the fragmentation of data as information was dispersed among many offices and automations systems  and the insufficient sharing of information on the partners among the United Nations organizations  he said. “No consultation precedes the signing of partners’ agreements  and there are reported cases of no information sharing among organizations  even on partners with poor performance record ” he said.  “This lack of information among UN peers is a major barrier to fraud detection.”  The report recommends that organizations establish operational procedures for sharing partner information on the ground. Mr. Bartsiotas said it was time for the Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) to address the issue of implementing partners.  In response to the JIU recommendation to include this topic in the CEB agenda  CEB members had stated they did not see the need for regular discussions on this topic  but only on an occasional basis and as required.  “The evidence  however  and our report findings argue that the time for the CEB to address implementing partners is now ” he said. KENNETH HERMAN  Senior Adviser on Information Management Policy Coordination at the CEB  introduced the note by the Secretary-General (document A/69/378/Add.1) transmitting his comments and those of the CEB on the JIU report.  He said the agencies welcomed  without reservation  many of the recommendations; for example  full agreeing with recommendation 6  to strengthen the implementing partner agreements in order to safeguard their interests  as well as recommendation 8  which urges training for fraud prevention and awareness.  In other cases  agencies agreed with the overall substance of the recommendations but were concerned regarding their implementation  he said.  For example  regarding the importance of assessing implementing partners  found in recommendation 4  the agencies agreed with the need for assessments.  But they suggested the various shapes and sizes of partners meant it may not be possible  or prudent  to perform an assessment aimed at establishing capacity  weaknesses  and risks.  The agencies also noted that training  studies  and tracking within automated systems  required investment  and resources were increasingly difficult to identify. Construction and Property Management at Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) COLLEN V. KELAPILE  Chief of Staff and Officer-in-Charge  Division of Administration  Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)  introduced the report of the Secretary-General on Progress in the construction of additional office facilities at the Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa  proposals for the renovation of conference facilities  including Africa Hall  and revised estimates relating to the programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015 under section 18  Economic and social development in Africa  section 33  Construction  alteration  improvement and major maintenance  and section 34  Safety and security (document A/69/359). He said that the construction of the new office facility was substantially completed on 19 June 2014  with the premises already fully occupied by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS)  United Nations Office to the African Union/United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID)  World Health Organization (WHO)  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Liaison Office to the African Union and ECA  and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).  Ancillary projects  including construction of internal access roads  parking upgrades  civil and landscaping works  permanent lighting  final sanitary works  and some interior finishes  were scheduled to be completed by the end of 2015. The remaining works for the renovation of conference facilities  including creation of access for persons with disability  would be completed in 2016/2017.  Regarding the Africa Hall  which was inaugurated in 1961 as a gift from Ethiopia  the first two of the five stages for renovation had been completed.  The remaining phases would cost nearly $57 million over a period of seven years. CARLOS G. RUIZ MASSIEU  Chair of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ)  introduced the Advisory Committee’s related report (document A/69/415).  ACABQ welcomed the substantial completion of the new office facility and its full occupancy by August 2014.  In view of existing capacity  the Advisory Committee also recommended that the Assembly approve the establishment of 14 of the 18 additional security officer posts  proposed to handle the increased workload resulting from the facility’s addition to the ECA complex. Regarding the renovation of the Africa Hall Building  the Advisory Committee recommended the Assembly proceed to stage 3 and approve additional resources for the development of the detailed design and tender documentation  he said.  It recommended the Assembly ask the Secretary-General  in his next progress report  to provide detailed cost estimates for each phase of the project.  It also recommended that the estimates for increased costs and contingency funds for the renovation project should be estimated and managed in accordance with previous recommendations on construction projects. DAYANA ANGELA RIOS REQUENA (Bolivia)  speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  stressed the need to ensure the timely and full completion of the remaining ancillary work  and to avoid further delay and a possible cost overrun.  Taking note that  as of August  the new facilities hosted 685 staff — more than the planned 647 — she sought detailed clarification on elements of cost-recovery arrangements on services provided to the occupying entities.  The Africa Hall renovation was still at the conceptual and design stages  and the Group was eager to hear reasons for the delay  and receive information on accountability and oversight measures to avoid further delays.  The Group urged the Secretary-General once again to take all necessary steps to complete the project on time and within the budget.         KODJOVI DOSSEH (Togo)  speaking on behalf of the African Group  aligned himself with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China  and commended the Government of Ethiopia for its support of the implementation of those important projects.  The construction of additional office facilities  the renovation of conference spaces and Africa Hall were of major interest to the Group.  He welcomed the progress on those projects and urged the Secretary-General to ensure they were completed in their entirety.  He stressed the importance of drawing upon the lessons learned during those construction projects  including the Capital Master Plan.  Regarding the renovation of Africa Hall  the Group supported strict compliance with the highest international standards.  It supported efforts to increase the use of conference rooms. AMAN HASSEN BAME (Ethiopia) aligned his country with the statements made by Bolivia  on behalf of the Group of 77 and China  and with Togo  on behalf of the African Group.  He noted the successful completion of the construction of the additional office facilities in June 2014  and the premises’ full occupancy by August 2014.  The additional office facilities comprised a seven-story building which could accommodate 685 occupants  and he welcomed the proposal for 18 more security officers. Turning to the renovation of conference facilities  including the Africa Hall  he said the Hall was one of Addis Ababa’s landmarks and had hosted numerous high-level meetings  and had been the site of historic decisions.  The consultant’s assessment of the structure revealed deterioration and numerous deficiencies  which had to be urgently addressed if the building was to remain safe and functional.   Ethiopia agreed with the Advisory Committee that the Assembly might wish to authorize the Secretary-General to proceed to the third stage of reconstruction  so development of the detailed design  construction drawings  and tender documentation could begin according to plan. Work on the structure was expected to take about seven years  from 2015 to 2021  and the cost for the renovation of the Hall  its adjunct visitor areas  andassociated security enhancements was estimated at nearly $57 million.  He repeated the Ethiopian Government’s assurance to provide guaranteed access for the import of all materials and any other measures needed to smooth the project’s implementation. EVGENY V. KALUGIN (Russian Federation) noted that ACABQ recommended that the Assembly ask the Secretary-General to ensure that the remaining ancillary work be fully completed on time.  The Secretary-General’s request to create 18 security officer posts must be carefully studied.  Renovating Africa Hall would cost $57 million over the next seven years.  That plan must be carefully examined as well.  His delegation asked the Secretary-General to comment on the proposal by ACABQ for a multi–year special account for renovating the Hall. JUSTIN KISOKA (United Republic of Tanzania) said the poor quality of the video telecommunications services at the ECA offices had been discussed at previous meetings.  He also noted the poor quality of the presentation made today. He was not sure if the technical problem was occurring in New York or in Addis Ababa.  He hoped the issue would be corrected during the renovation. Mr. KELAPILE  speaking via video conference from Addis Ababa  said the Commission was working on correcting various technology issues  not just malfunctioning video telecommunications services.  He agreed fully that those technical issues had to be corrected.  Budget restrictions had reduced travel to New York Headquarters and increased dependence on video-conferencing services. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-13,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaef3398.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Disorderly restructuring of sovereign debt could lead to costly socializing of private debt  attendant economic distress and significant human suffering  the Second Committee (Economic and Financial) heard today as delegates met to discuss external debt sustainability and development. Richard Kozul-Wright  Director of the Division on Globalization and Development of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  described how recent litigation by bondholder holdouts against Argentina “led to intensified international debate on the need for a robust mechanism to improve efficiency  fairness and coordination in sovereign debt restructuring”. Calling for vulture funds to be stopped from paralysing debt restructuring efforts  Argentina’s representative welcomed the General Assembly decision to establish a multilateral framework on sovereign debt restructuring  which met the needs of many countries that had been affected by gaps in regulation of the international financial system. Several delegates also expressed their concern about vulture funds.  Bolivia’s representative noted that they hampered future debt-restructuring processes and should never supersede a State’s right to protect its people.  Sharing his view  El Salvador’s representative stressed the importance of preventing such funds from paralysing development efforts. Highlighting that debt relief and restructuring was not the only route  the representative of the United States called upon countries to adopt effective debt management strategies and manage their borrowing and lending.  She did not support the establishment of the sovereign debt reduction mechanism called for by some  nor did she support a super national mechanism to override the terms in existing bond contracts. The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) were discussed by several delegates.  Ethiopia’s representative said that drawing on those initiatives  his country’s debt position had become sustainable.  However  some bilateral and commercial creditors did not accept the principle of the enhanced HIPC due to a lack of an instrument that obliged them to abide by it.  Therefore  such a mechanism should be established.  Expressing similarly mixed experience  the representative of Bangladesh noted that despite the benefits that some of the least developed countries had derived from those initiatives  many HIPCs continued to be at risk of debt distress. Jamaica’s representative highlighted that the middle-income country status of many Caribbean States constrained their ability to access concessionary financing  and prevented them from benefiting from the HIPC or MDRI initiatives.  Non-HIPC’s facing insurmountable debt distress needed international assistance and a new measure of development going beyond gross domestic product (GDP) had to be created. Despite its high debt burden and eligibility for HIPC and MDRI  said Sudan’s representative  his country had been prevented from taking advantage of preferential treatment due to sanctions that kept it out of the HIPC initiative and other sources of financing.  Greater attention must be paid to countries emerging from conflict and others in special situations  he said. The Committee also discussed information and communications technology (ICT) for development.  Dong Wu  Chief of the UNCTAD Science and Technology Section  said the 10-year review of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS+10) offered a chance to take stock of progress and gaps to contribute to full attainment of goals and harnessing ICT for the benefit of society.  Also introducing the report “Communications for Development in the United Nations System” was Ricardo de Guimarães Pinto  Liaison Officer for the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Several delegates were concerned about the continuing digital divide between developed and developing countries.  India’s representative noted that almost 90 per cent of those without Internet access were in developing countries.  Moreover  the representative of Costa Rica was concerned about the substantial differences in broadband access  availability and affordability between developed and developing countries.  In that regard  it was important to ensure that the benefits of new technologies were available to all  he said. Speaking on debt sustainability were representatives of Costa Rica (on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC))  Brazil  Algeria  Nicaragua  China  Russian Federation  Iran  Zambia and South Africa. Speaking on ICT were representatives of Bolivia (on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China)  Trinidad and Tobago (on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM))  European Union  Brunei Darussalam (on behalf of the Association of the South East Asian Nations(ASEAN))  Brazil  Israel  Russian Federation  United States  Sri Lanka  Azerbaijan  Algeria  Belarus  Zimbabwe  Japan  Thailand  Morocco  Bahrain  China  Côte d’Ivoire  Iran  Dominican Republic and Zambia. Representatives of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)  and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) also spoke. The Committee will meet again at 10 a.m.  on 14 October to consider Item 20 of its agenda:  Implementation of the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) and strengthening of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat). Macroeconomic policy questions: External debt Sustainability and Development The Second Committee (Economic and Financial) met this morning to consider macroeconomic policy questions.  Before it was a report of the Secretary-General on “External debt sustainability and development” (document A/69/167). Introduction of Reports RICHARD KOZUL-WRIGHT  Director of the Division on Globalization and Development of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  said maintaining sovereign debt was “not only fundamental for a country’s capacity to finance national development strategies  it is also central to ensuring a stable macroeconomic environment conducive to robust economic growth and sustainable development”.  In developing countries  debt stocks were rising at above average rates and debt rations were worsening despite export growth improvements.  Many such countries had begun to issue bonds  as they could do so at a lower interest rate compared to domestic borrowing.  The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) relieved poor countries in debt distress  enabling more poverty reduction resources  though most HIPCs remained off-course in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  Lessons from the initiatives had to be learned and new challenges tackled  notably the need to assist non-HIPCs in debt distress. He described how recent litigation by bondholder holdouts against Argentina “led to intensified international debate on the need for a robust mechanism to improve efficiency  fairness and coordination in sovereign debt restructuring”  noting that disorderly restructuring could lead to costly socializing of private debt  attendant economic distress and significant human suffering.  Litigation against Argentina had also highlighted the issue of legal-forum-fragmentation  where different courts interpreted identical clauses differently  producing divergent rulings.  The result was “greater incoherence and unpredictability in debt restructuring”  making future debt restructuring more difficult as debtors were “left with only moral suasion and diplomatic relations as the means to encourage creditor coordination”.  With existing procedures characterized by procrastination  there was a need for an international mechanism to coordinate debt crisis resolution.  The Assembly had recognized the need to design a debt workout mechanism and discussions were needed to ensure its legitimacy and economic effectiveness.  “It is time for the international community to come together to find a solution ” he said. Statements SACHA LLORENTI (Bolivia)  speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  said questions of international trade  reform of the financial system  global economic governance and debt were crucial to pursuing development objectives.  International financial institutions needed reform and a global mechanism was needed to provide resources for market stabilization in the event of crisis.  Developing countries needed equitable representation and a voice in global economic governance  while transparency and regulation was needed in the financial sector.  Capital markets needed to play a greater role in development  as did international trade.  It was essential to establish and uphold a universal  fair  rules-based  open  pro-development  non-discriminatory  inclusive and equitable multilateral trading system  with the World Trade Organization (WTO) helping developing countries find ways to boost economic and social development.  All subsidies needed immediate elimination  especially those connected to agriculture. The international financial architecture had major gaps in its ability to provide timely  effective solutions to sovereign debt distress  he said.  Sustainability  effective management and the guarantee of adequate repayment capacities were essential to the development efforts of States.  The emergence of vulture funds was a concern.  Their highly speculative nature and the systemic implications of their actions hampered future debt-restructuring processes for developing and developed countries.  They should not be allowed to paralyse debt-restructuring efforts and should never supersede the right of a State to protect its people.  Agreements reached between debtors and creditors within the context of sovereign debt restructuring processes had to be respected and adoption of General Assembly resolution 68/304 was welcome  particularly its aim to negotiate the establishment of a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes. JUAN CARLOS MENDOZA-GARCÍA (Costa Rica)  speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  said the issue of debt sustainability was essential for underpinning growth.  Both debt sustainability and effective debt management  as well as the determination of adequate debt repayment capacity that did not impair sustainable development perspectives  were core factors to be considered in Member States’ efforts to attain national and international development goals.  Past resolutions had stressed the need to address systemic fragilities and imbalances  and to reform and strengthen the international financial system.  They had also reaffirmed that multilateral institutions  including entities within the United Nations system  played an important role in assisting countries in achieving and maintaining debt sustainability. He said that the adoption of sound practices in the management and governance of sovereign debt was crucial to the promotion of economic growth and development through sustainable and good-quality finance.  The global sovereign debt system needed to be harmonized as sovereign debt crisis resolution was governed by loose networks and ad hoc arrangements.  He recognized the importance of a timely  effective  comprehensive and durable solution to debt problems  and underscored that progress had been made through debt relief programmes to poor countries  including through the HIPC Debt Initiative and the MDRI.  He welcomed General Assembly resolution 68/304  entitled “Towards a multilateral convention to establish a legal regulatory framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes”. COURTENAY RATTRAY (Jamaica)  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  CELAC and Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS)  noted that the report highlighted the challenge posed by unsustainable debt burdens in his region.  The most severely indebted countries held debt to gross domestic product (GDP) ratios in excess of 100 per cent.  Debt servicing outstripped health and education spending  illustrating its far-reaching implications for socioeconomic development.  Though the sovereign debt crisis in the Caribbean had deepened over the previous decade  it remained “a silent crisis”  attracting a level of attention not in keeping with its magnitude.  The middle-income country status of many Caribbean States constrained their ability to access concessionary financing and the region had not benefited from the HIPC Debt Initiative or the MDRI. Non-HIPC’s facing insurmountable debt distress needed international assistance and a new measure of development going beyond GDP had to be found  he said.  The current measure did not account for particular vulnerabilities or the reality of the situation on the ground.  For example  in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  a few hours of rain had wiped out 17 per cent of the country’s GDP.  CARICOM leaders had agreed on the need for debt sustainability to tackle development.  A regional debt management mechanism and a CARICOM debt advocacy team were being established to ameliorate the debt situation in the region.  There could be no sustainable development without reduced indebtedness  and debt reduction had to be part of the outcome of the upcoming meeting on Financing for Development.  The inclusion of a target on debt sustainability in the development goals was welcome  as was the aim to tackle debt sustainability and management in the post-2015 agenda.  A HIPC initiative focused specifically on small island developing States was needed and he praised adoption of General Assembly resolution 68/304. ABULKALAM ABDUL MOMEN (Bangladesh)  speaking on behalf of the Group of Least Developed Countries  and associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said the international community must address the Ebola crisis and its impacts  among others  through debt service moratorium and a subsequent full debt cancellation for Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone.  Despite numerous initiatives  the external debt and debt-servicing obligation of the least developed countries continued to grow.  In 2013  the outstanding debt of the 48 such countries had increased by $16.8 billion or 9.5 per cent compared with 2012.  The debt to GDP ratio had increased from 25.5 per cent to 26.5 per cent  and the ratio of total debt as a percentage of exports had increased from 87.1 per cent to 89.4 per cent.  For many of them  the accumulated debt burden had become a drawback for financing their development. He recognized the benefits that some least developed countries had derived from the MDRI and HIPC initiatives.  However  many HIPCs continued to be at risk of debt distress despite completing the Initiative.  Getting full debt relief from all creditors remained a big challenge  and the non-Paris Club official bilateral creditors and commercial creditors — together accounting for about 26 per cent of total HIPC Initiative costs — had only delivered a small share of their expected relief.  If a country fulfilled the criteria of being a least developed country  it should be eligible for debt write-off  he said  urging the international community to write off all outstanding debt  both multilateral and bilateral  of all such countries immediately. GUILHERME DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  as well as CELAC  said that debt-restructuring had crucial implications for the stability and fairness of the international financial system  as much as for the future implementation of the post-2015 development agenda.  The existing architecture for dealing with debt restructuring was not sustainable and encouraged short-term speculation against sovereign countries.  That created instability and risk for the system as a whole.  If left unchecked  the model would completely remove any risk for private holders of debt  while subjecting sovereign States to unreasonable sacrifices often due to conditions beyond their control  and wiping out development opportunities for generations to come.  A fair and equitable  multilateral  debt-restructuring legal framework should be part of the enabling environment that was required to provide developing countries with the policy space they needed. MARÍA CRISTINA PERCEVAL (Argentina)  associating herself the Group of 77 and China  as well as CELAC  underscored the challenge posed to development  economic growth and poverty eradication by external debt.  Debt also limited the capacity of States to create conditions for human rights.  She described how vulture funds purchased sovereign debt for the purpose of launching legal action against debtors in order to turn large profits  and criticized the highly speculative nature of such activity  noting the risk it posed to future debt restructuring processes for developed and developing countries.  Vulture funds had to be stopped from paralysing debt restructuring efforts  she said  welcoming the General Assembly decisions to establish a multilateral framework on sovereign debt-restructuring  one which met the needs of many countries that had been affected by gaps in regulation of the international financial system.  An international legal framework would be established to resolve debt distress  establishing clear rules that met the needs of both creditors and debtors.  The current “legal void” benefited “a few speculators to the detriment of all countries”.  The Human Rights Council had noted the human rights element of debt distress  and she shared the view that debt hindered sustainable development and the right to development. KHALED BENHAMADI (Algeria)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  noted that total debt stocks in the Middle East and North Africa grew 9 per cent in 2013  with a debt ratio soaring by 3 per cent.  While growth in the region was projected to improve in the short-term  the outlook would be weakened by the ongoing political uncertainties.  Also troublesome was the 5.6 per cent decrease in official development assistance (ODA) to Africa.  In the spirit of solidarity and development cooperation  his Government had cancelled $1.4 billion in bilateral debts with 14 developing countries since 2012.  For its part  Algeria revised its foreign debt policy to reduce external borrowing in 1999  and today its debt levels hit an all-time low  with the debt to GDP ratio at 1.5 per cent.  Learning from its own debt restructuring  his country had advocated for a profound reform of the international financial system.  The Argentina v. NML Capital  Ltd case attested to the need for an international debt restricting mechanism to address the current legal void.  In that context  his Government supported the Secretary-General’s proposal to adopt a set of sound practices in the management and governance of sovereign debt. JAIME HERMIDA CASTILLO (Nicaragua)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  as well as CELAC  said that poverty eradication and sustainable development could only be achieved through economic growth and social inclusion.  He called for a change in the existing model  and welcomed the statement made by Argentina.  The international community must prioritize the debt situation in developing countries  particularly in those least developed.  The external debt situation needed to be tackled  given its social impact  and the post-2015 agenda must help developing countries achieve debt sustainability in the long-term.  He expressed his support for the Group of 77 sovereign debt restructuring resolution  and urged States to work together to set up the legal framework for debt restructuring in line with it. AMAN HASSEN (Ethiopia)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  Group of Least Developed Countries and African Group  stressed the importance of the HIPC Debt Initiative and the MDRI Initiative  which could redirect resources to poverty-reducing and other sustainable development activities.  Ethiopia had just finished preparation to sell its sovereign bonds in international markets for the first time.  In that regard  he noted that the harmonization of global sovereign debt helped address current fragmentations and ad hoc arrangements surrounding the debt system.  Drawing on the HIPC and MDRI initiatives  Ethiopia’s debt position had become sustainable since the 2004/2005 period  and the country now maintained sustainability through concessional loans for strategic infrastructure projects.  One notable challenge was that some bilateral and commercial creditors did not accept the principle of the enhanced HIPC due to the lack of an instrument that obliged them to abide by it.  A mechanism must be established.  Ethiopia’s investment needs continued to grow following more than a decade of double-digit economic growth  he said  requesting bilateral countries and multilateral financial institutions to provide additional concessional loans.  The Third International Conference on Financing for Development  to be held in his country in 2015  could serve as a platform to chart out steps to address development challenges. TERRI ROBL (United States) said her country had given substantial debt relief to developing countries in debt distress  including over 350 projects through the Paris Club and $75 billion in support through the HIPC Debt Initiative.  Debt relief and restructuring was not the only route and she called on countries to adopt effective debt management strategies  and to manage their borrowing and lending.  There were many new sources of financing available to developing countries with a complex array of lending conditions.  That highlighted the need for debt management  so the United States supported building of debt management capacities.  The approach should be Government-wide  with central responsibility for management and clear documentation of debt management.  She did not support establishment of the sovereign debt reduction mechanism called for by some.  There were considerable technical challenges and a poorly designed mechanism could create uncertainty that would stifle financing.  Nor did she support a super national mechanism to override the terms in existing bond contracts.  The International Capital Markets Association had developed model bond clauses that some nations were now using. RUBÉN IGNACIO ZAMORA RIVAS (El Salvador)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  as well as CELAC  pointed to worsening debt indicators for developing countries thanks to slow economic growth.  External debt could hugely impact social development in developing countries  since the share of money going to improving quality of life was reduced in favour of servicing debt burdens.  The HIPC and MDRI had improved things but a “true solution” was needed.  The situation in Argentina had brought about efforts to establish a debt-workout mechanism.  There was a need to improve effectiveness and coordination of debt restructuring internationally.  Debt problems needed to be resolved in a development-oriented manner.  Vulture funds’ activities in international courts highlighted the risk they posed  and it was important to prevent such funds from paralyzing development efforts.  The sovereign debt resolution mechanism was a positive development and he looked forward to discussion of the modalities. CHEN YING ZHU (China)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  said that after the crisis  the debt issue of developing countries had become more prominent  with the total external debt stocks of those countries reaching $6 trillion in 2013.  Developed countries as major creditors should act on their commitments to debt relief and further their assistance of developing countries  as well as carry out responsible macroeconomic policies.  The international financial institutions should also increase their financial support and technical assistance to developing countries.  China regarded foreign assistance as its international obligation  and paid close attention to recipient countries’ debt sustainability.  It used bilateral channels to ease debt burdens of those countries as much as possible  and had  as of 2013  signed debt forgiveness agreements with more than 50 countries. DMITRY I. MAKSIMYCHEV (Russian Federation) expressed his concern about continuing growth in the total outstanding debt of developing countries  which had hampered the ability of those States to achieve sustainable development.  Over the last 14 years  the Russian Federation had restructured the debt owed to it by foreign States.  The resources that became available as a result of such debt write-offs could and should be directed towards poverty eradication and the achievement of sustainable development goals.  The sovereign debt restructuring issue and the recent debt crisis had shown that serious gaps remained in the existing system of regulating the debt obligations of States.  In that context  his country supported the adoption of the General Assembly resolution to develop a multinational legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring. MAHMOUD ABBAS  Minister for Finance and Economy of Sudan  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Group of Least Developed Countries  said that external debt concerned his country in particular.  Noting the challenges posed by debt  he welcomed the call for implementation of the Rio+20 outcomes and stressed the need for full implementation of the sustainable development goals.  Sudan faced unilateral economic sanctions as well as a high debt burden.  Debt was hampering the country’s capacities and constraining the economy.  Growth and production had reduced  while debt was also preventing enjoyment of ODA and other forms of investment and assistance.  Despite Sudan’s eligibility for HIPC and MDRI  his country was prevented from joining. He noted that in 2012  despite extremely high growth  debt servicing had absorbed the majority of income.  Without it  his Government could have pursued development and the eradication of poverty.  The situation had worsened because Sudan was prevented from taking advantage of preferential treatment through sanctions that kept the country out of the HIPC initiative and other sources of financing.  Sanctions had also harmed agriculture  increasing trade costs and burdening the poor as well as the Government.  Greater attention needed to be paid to countries emerging from conflict and other States in special situations.  Sudan was paying a “heavy price” for achieving peace  having lost South Sudan and the oil reserves it possessed.  He called for international support in cancelling debt and removing sanctions. TAGHI MOHAMMAD POUR FERAMI (Iran)  speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China  welcomed the adoption of resolution 68/304  “Towards the establishment of a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes”  which aimed to create a framework through intergovernmental consultations.  Addressing other delegations’ concerns that such a framework could create uncertainty in financial markets and was being discussed in other financial forums  he said the normative gap in the current financial system was an undeniable fact.  In addition  the United Nations was the most representative international forum and the Assembly was the most democratic forum  as all Member States received an equal footing.  The positive outcomes of other forums could be used in the Assembly’s intergovernmental consultations.  Based on those points  his country maintained it was time to provide the international financial system with a legal framework that addressed the concerns of debtors and recipients as it monitored  and possibly restructured  sovereign debt. ELIPHAS CHINYONGA (Zambia) said that his country’s total external debt at the end of June 2014 increased by 29.7 per cent  up to $4.55 billion  from $3.51 billion at the end of 2013.  The primary factor was the issuance of $1 billion in Eurobonds  which made up 17.6 per cent of the country’s GDP.  In terms of debt service  $98.91 million had been paid to various creditors  including the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  That total included $63.28 million for principal  $30.50 million in interest payments and another $5.12 million in other charges.  The debt increase was needed to finance key infrastructure projects  primarily in the energy and transport sectors  which were essential for private sector investment in the economy. He said that Zambia’s debt remained below the debt sustainability threshold of 40 per cent of GDP.  The 2013 joint IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries showed Zambia’s risk of external debt distress remained low  as all debt sustainability indicators were below policy thresholds for the 2013-2033 period.  To expand its revenue base  his country would continue to diversify its economy and encourage investments that boosted productivity while improving compliance and the efficiency of its tax system. SHELDON MOULTON (South Africa) said developing countries could not grow with unsustainable debt looming over their economies and the actions of speculators  particularly vulture funds  created a risk to those countries’ debt restructuring and debt sustainability.  There was a need for a more transparent credit rating system with oversight mechanisms that accounted for the needs of developing countries.  It recognized the work of UNCTAD on “Principles on Promoting Responsible Sovereign Lending and Borrowing”  which aimed to fill the legal and institutional void to benefit sovereign lenders and borrowers.  His country was concerned about the total external debt of the least developed countries  which totalled $16.8 billion in 2013  up 9.5 per cent since 2012.  South Africa would advocate for the forgiveness of debt for those countries and supported the writing-off of debt for African countries through the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD)  under its capital flows initiative.  It was disturbed that even though ODA had increased by 6.1 per cent in 2013  after two consecutive years of decline  aid to Africa had decreased by 5.6 per cent in 2013. Information and Communications Technologies for Development Introduction of Reports DONG WU  Chief  Science and Technology Section  UNCTAD  presented a report on “Progress made in the implementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society at the regional and international levels”.  That report detailed the main trends and developments in the deployment of information and communications technologies.  She went on to highlight some activities related to the Summit that took place in 2013 and 2014.  Discussing developments related to the WSIS+10 review  she said the review had to consider inclusive development centred upon the information society  adding that it offered a chance to take stock of progress and gaps in order to contribute to full attainment of goals and harnessing information and communications technology (ICT) for the full benefit of society. RICARDO DE GUIMARÃES PINTO  Liaison Officer  United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  introduced the report “Communications for Development in the United Nations System”  noting that it stressed the importance of freedom of expression  particularly freedom of press and information  in promoting sustainable development.  The UNESCO General Conference had passed a resolution highlighting the importance of promoting freedom of expression  universal access to knowledge and its preservation  and free  pluralistic and independent media  both on- and offline.  There were three positive trends related to ICT  which were:  the importance of community radio and recognition of its role alongside public and private; the need for assistance for media development through  for example  UNESCO’s Inter-Governmental Programme for the Development of Communication; and strengthened United Nations system collaboration. Statements SACHA LLORENTI (Bolivia)  speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China  stressed the importance of ICT for achieving the internationally agreed upon development goals.  The role of those technologies had been highlighted in the outcome documents of major United Nations conferences.  They were vital for developing countries to fully participate in the global economy and held tremendous potential for the eradication of poverty and promotion of socioeconomic development.  A greater emphasis should be placed on reducing the cost of such technologies  including that of broadband connections  and on capacity-building for greater use and application in the developing world.  The Group was concerned about the continuing digital divide between developed and developing countries. Recalling that the United Nations resolution adopted in July 2014  titled “Modalities for the overall review by the General Assembly of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society”  he said the Group reaffirmed that the 193-nation body was a multilateral body  not a multi-stakeholder body  and successfully resisted any attempts to change that character.  The Group hoped that the Assembly’s review would take stock of the progress made since the 2005 World Summit and address potential gap areas.  The review should examine not just inputs from the Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD)  but other relevant submissions  including those from member and observer states of the Assembly. EDEN CHARLES (Trinidad and Tobago)  speaking on behalf of CARICOM  and associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  as well as CELAC  welcomed the progress made in implementing the World Summit on the Information Society action areas at the regional and international levels.  He agreed with the observations made in the Secretary-General’s report that  even though ICT demand and supply had continued to grow  challenges remained in relation to access  affordability and quality in large portions of the developing world.  He also agreed with the report’s recommendation that the WSIS+10 Review must inform the post-2015 development agenda on the complex connections between ICT and sustainable development. CARICOM Governments had undertaken to make the region a single ICT space  he said  noting that further work was required  particularly on the continued liberalization of the telecommunications sector.  The region had established an ICT for development programme along with a Regional Digital Development Strategy.  However  major challenges persisted in mobilizing resources for investment in new technologies  particularly in the area of small and micro enterprise development  as well as in addressing the emerging issue of cybercrime.  Moreover  as a region of small island developing States  vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters  CARICOM saw the environment sector as a key area for further development and dissemination of ICT  contributing to its regional resilience building efforts. JUAN CARLOS MENDOZA-GARCÍA  speaking on behalf of CELAC  said that ICT were essential enablers for meeting the Millennium Development Goals and the sustainable development goals  and for the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda.  He was concerned about the digital divide and the substantial differences in broadband access  availability and affordability between developed and developing countries.  In that regard  it was important to close the digital divide  particularly on issues such as Internet affordability  and to ensure that the benefits of new technologies were available to everyone. He said the input from the working group on ‘enhanced cooperation’ in the United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD) was a critical contribution to the 10-year review of the implementation of the outcome of the World Summit on the Information Society in 2015.  Its recommendations  which would be submitted to the Economic and Social Council by June 2015  should address the need to promote and protect all fundamental human rights  including that of privacy.  Concerned about the negative impact of State surveillance and/or interception of communications on the exercise or enjoyment of human rights  he stressed that measures to combat terrorism must always be conducted in strict observance of international law.  Actions taken outside the international legal framework were unjustifiable  illegal  and unacceptable. AMERICO BEVIGLIA ZAMPETTI (Italy)  speaking on behalf of the European Union  said the Union attached importance to an open  inclusive and transparent  multi-stakeholder process for the WSIS+10 Review.  Ensuring active and meaningful participation  inputs and engagement by all stakeholders in the preparatory process and at the high-level General Assembly meeting were concerns for the Union.  The forthcoming review must take full account of the CSTD review under way.  Other key inputs included the outcomes of the event “Towards Knowledge Societies  for peace and sustainable development”  hosted by UNESCO in 2013  the outcomes of the WSIS+10 Review facilitated by International Telecommunication Union in June 2014  as well as the road map created at the Netmundial Conference in April 2014.  The Union also supported the renewal of the Internet Governance Forum mandate and called for ensuring stable and predictable funding for the Forum’s Secretariat. ABDUL GHAFAR ISMAIL (Brunei Darussalam)  speaking on behalf of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said ASEAN remained concerned with the widening gap across the ICT landscape.  According to recent statistics by the International Telecommunication Union  only 32 per cent of the population in developing countries would have Internet access by December 2014  compared to 78 per cent in developed countries.  In that regard  more progress needed to be made to bridge the digital divide among countries. He said that overcoming that divide was a huge challenge for ASEAN  given the various levels of economic development of its member States.  However  it was making progress on the implementation of the ASEAN Information and Communications Technology Master Plan 2015 to increase adoption of such technologies in rural areas.  It would also promote equal opportunity for its people to participate in regional development through the rollout of national broadband networks  improvements of national universal service obligations and collaboration with relevant sectors such as education. GUILHERME DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  as well as CELAC  said that ICT could help developing countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty  and achieve economic growth and development goals.  Therefore  it was essential to continue working towards improved access to such technology  and to bridge the digital divide.  He welcomed the report of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals and its recognition of ICT as drivers of sustainable development.  As cyberspace expanded  human rights  especially the right to privacy  required stronger safeguards.  Serious violations of human rights and civil liberties continued to take place.  As the Security Council had repeatedly declared  States must ensure that in their fight against terrorism they complied with the law and respected human rights. RONIT BEN-DOR (Israel) said that ICT had become the cornerstone of modern society.  Although ICT offered limitless opportunities  four billion people still lacked access to the Internet.  Addressing that “knowledge deficit” would be critical to achieving a sustainable world where no one was left behind.  Changes took place in the ICT landscape that made it more relevant towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the sustainable development goals.  The use of mobile communication helped illuminate changes in human well-being and facilitated innovative ways to respond to crisis.  In a multilateral framework  Israel would host the Forum for Well-being in Digital Media to encourage the development of a people-centred information society.  She added that the global challenges with the malicious use of ICT required joint efforts by the international community.  The World Summit on the Information Society would be critical in facilitating global cooperation and promoting ICT in developing countries. ANTON Y. MOROZO (Russian Federation)  sharing most of the report’s conclusions  welcomed the holding of a general review of WSIS+10.  The outcome should account for several inputs.  Noting the Russian Federation’s experience in overcoming the digital divide between regions  he said he was ready to share them.  The importance of the Internet would only increase once the post-2015 agenda was adopted  so it was important to ensure sensible Internet governance.  Though the world operated on a single web  some individual countries used their status and position to achieve military and political goals  attacking others and thereby encouraging other States to close themselves off.  If the worldwide web divided  international cooperation would weaken.  Terrorists were already using the web for illegal activities and a response was needed.  National policies included a doctrine on information security and an agency dedicated to combating attacks.  Along with other BRICS [Brazil  Russia  India  China and South Africa] countries  he condemned the collection of data over the web as a direct violation of State sovereignty and human rights  particularly privacy. TERRI ROBL (United States) underlined the need to recognize and promote the contribution of ICT to shared sustainable development goals.  An open  inclusive  multi-stakeholder approach would maximize the vibrancy and potential of ICT  helping Governments improve quality of life.  Access provision required involvement by Governments  the private sector  civil society and others to ensure cost reduction.  Investment was needed in networks and technologies  and efforts should promote innovation  growth and universal values of freedom of speech and expression.  That would not be achieved by erecting new barriers  fragmenting the global Internet or restricting the free flow of information.  She supported the 10-year review of the World Summit on the Information Society believing it crucial to ensuring and enhancing the contribution of Summit outcomes to development for years to come but stressing that review was not a chance to renegotiate the Summit’s outcomes. PALITHA KOHONA (Sri Lanka)  associating himself with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77  said that technology should be central to the post-2015 development agenda as the sector helped create jobs in developed and developing countries.  Yet there was a continuing digital divide between those two groups and disadvantaged people could benefit by appropriate applications of technology.  The Government was developing Sri Lanka as a regional technology hub and providing training in those skills for Government officials  teachers and school children.  Sri Lanka aimed to increase information technology literacy to 75 per cent by 2016  up from 50 per cent in 2014.  Employment in the sector had increased to 75 100 in 2013  up from 33 700 in 2007  while generating revenue of $720 million last year.  The Government’s goal was to generate $5 billion in revenue from the sector by 2022 and employ 200 000 people.  Sri Lanka had established more than 750 tele-centres and its e-Library  “Nenasala Programme”  had received the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations’ 2014 Access to Learning Award as the best rural technology access programme. KHANIM IBRAHIMOVA (Azerbaijan) said the impact of ICT on societies was not just a technical matter but a development issue  and called for a rapid development of that sector.  Many Eurasian countries faced interconnectivity challenges due to their landlocked status and inadequate infrastructure.  She mentioned a resolution on establishing the Eurasian Connectivity Alliance  initiated by her country and adopted by the General Assembly  as a vivid example of cross-border cooperation.  She concluded by saying that ICT enabled the achievement of all three pillars of sustainable development. KHALED BENAMADI (Algeria)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that ICT was a driver for sustainable development  and had a positive impact on countries’ growth and citizen participation in private and public life.  Solutions to socioeconomic issues also included a technological aspect  he said  urging States to address technology and science matters to ensure progress in achieving development goals.  An inclusive information society should be built in a broader context of the post-2015 development agenda  and an environment conducive to the North-South and South-South transfer of technology should be set out.  Moreover  management of ICT  especially the Internet  raised important issues related to international security.  In that context  he called for the enhancement of national  regional and international capacity for addressing cyber-security issues. DENIS ZDOROV (Belarus) said the United Nations should keep focusing on the development of ICT.  His country had been working on strategies to develop information technology by 2015  from improving infrastructure of broadband access to information security measures.  It had become a major supplier of ICT services  both nationally and regionally.  One of the main challenges in that area was to overcome the digital divide between developed and developing countries.  It was also important to establish international cooperation to prevent the negative effects of the Internet on children and youth.  Advisory and technological assistance must continue to be provided to Member States  including middle-income countries. ASOKE K MUKERJI (India)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said the ICT revolution presented a real and profound opportunity to fast-track development processes.  However  the statistics pointed to an ongoing digital divide  with the mobile penetration rate in developed countries four times higher than that of developing countries.  In terms of Internet usage  the penetration rate of 32 per cent in developing countries compared with almost 80 per cent in the developed world.  Almost 90 per cent of those without Internet access were in developing countries.  Moreover  women were 23 per cent less likely to use the Internet in low- to middle-income countries.  His country had long recognized the transformative potential of the “mouse”  and had recently launched an ambitious programme “Digital India”  the mantra of which was to “combine IT (Indian Talent) with IT (Information Technology) to create IT (India of Tomorrow)”. FREDERICK MUSIIWA MAKAMURE SHAVA (Zimbabwe)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  as well as the African Group  pointed out that the Rio+20 outcome document “explicitly underscored the catalytic role of ICT in achieving inclusive economic growth and development  sustainable development and poverty eradication”.  The digital divide was a major concern  particularly in terms of “availability  affordability  quality of access and broadband connectivity”.  More international cooperation was needed to close the gap and the United Nations could help.  States needed financial and technical support for infrastructure.  Proliferation of cell phones was often cited as a mark of progress  particularly in Africa  but progress should be defined in terms of positive outcomes like poverty reduction  inclusive and sustained growth  job creation and social cohesion.  As well as financial constraints  Zimbabwe’s landlocked nature also put limitations on development.  Although unlikely to switch to digital broadcasting by 2015  he welcomed any support to help do so. YASUAKI MOMITA (Japan) said that ICT would be an important enabler of the post-2015 development agenda  observing that the Working Group’s outcome document had repeatedly mentioned that fact.  The 10-year review of progress on the World Summit outcomes would come in 2015 and he was pleased that a resolution on the modalities of the review had concluded.  Preparation and implementation of the review was important and he welcomed the work of the CSTD and was looking forward to their final report.  The body’s findings should be fully accounted for when conducting the review.  The nature of ICT demanded a multi-stakeholder review  he reiterated  stating he looked forward to consultations during the preparatory process.  He encouraged delegations’ attendance at the high level meeting  pointing out that work done by Member States would contribute to bridging of the digital divide. YAOWALUK SUTHIMAUS (Thailand)  aligning with the Group of 77 and China  as well as ASEAN  stressed the role of ICT as a key driver and enabler of sustainable development.  Stressing the development role of ICT in two areas — food security and disaster risk management — she highlighted Thailand’s experiences and successes.  Collective global action was needed to bridge the digital divide between developing and developed countries  as well as between and within regions.  As the world moved from the Millennium Development Goals to the post-2015 development agenda  it needed to intensify efforts to strengthen ICT as a key means of implementation. MUSTAPHA EL ACHRAOUI (Morocco) said that ICT was omnipresent and vital to people’s lives.  It was especially crucial in rural areas  but technology remained costly for many and even those with access made only limited use of them.  Connectivity and optimal use had to be promoted  particularly given unequal access to technology.  He saw opportunity for technology to improve the health and education sectors  as well as e-commerce  noting the impact technology could have on freedoms and human rights.  Swift progress could come from the acquisition of technology  but there were many impediments  too  centring on resources and institutions.  There had been substantial progress in promoting ICT and its general use  he said  pointing to the “E-Morocco 2010 Strategy”  which had seen development of Internet and mobile telephony.  A national strategy for an information society called “Maroc Numerique 2013” had also been launched. FATEMA RASHEED MOHAMED ALI (Bahrain) said that ICT development fell under Millennium Development Goal 8 on global partnerships for development  which presupposed cooperation with the private sector on new technologies.  Major strides had been achieved in implementing the Goal including the use of technology for development.  A Higher Committee for information and communications technology focused on issues such as e-governance and implemented the e-Government strategy  aiming for improvements to efficiency.  Bahrain had been awarded two United Nations public service awards for its efforts in the field.  The National Telecoms Centre was ranked first in development of knowledge management in West Asia  and Bahrain was among the highest ranking in e-Government preparedness and e-services quality.  The e-Government authority was developing e-services to improve procedures and guarantee quality. XIE XIAOWU (China)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that while the rapid emergency and application of new technologies and concepts had brought tremendous economic and social benefits to mankind  the digital divide between developed and developing economies was ever-widening  seriously hampering development of certain countries and regions.  The international community should take stock of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on Information Society  give full play to the role of information and communications technology in the formulation and implementation of the post-2015 development agenda  increase technical assistance to developing countries and bridge the digital divide  so that the dividends derived from the advancement of such technology could be shared by all. FEH MOUSSA GONE (Côte d’Ivoire) endorsed the views of the Group of 77 and China  noting the decisive role that ICT played in formalizing development strategies nationally and locally.  Recognizing their importance to socioeconomic development  he described efforts to integrate technology into development strategies.  A strategy on national digital coverage had been launched  with increased use of computers in health  education  trade and agriculture.  The use of “e-government” was improving public administration and the quality of public services.  Laws had also been passed to strengthen governance and protection of users and consumers.  Telephony penetration was around 65 per cent  with the industry’s turnover up to $1.6 billion per year and investment over $2.24 billion.  The quality of mobile communications had improved  with costs also falling.  Despite progress  the digital divide remained large and developing countries needed support. JAVAD MOMENI (Iran)  associating with the Group of 77 and China  said that implementation of the World Summit on the Information Society outcomes  including provisions on Internet governance  was extremely important.  Voicing support for reviews of the Summit’s outcomes before the end of 2015  he said he saw merit in the proposal of the United Nations Group on the Information Society for the review to serve as input to the post-2015 development agenda.  He pointed to national policies aimed at closing Iran’s digital divide  such as programmes to improve ICT access.  Furthermore  the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology had worked to improve infrastructure to improve online provision of services in several areas  including education  commerce and health.  Iran’s information and communications technology budget for 2014/15 had grown by 95 per cent over the previous year. FRANCIS LORENZO (Dominican Republic)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  as well as CELAC  said his country’s commitment to modernization could be seen in its prioritization education and investment in information technology.  However  in many rural and remote areas of developing countries there was no network coverage and people lacked the means to purchase mobile phones.  His Government saw that as an opportunity to democratize access to cutting-edge technology through the provision of training and empowerment of vulnerable groups  including persons with disabilities.  In that context  his country was creating specialized digital screens in the Comprehensive Care Centres for Disability  to provide access to information technologies to children with different skills.  In addition  strategic alliances with economic and technology sectors were helping Dominicans gain the skills required in the labour market. ELIPHAS CHINYONGA (Zambia)  speaking on behalf of the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries  noted that more than 20 per cent of the nearly 450 million people in those nations lived below the poverty line of $1.25 per person a day.  They depended on trade and transport systems in neighbouring and coastal countries.  Their geographic liabilities and poor state of both physical and soft infrastructure generated high transaction and information costs  resulting in lower trade and financial integration.  But “landlockedness” should not be regarded as a fatality.  They could offset a significant portion of their disadvantage through improvement in infrastructure of their own and transit nations. More importantly  he said  landlocked developing countries should aim at structurally transforming their economies and promote industrialization and value-addition.  ICT was a critical enabler of economic development and investment  with consequential benefits for employment and social welfare.  On a national level  his Government’s waiving of customs duty on telecommunications equipment in recent years had resulted in the installation of mobile communication towers in about 169 rural chiefdoms.  The number was expected to almost double in 2015.  The mobile phone was now being used to transmit important medical information  such as pictures of cancer screenings. GARY FOWLIE of the International Telecommunications Union said it was essential to integrate technology into plans to achieve the sustainable development goals and post-2015 development framework.  The important role of technology was reflected only in four of the 17 proposed Goals  including gender equality  (Goal 5); infrastructure (Goal 9); education (Goal 4); and partnerships (Goal 17). Information communications technologies and broadband should be viewed as a cross-cutting  systems-oriented tool.  Yet 14 of the proposed goals made no direct reference to technology as an implementing aid.  Technology could be used to increase social inclusion by improving access to financial credit and services and e-governance.  To highlight the potential of technology  the Broadband Commission for Digital Development  created by the Union and UNESCO in 2010  recently published the report “Means of Transformation – Harnessing Broadband for the Post-2015 Development Agenda”.  The report analysed how the proposed sustainable development goals could benefit from the use of broadband  with the aim of helping policy makers create the right frameworks for its use. SHARON BRENNEN-HAYLOCK  Director  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Liaison Office to the United Nations  shared the outcomes of the thirtieth United Nations Round Table on Communication for Development.  It focused on mainstreaming communication for development in the United Nations system to support programmes and policies related to food and nutrition security  resilient livelihoods and family farming.  Participants agreed on the need for strong inter-Agency collaboration to address the issues through awareness-raising on the functions  mechanisms and possible benefits of ICT  collaboration on building national strategies and the use of strategies in policy advocacy.  The role of communication in the post-2015 agenda and sustainable development goals and emergencies  including the Ebola outbreak  was discussed and the Round Table reaffirmed its status as the only inter-agency mechanism enabling exchange among United Nations agencies.  It was agreed to establish a Technical Working Group to build United Nations coordination and leadership in the field. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-13,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaspd558.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. As the African continent moved towards greater integration  the Western Sahara “weighs heavily” on the Maghreb region  the Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) heard today as it concluded its general debate on decolonization  with calls for enhanced cooperation between the Special Committee and administering Powers. The representative of the United Republic of Tanzania asked: “If we are building the same house  why should we fight for the building materials?” Blaming the deadlock on lack of political will from “certain players”  the representative of Senegal emphasized the need to discourage efforts to disintegrate the social fabric of Western Sahara. The right to self-determination was the basis on which a democratic South Africa was founded  that State’s representative said.  To not recognize the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic would render his country an accessory to the denial of the people of Western Sahara to their right to self-determination. Rejecting Morocco’s attempts to associate the struggle for self-determination by the Saharan people with terrorist organizations  the representative of Namibia called for an immediate referendum there. The representative of Zimbabwe stressed that the 22-year-old ceasefire indicated the Saharan people’s quest for peace and determination to gain independence through a peaceful referendum. Attention also focused on the historic relationship between the Non-Self-Governing Territories and the administering Powers.  The representative of New Zealand said the obligation of the administering Powers was clearly outlined in the United Nations Charter.  He added that the relationship between his country and Tokelau was strong and built on mutual respect. Adoption of the same resolutions each year — with limited or no follow-up — was unacceptable  the representative of Belize said  supporting the appointment of a Special Rapporteur for Decolonization and revitalization initiatives as outlined in the Plan of Implementation of the Decolonization Mandate 2006-2007. Supporting Argentina’s sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)[*]  South Georgia  South Sandwich Islands and surrounding maritime areas  the representative of Nicaragua urged the United Kingdom to reciprocate Argentina’s commitment to resolve the dispute through dialogue. The representative of Viet Nam urged the United Nations to ensure that administering Powers promoted economic  cultural  and social development of the Territories’ peoples and to assist them in exercising their rights. Also speaking were representatives of Burundi  Honduras  Côte d’Ivoire  Guinea  Lesotho  Zambia  Bahrain  Gabon  Solomon Islands  Guyana  Jamaica  Belize  Cabo Verde  Bolivia and Mozambique. The Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. on Tuesday  14 October  to consider related draft resolutions and decisions. Background The Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) met today to continue its general debate on all decolonization agenda items.  For further background  see Press Release GA/SPD/557 of 10 October. Statements ALBERT SHINGIRO (Burundi) said the Western Sahara conflict continued to divide the international community; the Secretary-General should lead the way in urging all parties to compromise towards a win-win solution.  Human and political aspects of the crisis could be resolved if relations improved between the parties.  The regional dimension in the search for peace was crucial because the Western Sahara dispute was primarily a North African one.  The parties concerned must do more to promote human rights  he added  underscoring Morocco’s recent efforts in that regard.  He stated that Morocco’s plan provided the basis for a fair  acceptable and durable peace.  On the challenges of terrorism  drug trafficking  trafficking in human beings and transnational crime in the region  he stressed that firm international cooperation was required  addressing education and development in addition to security. KARLA GARCÍA LÓPEZ (Honduras) said it was essential that the United Nations stayed involved in the self-determination process.  For that purpose  a permanent dialogue was needed between the General Assembly  the administering Powers  and the people from the non-self-governing territories.  Regarding the Malvinas  which she called currently under occupation  she acknowledged good work towards a peaceful solution and reiterated the support of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) to Argentina.  On the question of Western Sahara  she stressed the need to find a fair solution to the conflict that respected human rights.  All parties should cooperate in that effort. VU VAN MIEN (Viet Nam)  associating himself with the statement made on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  expressed support for the aspirations of people under colonial rule to exercise their right to self-determination.  The Committee  he said  should enhance its efficiency in order to improve cooperation with administering Powers  and to ensure the participation of the peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories in the process to determine their own future.  He urged the United Nations to ensure that those Powers promoted economic  cultural  and social development of the Territories’ peoples and to assist them in exercising their rights. FODÉ SECK (Senegal) said that  since the declaration of the First International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism  not much progress had been made in the matter.  Lack of political will from certain players was responsible.  Supporting the Committee’s work  he added that  at a time when the African continent was heading towards integration  the Western Sahara dossier weighed heavily on the Maghreb region.  The threat of wider instability made a settlement even more urgent.  Disintegration of the social fabric must be discouraged  he stressed  reiterating his government’s support for Morocco’s plan for peace  which he called reasonable and fair. RAMADHAN MWINYI (United Republic of Tanzania) reaffirmed his country’s support for the aspirations of peoples under colonial rule to exercise their right to self-determination  in accordance with the relevant resolutions and provisions of the United Nations.  Completing the decolonization process would  he said  require a collective commitment  political will  cooperation and partnership  including enhanced cooperation between the Special Committee and administering Powers.  “We are building the same house” he added  asking  “Why should we fight for the building materials?”  On Western Sahara  he reiterated “unwavering support” to the cause of self-determination of the Saharan people.  It was incomprehensible that this question  which arose around the same time as the conflict in East Timor nearly 40 years ago  remained unresolved. PHILLIP TAULA (New Zealand) affirmed New Zealand’s commitment to cooperate with the Special Committee on Decolonization.  He said that  in compliance with the United Nations Charter  the relationship between New Zealand and Tokelau was based on listening to the concerns of Tokelau and helping it achieve its aspirations.  In following the self-determination process in 2006 and 2007  however  Tokelauans decided that the timing and conditions for self-determination were not right.  Tokelau faced the developmental challenges of geographical isolation and a small population.  A five-year plan for improving essential services had been put in place  focusing on transport  education  and natural resources such as fisheries; also  significant progress had been made in developing  renewable energy for a sustainable economy.  He added that the relationship between New Zealand and Tokelau was strong and built on mutual respect. FRANÇOIS XAVIER ZABAVY (Côte d’Ivoire)  associating his remarks with the statement made on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  said full implementation of the decolonization agenda was urgent  considering that two million people still lived under the scourge of non-self-determination.  In Western Sahara  the parties should strive for a just and acceptable solution in keeping with the hopes and aspirations of the people.  Although tension had been reduced in the region  particularly with the improvement in the situation in Mali  the world must remain vigilant.  Strengthening of brotherly relations among all States of Africa was crucial to ensuring the welfare of the region. SEKOU CAMARA (Guinea) welcomed all efforts to find a negotiated solution for Western Sahara.  Affirming that self-determination was an inalienable right and a natural historic norm  he supported the initiative proposed by Morocco as constituting a just foundation for a peaceful solution.  He said that the Moroccan approach was inclusive and showed that Morocco took responsibility for all areas of the territory  including the south.  For the successful implementation of that approach — which  he maintained could lead to progress and peace — he urged all parties to avoid the path of mistrust. KELEBONE MAOPE (Lesotho)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  said colonization had the potential to “wipe out” the colonized people’s identity.  In that context  he voiced regret that Western Sahara remained the only colony in Africa.  General Assembly resolution 40/50  of 2 December 1985  outlined the need for conditions that would allow for the peaceful and fair holding of a referendum for the self-determination of the Saharan people. Those conditions still did not exist.  Calling the lack of a human rights mandate for the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) “a great injustice”  he expressed Lesotho’s continued solidarity with the Territory’s people and advocated for direct negotiations between the parties. JEREMIAH NYAMANE KINGSLEY MAMABOLO (South Africa)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that neither the United Nations nor any regional or international organization – nor any other country in the world – had recognized Morocco’s claims of sovereignty over Western Sahara.  The Moroccan territorial claims had been rejected by the advisory opinions of both the International Court of Justice on 16 October 1975 and the Legal Department of the United Nations on 29 January 2002.  The International Court of Justice had stated that there had been no links of territorial sovereignty between Morocco and the Western Sahara prior to the Spanish colonization of the Territory.  In 1979  the General Assembly described Morocco’s presence in Western Sahara as “a continuing occupation”.  He thus called for an end to the illegal exploitation of mineral resources in the territory as well as an end to human rights abuses  which he said should be part of the peacekeeping mandate. MWABA PATRICIA KASESE-BOTA (Zambia) expressed concern that  54 years after the adoption of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) concerning the Declaration under which all remaining Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories were entitled to independence  17 such Territories remained around the world.  As a former colony  Zambia continued to support the principles of self-determination  as the legal and political basis of decolonization.  With that in mind  recent events in Gaza were of great concern  she said  urging renewed negotiations to create lasting peace in the region.  Zambia supported all efforts at finding a lasting  comprehensive  and peaceful settlement to the Palestine-Israeli conflict  and called for the establishment of an independent and viable Palestinian State.  On the other hand  she lauded the recent process by the Somalis to determine their destiny through the expansion of the national Government and rule of law.  That commendable development would contribute to the return of peace and stability to that region  she added. FREDERICK MUSIIWA MAKAMURE SHAVA (Zimbabwe)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that the General Assembly had consistently recognized the inalienable right of the Western Saharan people to self-determination.  The continuous occupation of that Territory was a violation of the United Nations Charter  and the authority and credibility of the Fourth Committee.  Given the Territory’s geographical location and membership in the African Union  he said the latter organization should complement efforts by the Secretary-General.  The ceasefire that had endured for 22 years was an indication that the Saharan people were indeed peace-loving  and determined to gain independence through a peaceful referendum. FAWAZ AL-ZAYANI (Bahrain) recalled the difficult time experienced by people labouring under colonialism and the bitterness of living in that situation.  The United Nations had backed the efforts of the Non-Self-Governing countries since the Organization’s creation in 1947  especially since the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and People.  That text reinvigorated interest in decolonization  and consequently resulted in the adoption of methods and means to achieve that objective.  Colonialism impeded the cooperation between  and the development of the Non-Self-Governing Territories.  The International community continued to seek ways to implement the Declaration  and he sought the adoption of an action plan for the end of colonialism.  Regarding Western Sahara  he backed efforts by the United Nations and Morocco.  The Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism 2011-2020 was an opportunity to discuss the international instruments to implement the decolonization with respect to the interest of all nations. MARIANNE ODETTE BIBALOU (Gabon)  associating with the Non-aligned Movement  congratulated the United Nations for its historic success in decolonization  particularly in Africa. However  she voiced concern at the millions still awaiting their right to self-determination. As the movement towards full decolonization continued  the international community should ensure ongoing social and economic development in the territories. On Western Sahara  she said a new impetus was needed to prevent destabilization of the wider region because threats  such as terrorism and illicit trade in weapons and drugs  underscored the importance of Morocco’s plan as the basis for a just and acceptable settlement. COLLIN D. BECK (Solomon Islands) said that  in order to deliver on the Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism 2011-2020  all parties should cooperate  including the administering Powers.  At a subregional level  the Melanesian Spearhead Group  made up of Papua New Guinea  Fiji  Vanuatu  the Solomon Islands and the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS)  continued to follow the question of New Caledonia.  That Group welcomed the visit of the United Nations Special Committee to New Caledonia in March  and noted concerns relating to the Territory’s electoral process.  Those concerns  which had persisted over a number of years  had implications for the preparation of a credible referendum.  The Committee must be empowered to play a more definitive role in resolving such issues. WILFRIED I. EMVULA (Namibia) called it “unacceptable” that the people of Western Sahara continued to die under colonial subjugation by Morocco  which also exploited the region’s resources.  He advocated for monitoring human rights violations  rejecting Morocco’s attempts to associate the struggle for self-determination by the Saharan people  notably the Frente Polisario  with terrorist organizations.  The United Nations should exert political and diplomatic pressure on Morocco for the implementation of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions allowing the region’s people to exercise their right to self-determination.  A referendum should be held immediately and States should urge Morocco to cooperate with the Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy. BIBI SHELIZA ALLY (Guyana)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and CELAC  stressed the need for friendly relations among Member States  particularly with their neighbours  and respect for the self-determination principle for all people.  In 1960  the General Assembly had declared that an inalienable right with its adoption of the decolonization Declaration.  Regrettably  that task remained unfinished.  French Polynesia was re-added  last year  to the list of Non-Self-Governing territories  she said  stressing that  at the midpoint of the Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism  efforts must be made to help the 17 territories reach independence; several of them were in the CARICOM region.  Regarding Turks and Caicos  she expressed concern that the overall state of political affairs was less than desirable  and supported the full restoration of democracy.  Western Sahara needed significant attention; she expressed her support for self-determination and a long lasting solution  encouraging the parties to work towards a solution within the framework of the United Nations  which must  she added  face its responsibility for a swift end to colonization. SHORNA-KAY MARIE RICHARDS (Jamaica)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and CELAC  said that  as a beneficiary of decolonization  the country fully supported the process.  Since much remained to be done  however  there was no room for complacency.  The administering Powers must initiate internal reforms and adopt measures to facilitate the decolonization of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories  taking into account their specific situations.  Jamaica called for a revisit of the Plan of Implementation of the Decolonization Mandate 2006-2007  including the appointment of a Special Rapporteur to analyse the current dependency arrangements.  Stating that a referendum was critical to determine the will of the Saharan people  she voiced concern about the situation in the Turks and Caicos Islands as well. LOIS MICHELE YOUNG (Belize)  associating herself with CELAC  pressed the United Nations to accelerate efforts to raise awareness about self-determination. She called for a more proactive approach to the working methods of decolonization mechanisms  saying that remedies to redress historical violations of self-determination could not simply be a reversion to the status quo. Indeed  adoption of the same resolutions each year – with limited or no follow-up – was unacceptable. Belize supported the appointment of a Special Rapporteur for Decolonization and revitalization initiatives as outlined in the Plan of Implementation of the Decolonization Mandate 2006-2007. The Saharan people must exercise their right to self-determination. FERNANDO JORGE WAHNON FERREIRA (Cabo Verde) supported the United Nations efforts for negotiations and a peaceful resolution in the Western Sahara dispute.  His delegation recalled the Security Council’s resolution on the fundamental parameters to resolve the conflict  for which political will and the stakeholders’ commitment were needed.  The Saharan region had been a source of concern owing to the threat of terrorism to neighbouring countries.  The Council reiterated had reiterated that the long-standing dispute required dialogue in the Maghreb. JAIME HERMIDA CASTILLO (Nicaragua)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and CELAC  said millions of people still suffered from traces of colonialism  which emphasized the urgency of sustained commitment to the process.  The recent decolonization seminar held in Fiji was positive  and those conferences must be continued.  Thanking the petitioners from Non-Self-Governing Territories for bringing their concerns and aspirations  he expressed support for Argentina’s sovereignty claims to the Malvinas/Falklands  South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and surrounding maritime areas.  The United Kingdom should reciprocate the willingness demonstrated by Argentina to resolve the issue through dialogue.  The militarization of the South Atlantic region by the United Kingdom was a constant source of concern to people there.  On Puerto Rico and Western Sahara  he urged the United Nations to work harder to ensure respect for the self-determination right. LUIS MAURICIO ARANCIBIA FERNÁNDEZ (Bolivia)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  CARICOM and Union of South American Nations (UNASUR)  believed that the development of Non-Self-Governing Territories was essential  and urged an end to the “archaic” practices of colonialism.  The United Nations expressed its desire to end colonialism around the world in all its forms; therefore  the administering Powers should take activities commensurate with that goal.  Reaffirming his support for Puerto Rico’s efforts towards independence  he said it was vital for the United Nations to shoulder its responsibilities and allow the people of Puerto Rico to have access to independence.  Since 1965  the United Nations stated that the United Kingdom and Argentina should resolve their dispute on the Malvinas Islands.  Since then  40 resolutions have been adopted  but the United Kingdom had not implemented them.  That country was draining the region’s resources  and with that  he asked it to refrain from such activities.  The region’s militarization  including with naval vehicles  should also be discussed.  The United Kingdom should return to the negotiating table where Argentina was already seating.  The international community acknowledged the need for bilateral talks.  ANTÓNIO GUMENDE (Mozambique) said self-determination was an inalienable right of the people  and should not be questioned by any country or foreign Power.  At a time when the world was quickly moving towards human progress and sustainable development  it was a great embarrassment that 17 countries were still Non-Self-Governing.  Calling for a free  fair  and independent United Nations-supervised referendum in Western Sahara  he urged the international community to work together towards a lasting solution that could contribute to peace  stability  and sustainable development in the region and beyond. * A dispute exists between the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (Malvinas).   Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-13,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gashc4101.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Conscious of women’s potential as agents for development  heads of United Nations agencies called for removing barriers to their full participation in all facets of life  the Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) heard today  beginning its discussion on the advancement of women with an interactive debate. “The scourge of gender violence  inequality and discrimination continues to hamper women’s full potential to contribute to and benefit from sustainable development”  said Sam Kahamba Kutesa  President of the General Assembly.  As the international community prepared to formulate and adopt the post-2015 development agenda  the pledge was to leave no one behind  he continued  calling for an effective  coordinated and inclusive approach to development for all. With a view to working in tandem towards gender equality  the work of the Third Committee  he said  gave “a voice to those who are marginalized  those who are vulnerable  suffer humanitarian crises  exclusion  discrimination  and violations of their fundamental rights”. Echoing that sentiment  Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka  Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of the United Nations Entity on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women)  said grave challenges remained.  Human trafficking  female genital mutilation  the denial of reproductive rights and forced and early marriages were the most dehumanizing forms of discrimination  she said. Despite progress made since the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals  much needed to be done  she added  since “no single country achieved the goal of women’s empowerment”.  Gender parity had not even been achieved within the United Nations system  she continued  as women held only 41.8 per cent of top positions.  Women’s involvement was indeed central to advancing other goals  including achieving peace and security  she stressed. Indeed  women must be involved in conflict prevention  resolution and peace-building  since they were among the first victims and targets in armed conflicts  said Nicole Ameline  Chair of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.  “Women’s rights are an essential component of peace ” she said.  While women could also be the main drivers of development  their continued under-representation in political and public life and exclusion from decision-making processes was reducing their ability to advance along that road  she said. Also impeding them along the path to full participation in development were physical barriers  said Kate Gilmore  Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).  To overcome those impediments  she urged the international community to “end preventable maternal and new-born mortality and morbidity  including fistula”.  While obstetric fistula was almost entirely preventable and treatable  she added  more than 2 million women and girls were living with the condition.  Also hampering women’s participation in development were poverty  gender inequality  a failure to uphold women’s and girls’ human rights and limited access to health services  she said. In the ensuing general debate  many delegates echoed similar concerns about the persistence of different forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls around the world  especially in relation to female genital mutilation  violence in conflict and reproductive rights.  Israel’s speaker said sexual and reproductive rights were not just a dry technical phrase  but “the difference between life and death”. Some speakers raised the issue of female genital mutilation.  Malawi’s representative  speaking on behalf of the African Group  noted with regret that the Secretary-General’s report on intensifying global efforts to eliminate that practice had failed to focus on its root causes  prevalence and contributing factors. Calling for a coordinated and holistic approach to end inequalities  some speakers outlined their proactive efforts on a range of issues.  A representative of Guyana  on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  described a regional plan aimed at ensuring that all adolescents had access to age appropriate  accurate information on sexual and reproductive health.  The end goal was to reduce the number of adolescent pregnancies in each country of the English- and Dutch-speaking Caribbean by at least 20 per cent between 2014 and 2019. Many delegates agreed that gender-based violence during tensions or conflicts needed to be addressed early and on the ground.  Italy’s speaker said that conflict prevention  training for armed forces and security sector reform were necessary to include a gender perspective and prevent violence against women in conflict situations. Also delivering statements were representatives of Bolivia (on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China)  Costa Rica (on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States)  Mozambique (on behalf of the Southern African Development Community)  Cambodia (on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations)  United States  Russian Federation  Cuba  Australia  India  Japan  Switzerland  Mexico  Myanmar  Morocco  Brazil  Netherlands  Philippines  Syria  Liechtenstein  Senegal  Lao People’s Democratic Republic  United Arab Emirates  Iceland  Nicaragua  Colombia  Suriname  Malaysia  Kuwait and Algeria  as well as the European Union Delegation. Participating in the interactive discussion were representatives of Switzerland  Iran  Cameroon  Bolivia  Costa Rica  Japan and Algeria  as well as the State of Palestine and the European Union Delegation. The Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Tuesday  14 October  to continue its discussion of women’s advancement. Background The Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) met this morning to begin its consideration of its agenda item on the advancement of women.  Before it were reports by the Secretary-General on the intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women (document A/69/222); intensifying global efforts for the elimination of female genital mutilations (document A/69/211); supporting efforts to end obstetric fistula (document A/69/256); measures taken and progress achieved in follow-up to the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly (document A/69/182); improvement in the status of women in the United Nations system (document A/69/346); and on trafficking in women and girls (document A/69/224).  Also before the Committee was the Report of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on its fifty-fifth  fifty-sixth and fifty-seventh sessions (document A/69/38). Opening Statement SAM KAHAMBA KUTESA (Uganda)  President of the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly  said the work of the Third Committee “gives a voice to those who are marginalized  those who are vulnerable  suffer humanitarian crises  exclusion  discrimination  and violations of their fundamental rights”.  As the international community prepared to formulate and adopt the post-2015 development agenda  the pledge was to leave no one behind  he continued  calling for an effective  coordinated and inclusive approach to development for all.  Turning to the Millennium Development Goals  he noted the progress made  but called for the acceleration of efforts to achieve unmet targets. Looking forward  he said the post-2015 development agenda needed to be transformative and to promote democratic governance  the rule of law  gender equality and human rights for all.  The upcoming year would see the launch of the International Decade for People of African Descent  the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child  as well as a high-level thematic debate on advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women.  Noting the progress made by the international community on those issues  he said “the scourge of gender violence  inequality and discrimination continues to hamper women’s full potential to contribute to and benefit from sustainable development.” Interactive Debate PHUMZILE MLAMBO-NGCUKA  Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of the United Nations Entity on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women)  said for all the progress made on the Millennium Development Goals  “no single country achieved the goal of women’s empowerment”.  She urged that those and related issues became specific goals on the post-2015 development agenda  as well as being recognized as cross-cutting factors regarding all other targets. Women’s involvement was indeed central to advancing other goals  she said.  On the fifteenth anniversary of the Security Council’s adoption of the resolution on women  peace and security  she called on Member States to contribute to an ongoing global study reviewing integration efforts.  Identifying women as the “best engine for development”  she noted that empowered women were critical to an effective response to climate change. More broadly  the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action was a chance to review progress made and challenges remaining  she said  applauding the 154 Member States that had reported their achievements  and urging others to submit their reports on the principle of information sharing.  Based on work of the Third Committee  she continued  the General Assembly had indicated that gender equality was a common responsibility.  Much work remained to be done  she said  describing a grim reality.  Human trafficking  female genital mutilation  the denial of reproductive rights and forced and early marriages were the most dehumanizing forms of discrimination.  Further  data showed that 50 per cent of murdered women had been killed by their partners or families. Introducing reports on a range of related topics (see Background)  she said despite progress in data collection and legislation  impunity for perpetrators of gender-based crimes was among the outstanding challenges.  So was progress at the United Nations itself  she continued  noting that the Organization had “not come close to gender parity”  because women held only 41.8 per cent of top positions.  She cited the Secretary-General  whose opening statement at the General Assembly’s current session had focused on change  when he said “Transformation is our goal.  I can think of no better place to start than with opening doors and shattering ceilings for women and girls.”  In closing  she said there was no better place to start than the United Nations. KATE GILMORE  Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)  said considerable progress had been made in focusing attention on maternal deaths and disabilities  such as obstetric fistula.  “The international community must act urgently to end preventable maternal and new-born mortality and morbidity  including fistula ” she declared.  While obstetric fistula was almost entirely preventable and treatable  more than 2 million women and girls were living with the condition  she said  adding that progress had been made in integrating fistula into national health plans and policies. Poverty  gender inequality and a failure to uphold women’s and girls’ human rights limited access to health services and led to fatal gaps across the continuum of care throughout the life-cycle  she said.  Underlining that the international community was moving towards finalizing the post-2015 development framework  she called on all relevant stakeholders to sustain their commitment to improving and maintaining maternal/new-born health  strengthening health systems  eroding health inequities and bolstering funding levels. Starting off the interactive discussions  representatives of Switzerland  Iran  Cameroon and Bolivia asked about the integration of the Beijing Platform of Action into the post-2015 development framework  measures to combat growing violence against women and the establishment of targets to enhance women’s participation. Answering a question on the inclusion of women in the post-2015 development agenda  Ms. MLAMBO-NGCUKA underlined UN-Women’s engagement  saying a comprehensive report had already been issued on the need to establish and mainstream women’s empowerment and gender equality.  On violence against women  consultations with Member States and United Nations agencies were raising awareness  ensuring that the issue would be at the centre of the post-2015 development agenda.  She added that in that regard  the integration of men and boys would be critical. Continuing  she said increasing the capacity to protect all citizens  especially women and girls  was essential  and that all partners must be committed to the rule of law  peace and development.  Asked by a representative of Costa Rica about teenage pregnancy  she recognized its negative effects on the lives of women and girls  and called for a comprehensive sexual education  underlining that women and girls must be aware of their rights to make better decisions. Ms. GILMORE  echoing those concerns  said it was essential for young women to have a comprehensive sexual education and full access to health services.  Giving girls access to education was of key importance  yet financial investment was also essential to broaden success.  Regarding a joint report on the issue by UNFPA and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  she highlighted elements  including that Member States had voiced their support for deepening and broadening initiatives.  However  priorities must be adjusted urgently  she stressed  reiterating the need for focusing on increasing numbers of adolescents. NICOLE AMELINE  Chair of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women  said that with 188 States parties  the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was “the only nearly universally ratified human rights instrument which provides for comprehensive protection of women’s rights”.  At the same time  the Convention was an instrument for women’s empowerment and equal participation and an international pillar for sustainable development.  Recognizing that women could be main drivers of development and noting their continued under-representation in political and public life  and exclusion from decision-making processes  she welcomed the opportunity offered by the post-2015 development agenda to make women’s substantive equality with men a reality. On the issue of women in conflict  she said “women’s rights are an essential component of peace  calling on the international community to reaffirm the place of women’s rights in a peaceful and equitable global manner.  Since women were among the first victims and targets in armed conflicts  she stressed the importance of their involvement in conflict prevention  resolution and peacebuilding.  A concerted and integrated approach must place the Security Council agenda on women  peace and security into the broader framework of Convention’s implementation  she said. Women also had critical roles to play with regard to climate change  she said.  Turning to the legal field  she emphasized the importance of parliaments in repealing discriminatory laws  adopting temporary special measures to accelerate substantive equality between women and men and in ensuring that national laws  policies and budgets reflected the rights and principles enshrined in the Convention.  In closing  she welcomed the increased presence of Parliamentarians in official delegations. During the ensuing interactive segment  representatives of Switzerland  Japan  Algeria  the State of Palestine and the European Union delegation asked a number of questions  including the position of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on reproductive rights in conflict situations  the role of women in political and societal transitions  access to justice and on activities targeting parliamentary involvement in the ratification of the Convention. Ms. AMELINE urged States to be vigilant on the issue of rape  adding that particular cases should ultimately allow for abortion.  On the issue of stereotypes  she noted the universal aspect of women’s human rights and called for the recognition of the human being as a whole.  The Convention was compatible with all religions  she added  as its aim was the elimination of violence and discrimination. The Convention  when applied  could be used as a conflict prevention measure  one that not only aimed at protecting the human rights of women  but was also a weapon aimed at increasing their presence in decision-making processes. With regard to the Convention’s universal ratification  she asked that countries lifted their reservations.  She also emphasized the importance for parliaments to recognize their responsibility  and said close contacts had been made with countries to strengthen their capacity to implement the Convention. Statements VALERIA VILASECA (Bolivia)  speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  said that the international community faced a myriad of challenges that needed to be addressed in order to achieve the full and effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.  Obstacles included high incidences of poverty and gender-based violence  high levels of HIV and AIDS  as well as widespread unemployment and the lack of access to services  such as social protection  health and education.  The “Group of 77” also called for intensified efforts at all levels in addressing alarming statistics concerning the increased incidents of trafficking in women and girls and violence against them. In addition to those persistent obstacles  she added  new threats were emerging  and it was vital to identify and address the negative impact of the global financial crisis  food crisis and climate change challenges on women and girls.  The Group also underscored the importance of gender-responsive budgeting initiatives to address gender gaps in policies and budgets.  Stressing the importance of sharing national experiences with gender equality programmes  she concluded that the role of UN-Women was crucial in promoting better coordination within the United Nations system to address multiple barriers that impeded women. CHARLES MSOSA (Malawi)  speaking on behalf of the African Group  noted with regret that the Secretary-General’s report on intensifying global efforts to eliminate female genital mutilation did not focus on the root causes and contributing factors to the practice and its prevalence  as requested by General Assembly resolution A/RES/67/146.  For its part  Africa had continued to establish ground-breaking initiatives and commitments to further gender equality  including the declaration of 2010 to 2020 as the African Women’s Decade.  As rural women constituted one fourth of the world’s population and the majority of Africa’s women  he said there was an urgent need to focus on their empowerment. Broaching on a range of issues  he said women and girls who lived in war-torn economies were excluded from participating in post-conflict reconstruction and peacebuilding processes.  It was also vital to address the challenges of infant and maternal mortality and the stigma encountered by women with HIV.  As frontline health workers and caregivers in their families and communities  women faced a greater risk from the Ebola outbreak.  Concluding  he said that the post-2015 development agenda  the Beijing Declaration and the African Union’s long-term development strategy were powerful vehicles in moving forward on meeting the needs of African women  particularly the poorest among them. ADRIANA MURILLO RUÍN (Costa Rica)  speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  said that the post-2015 development agenda  including sustainable development goals  must build on lessons learned so far.  Those including directly tackling unequal gender relations and gender stereotypes that discriminated against women and girls.  They must also address the broader context for the realization of gender equality  such as the impact of economic crises  violence  persistent conflict  climate change and environmental degradation  and they must be relevant to the contexts of small island developing States  as well as of middle-income countries. Eradicating the growing burden of poverty on women was essential  she said.  The centrality of gender equity in the development debate implied considering both the productive and reproductive dimensions and transforming the division of labour. Of particular concern was the situation of migrant  rural and indigenous women  women with disabilities  older women and women of African descent.  CELAC was also committed to intensifying measures to prevent and combat trafficking of persons  and the exploitation of migrants in all forms.  As a region composed primarily of middle-income countries  CELAC still faced challenges resulting from poverty and inequality  but also from cultural and social factors.  The Community  therefore  had advocated for more international dialogue  North-South  South-South and triangular cooperation  to support national initiatives in developing countries. GEORGE WILFRED TALBOT (Guyana)  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  said that the violence inflicted daily on women and girls was one of the most pervasive violations of human rights  manifesting itself in many forms across ethnicity and class.  Citing a 2014 World Bank Report  he said  “In most of the world  no place is less safe for a woman than her own home”.  CARICOM States had been unceasing in efforts to improve the status of women.  The women of the region had themselves been key advocates and actors in this effort  and had contributed to change through family law reform and minimum wage legislation.  The region was also seeking to address further challenges  such as persistent poverty and sexual violence. In August  the Community’s Council for Human and Social Development had approved a plan to reduce the number of adolescent pregnancies in each country of the English- and Dutch-speaking Caribbean by at least 20 per cent between 2014 and 2019.  The plan aimed at ensuring that all adolescents had access to age appropriate  accurate information on sexual and reproductive health.  As the Community plotted a path towards economic growth and sustainable development  a people-centred approach had been articulated to promote the welfare of its citizens.  Women had important contributions to make as providers of skills  knowledge and capital across the region  and the Community was committed to ensuring their equal participation in all aspects of the CARICOM Single Market and Economy. ANTÓNIO GUMENDE (Mozambique)  speaking on behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  said its Protocol on Gender and Development encompassed commitments made in all regional  continental and global gender-equality instruments  with 28 measurable targets to be reached by 2015.  Aiming at providing for the empowerment of women and eliminating discrimination  the protocol called for the harmonization and implementation of national  regional  and international instruments on gender equality and equity.  Despite commendable achievements  constraints still hindered full gender equality  with gaps between commitment and implementation. Contradictions between customary laws  national laws and international commitments  alongside a high incidence of poverty among women persisted  he said  adding that concerted efforts were needed to address those challenges.  Further  he said there was a need for joint efforts by all stakeholders  including women’s groups  political parties  government ministries  traditional leaders and parliamentarians.  Concluding  he reiterated the commitment of the Community’s members to strengthen collaboration and cooperation with the international community and development partners to achieve gender equality and the advancement of women  and to eliminate all forms of violence against women. RY TUY (Cambodia)  speaking on behalf of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  noted its members’ commitment to women’s empowerment and gender equality  exemplified by specific committees  programmes and work plans.  In addition  the ASEAN Women Entrepreneurs’ Network had been established in 2012  with an aim to provide a platform to mentor one another and share best practices on ways to do business and how to expand it. Mainstreaming gender perspectives across sectors and pillars  eliminating violence and discrimination  and promoting and protecting the rights of women were assured by a specific commission  he added.  In ensuring that the post-2015 development agenda was inclusive and gender responsive  he asked that issues across pillars  such as female migrant workers  women as victims and agents of change in response to climate change and in disaster risk reduction  were addressed in a holistic manner. EVA CHARLOTTA SCHLYTER  of the European Union Delegation  said women’s economic empowerment and their full participation in economic life were crucial for development and for improving the life quality.  Gender equality was smart economics  which could enhance economic efficiency  improve other development outcomes and make institutions more representative. UN-Women was playing a key role in empowering women and eliminating violence against them through its programmes  technical assistance  advocacy and normative work  she said.  In that regard  the European Union and UN-Women had intensified cooperation aimed at fostering policy dialogue and collaboration in several fields  including combatting sexual and gender-based violence  in line with the European Union Plan of Action on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in Development for the 2010-2015 period.  Turning to ending sexual violence in conflict  she said protecting women and ending impunity remained priorities for the delegation  which was supporting an integrated approach to preventing and punishing acts of sexual violence  and to ensure justice services and reparations for its victims. SEBASTIANO CARDI (Italy) said that his country had long supported a number of efforts  including the fight to end female genital mutilation.  Working in partnerships  Italy and the African Group had cooperated to address obstetric fistula  and  with the European Union and other partners  Italy would continue to fight to eliminate every form of violence against women.  In terms of armed conflict  he said conflict prevention  training of armed forces and security sector reform were necessary to include a gender perspective and prevent violence against women in conflict situations.  In conclusion  he said in 2014  in the context of Italy’s presidency of the Council of the European Union  his country would host a major international conference in Rome on gender equality in Europe. TERRI ROBL (United States) said that female genital mutilation and cutting were prohibited in her country  and hundreds of American organizations had been involved in efforts to fight the practice.  The report on fistula recognized the linkages between that condition  early marriages and reproductive rights.  Further  her delegation was pleased that the Committee would consider two resolutions on trafficking in persons.  The United States federal departments and agencies had worked together to coordinate the country’s efforts in preventing and raising awareness about trafficking.  Turning to elimination of violence against women  she added that recent United States legislation had strengthened penalties against those who committed violence against women  particularly indigenous women and girls.  “Beijing had set out a roadmap but implementation had fallen short of its lofty aims ” she said  calling on the international community to strengthen efforts to eradicate gender inequality. NIKOLAI RAKOFSKY (Russian Federation) said the Commission on the Status of Women must remain the primary coordinating body in countering discrimination against women.  For its part  Russia had participated actively in the work of the Commission.  The Secretary General’s report recognized that the exclusion of a gender perspective in each Millennium Goal acted as an obstacle in achieving the agreed targets.  That oversight must be corrected in the new post-2015 global agenda  he said. However  he cautioned  it was important not to go to another extreme by mechanically inserting gender indicators into the new targets.  There was no “one-size-fits-all” solution  and the defining element for the new agenda should be the quality  not the quantity  of gender indicators. RODOLFO REYES RODRÍGUEZ (Cuba)  aligning his delegation with the statement delivered on behalf of CELAC  stated that the feminization of poverty had continued to be a barrier to gender equality.  The economic trade and blockade imposed unilaterally by the United States on Cuba constituted the main impediment for the progress of Cuban women and girls.  Nevertheless  Cuba had achieved many of the Millennium Goals  including universal health care for all citizens  reductions in maternal mortality and freedom for reproductive choices.  The recent 2013 elections had brought the largest number of women to the Cuban Government  exceeding the goals of the Beijing platform.  Cuban women also received the same wages as men and had access to credit services and social security  he concluded. SHARMAN STONE (Australia) said that protecting women from violence  promoting women’s empowerment and supporting women’s leadership were priority areas for her country  domestically and internationally.  Australia was deeply committed to raising awareness about sexual violence and helping to ensure that crimes of sexual violence were prosecuted.  Turning to gender inequality  she said it undermined economic growth  human development and poverty reduction.  Further  she said  inequality came with unequal returns.  Limits on women’s participation in the workforce cost an estimated $89 billion every year in the Asia-Pacific region. MAYANK JOSHI (India) said that his country was fully committed to the vision of empowered women living with dignity and contributing as equal partners in development.  India had achieved considerable progress  including with nearly 1.5 million elected women representatives  and legislation that had been enacted to ensure a safe and secure environment for women both at home and in the workplace  to protect women and girls from sexual offences.  Looking ahead  he said that the eradication of poverty and the promotion of the empowerment of women and gender mainstreaming must be key economic development imperatives of the post-2015 agenda. ARINO YAGUCHI (Japan) said her country aimed at building a society in which women shined.  To remove barriers  Japan had promoted several areas towards the empowerment of women  among them facilitating their active participation in society  enhancing efforts related to women’s health  supporting their participation and protecting their rights in the field of peace and security.  The 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action continued to serve as fundamental principles for the empowerment of women and the protection of their rights  she said  calling upon the international community to set gender equality as a central issue within the forthcoming post-2015 development agenda. PAUL SEGER (Switzerland) said  regarding the widespread nature of rape  that legal frameworks guaranteeing gender equality were necessary as were monitoring mechanisms to ensure that offenders were held accountable.  Another unacceptable form of violence was female genital mutilation  a practice often closely linked to early marriage and early pregnancy  he said  calling on all Member States to end child marriage by establishing a legal foundation against the practice  and strengthening education for girls.  Turning to the report on trafficking in women  he expressed concern that a large majority of Member States had used the term “children”  thus failing to distinguish between boys and girls  even though girls were more affected than boys.  Switzerland firmly believed that the international community must tackle the root causes of gender inequality  including gender stereotypes and uneven power sharing.  A specific gender-equality objective must be included in the post-2015 agenda  he stressed. NELLY SHILOH (Israel) said that sexual and reproductive health was not just a technical phrase  but often was “the difference between life and death”.  Further  women performed two thirds of the world’s work and produced half of the food  yet they earned only 10 per cent of the income and owned 1 per cent of the property.  Her country believed in investing in girls and women  with gender equality enshrined in the 1948 Declaration of Independence.  Israeli women stood out as leaders in politics  law and the private sector  and the country was also working to advance gender equality beyond its borders through programmes such as Innovation: Africa.  In the Ugandan village of Kolonyi  the programme was working with the local community to build a water pump and irrigation system.  As a result  the women of Kolonyi were no longer spending their days collecting water.  Instead  they were growing their own crops and earning an income  she said. ELISA DIAZ GRAS (Mexico) said that her country supported the UN-Women’s Unite against Violence campaign  as well as various national campaigns against gender stereotypes.  The low number of complaints submitted by women victims of violence continued to be a problem  she said  noting that Mexico had emphasized the importance of drawing up gender statistics from cases brought to the police and  charges made by victims  because that was the best way to draw up public policies.  Her county’s national institute of statistics was taking a lead role in that matter  she said.  Mexico was also making efforts to mainstream a gender perspective into its national development plan.  More broadly  the post-2015 development agenda must include a transformative goal on gender equality  irrespective of the inclusion of a gender perspective in other goals  she concluded. EI MON SWAI (Myanmar) said promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women had been integrated into the Millennium Development Goals  alongside which UN-Women had played an important role in guiding the United Nations system to accelerate progress in achieving their targets.  For its part  the Government of Myanmar  she said  was deeply committed to intensifying efforts to promote gender equality and empowerment of women and girls through international cooperation.  Being a State party to the Convention  her country had taken concrete steps for the elimination of discrimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls.  In conclusion  she underlined that Myanmar was striving to reduce the poverty rate down to 16 per cent through increasing budget allocations in the social sector to benefit women and children. ABIDINE ABDEL KADER (Morocco) said gender inequality was a universal problem  which involved prejudice and discrimination against women and girls.  His country had achieved an increase in the presence of women both in the management of public affairs and in decision-making positions.  Further  he said  Morocco’s constitution contained provisions on equality  fighting all forms of discrimination.  Concluding  he said his country ensured that Moroccan women and girls were protected against violence and  with that in view  had created mechanism to fight against violence. ANTONIO DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil) said poverty eradication was the greatest challenge facing the world.  As of 2012  a man was three times as likely as a woman to get a job  leading to a gender gap in employment and a feminization of poverty.  Brazil’s women had greatly benefited from social policies  such as cash transfers and housing credit  and the country was also focusing on comprehensive sexuality education programmes and efforts to halt the march of HIV and AIDs among women.  Despite progress  there was growing consensus globally that without the full participation of women  development would be unsustainable.  Therefore  Brazil supported a stand-alone goal of gender equality in the post-2015 agenda that would frame the work of the United Nations for decades to come.  “We cannot afford to leave half of humanity behind ” he said. MARGRIET VANDER LINDEN (Netherlands) said in the course of work  her conversations with women had revealed a variety of vulnerabilities  from a female chief executive officer  who told her she was abused by a family friend as a child  to a student  who had been assaulted by someone at a party.  “What stood out in each case was how vulnerable women are ” she said  “Vulnerable when they are struggling to come to terms with the violence  vulnerable because of what had been done to their bodies  and vulnerable because of being made to feel guilty.”  Security Council resolution 1325  on women  peace and security  acknowledged the vulnerability of women in armed conflict.  But that text had not even been considered regarding an international armed response to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS).  In countless refugee camps on the borders of Turkey and Syria  women had narrated accounts of despicable violence.  The women and children who had fallen into the hands of ISIL had a right to justice  as did the Indian girl on the bus on the way to school and the lesbians in Africa who were subjected to so-called “corrective rape.”  More needed to be done to educate boys  because sexual violence was as much a men’s and boys’ problem  she said.  In closing  she said securing the rights of women and girls was a constant battle  and the international community must be vigilant in preventing and punishing violence against women. IRENE SUSAN BARREIRO NATIVIDAD (Philippines) noted a narrowed gender gap in education  peace and political participation since the adoption of the Beijing Platform of Action in 1995.  Despite progress made  new challenges had emerged  including new forms of violence in electronic media and those related to the impact of climate change.  She then announced the presentation of a biannual resolution on trafficking in women and children  aimed at strengthening the gender aspect of trafficking and highlighting the impact of humanitarian and natural disasters on trafficking in women and girls. BASHAR JA’AFARI (Syrian Arab Republic) said that it had been three years since Syrian women had been severely suffering from the worst forms of extremist and terrorist activities  including rape.  Wahhabi jihadist groups had imposed their “sick ideology and restrictions” on women in education  family and social life.  Citing the example of Saudi Arabia  he said  women and girls living there were allowed to drive or ride on bicycles.  He also emphasized that Syrian women and girls had been subjected to rape  murder  forced marriage and human trafficking in refugee camps in Turkey and Jordan.  He asked Member States hosting Syrian refugees to protect them from human trafficking and to help them live dignified lives. RENÉ HOLBACH (Liechtenstein) noted that “not a single country in the world has actually achieved full gender equality”.  One of the reasons behind that failure was the lack of political will by the men in power  he said  welcoming UN-Women’s HeForShe campaign that focused on the role of men and boys in striving for gender equality.  Turning to the post-2015 development agenda  he noted the lack of a specific goal related to ending violence against women  which was a global phenomenon affecting developed and developing nations.  “The systematic lack of accountability will always be conducive to new violence ” he concluded. FODÉ SECK (Senegal) said that a large majority of African women continued to face severe obstacles because social norms and stereotypes were slowing the progress to gender equality.  Female genital mutilation  early marriage and the violence women suffered in armed conflicts exacerbated the problem.  The use of rape as a weapon of war was a threat to human dignity  he said.  Reiterating the commitment of his country to combat fistula  he called on Member States to hold constructive negotiations on a draft resolution on that topic.  The international community could not hope to define the post-2015 agenda without a true awareness of the issue of empowerment of women.  Senegal had taken steps  he said.  Because women in Senegal confronted many challenges linked to access to financing  the Government had established a national credit fund to promote female entrepreneurship.  Further  the legal status of Senegalese women had improved considerably through new laws relating to violence against women  medical care  taxation and a law on political parity. THIPHASONE SENGSOURINHA (Lao People’s Democratic Republic) said the empowerment of women and gender equality were priorities  as exemplified by laws and gender mainstreaming into the country’s development programmes  plans and projects.  On the promotion and protection of women’s rights  activities and programmes had focused on equal rights for women at work  enhancement of knowledge amongst women and their participation in politics  socio-cultural activities and the family.  In addition  25 per cent of the members of parliament were women  he concluded. AMEIRAH OBAID MOHAMED OBAID ALHEFEITI (United Arab Emirates)  hailing the work of the United Nations and its bodies in advancing gender equality  said that her country’s constitution guaranteed gender equality.  The Emirates was one of the first States to reduce gender gaps in education and health.  Further  the country had also lowered the rate of childbirth-related deaths.  Women in the Emirates participated at all levels of decision-making  ranging from the ministerial level to the judicial.  The Government was also developing legislation that ensured secure environments for women and children and prevented all types of organized crime  transnational crimes and trafficking in women and children. GRÉTA GUNNARSDÓTTIR (Iceland) said Member States must continue to fight for the full implementation of commitments made almost 20 years ago to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.  Fully supporting UN-Women in the campaign to celebrate Beijing+20  Iceland had partnered with Suriname to lead a group of countries to galvanize support to promote gender equality.  Men and boys must be engaged in the fight for the benefit of all  she said.  Concluding  she said Iceland was committed to treat gender equality not only as a women’s issue  but also as a human rights issue that required everyone’s participation. MARÍA RUBIALES DE CHAMORRO (Nicaragua) said gender equality and the empowerment of women were key factors for achieving social and economic development.  Nicaragua had established a policy based on gender equality as a means of deepening inclusive democracy and building a just and developed society.  Underlining the initiatives taken in the recent years  she said the country’s constitution had envisaged the creation of a fund enabling women to have the same rights as men in purchasing land and that benefited rural women  in particular.  Her country was among the countries with the highest representation of women in decision-making processes  she concluded. MUSTAPHA KAMAL ROSDI (Malaysia) said that his country had achieved tremendous economic growth in the last few decades because of the greater participation of women in the development process.  Malaysia’s commitment to the economic empowerment of women was evident in its policies and programmes that intended to attract and retain female employees in workforce.  Further  his country was encouraging female entrepreneurship through specialized skills training workshops.  So far  4 300 women entrepreneurs had benefited from those workshops and were now venturing into various sectors  including agriculture and business.  Malaysia was encouraged by the work of the United Nations agencies in combating violence.  Malaysia continued to safeguard women’s rights through amendments to the penal code that widened the definitions of rape and domestic abuse  and addressed sexual harassment in workplaces. MIGUEL CAMILO RUIZ (Colombia)  lauding Malala Yousafzai for winning the Nobel Peace Prize  said that the discrimination and subordination of women was a pervasive problem for the international community.  His country was pleased to support a stand-alone goal concerning gender equality among the sustainable development goals.  As indicated by the Secretary-General  he said violence against women was based on structural inequalities and  therefore  laws were indispensable for protecting women.  An interdisciplinary approach was required to combat violence against women  he emphasized. HENRY LEONARD MAC-DONALD (Suriname) said that his country had a history of close collaboration between the Government and civil society in advancing women’s empowerment.  The national gender policy and a draft policy on domestic violence had been formulated in collaboration with civil society.  The involvement of men and boys was also crucial for changing negative stereotypes about women and achieving lasting behavioural transformations  he said.  The Millennium Goals  he added  unfortunately  had not addressed the critical matter of ending violence against women.  Therefore  Suriname was pleased to note that the report on the proposed sustainable development goals made a specific reference to the elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls. SOLTAN ALARADAH (Kuwait) said his country had recognized the political rights of women and supported women and girls through various measures.  The position of women had improved both in public services and decision-making as the Government of Kuwait had empowered them in their political participation.  Kuwaiti women also thrived in the labour market  enjoying equal pay for equal work and benefits  such as maternity leave.  Further  the Government had offered comprehensive benefits and assistance to people with social challenges  such as widows and women with disabilities.  Concluding  he noted that his Government would continue to fight for the empowerment of women. SABRI BOUKADOUM (Algeria) said that awareness-raising on violence against women needed to be complemented by other efforts  such as community mobilization.  It was worrying to note that women and girls constituted 75 per cent of trafficking victims detected globally.  For its part  Algeria had worked hard to improve its national legal framework to protect women’s rights.  The family and nationality codes had been amended to ensure greater balance in family relationships.  The adoption of a national strategy on gender had led the country to achieve a 93 per cent primary school registration rate for girls.  The rate of employed women had also increased significantly in the public sector  he said.  In the judicial system  the representation of women had reached 40 per cent of the total number of judges in 2013.  The combined action of the Government and civil society had improved women’s participation in politics. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-13,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gal3479.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. As the Sixth Committee (Legal) took up the report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)  the Chair of that Commission’s forty-seventh session highlighted the finalization and approval of a draft Convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration. Hahn Choonghee (Republic of Korea) told Committee members that the draft Convention would be “a powerful instrument to enhance transparency in investor-State dispute settlement”.  The Transparency Convention  if adopted  would allow States to apply it to arbitrations arising under almost three thousand investment treaties concluded before 1 April of this year. Detailing progress made by the Commission’s six working groups on topics ranging from micro  small and medium-sized enterprises to electronic commerce and insolvency law  among others  he also underlined the Commission’s technical support to facilitate the adoption of its texts  which was of particular importance to developing countries and to those States who were less familiar with the Commission’s work. In addition  he emphasized the importance of the Commission’s system of case law on UNCITRAL texts (CLOUT)  pointing out that CLOUT included over 1 400 abstracts of cases available to the general public in the six official United Nations languages on the Commission’s website. The Commission had developed effective working methods and a negotiating culture that was efficient and inclusive  he said.  The Convention on Transparency was just one example of UNCITRAL’s ability to shape the global policy agenda into legal norms that made international commercial law efficient while balancing concerns affecting public interest. However  many of the projects were funded through extra-budgetary means  he pointed out  urging all stakeholders to contribute to sustain them.  He also observed that UNCITRAL’s Secretariat was at the same staff levels as it had been in the 1970s  and he called on the Sixth and Fifth (Administrative and Budgetary) Committees to provide the necessary support. Responding to questions raised and comments made by delegations today  he had recalled that the Open Working Group on the post-2015 agenda had emphasized the importance of trade.  It was in that light he underscored how private commerce and trade formed “a locomotive for economic growth” that would make the post-2015 agenda feasible and possible.  The Commissions’ work should be part of the post-2015 discourse. Praising UNCITRAL and its work  speakers today lauded the finalization of the draft Convention and spoke of varying aspects of the Commission’s work important to their national concerns.  Austria’s representative  whose country would be coordinating UNCITRAL resolutions  called the adoption of the draft Convention one of UNCITRAL’s most important achievements. Zambia’s representative  also commending the finalization of the Convention on Transparency  welcomed the Commission’s work on micro-  small- and medium-sized enterprises aimed at developing economies.  Those sectors drove economic growth in most countries  including his  and their promotion was a viable approach to sustainable development. Israel’s representative expressed support for initiatives aimed at establishing practical online dispute resolution rules for low-value  high-volume cross-border transactions  while Canada’s representative noted the challenging nature of such work; the Commission had decided to include consumers within the scope of that work  making it important to ensure that the rules safeguarded consumer protection. Concluding consideration of the rule of law at the national and international levels were representatives of Saudi Arabia  Madagascar and Jordan  as well as observers from the Holy See and International Development Law Organization (IDLO). Also participating in deliberations on UNCITRAL were representatives of Costa Rica (speaking for CELAC)  Belarus  Singapore  Russian Federation  Japan  India  Algeria  South Africa  Republic of Korea  United States  United Kingdom  El Salvador  Madagascar and Philippines. The Sixth Committee will next meet at 10 a.m. on Tuesday  14 October  to take up the Report of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization and to consider Observer Status in the General Assembly for several groups. Background The Sixth Committee met today to conclude its debate on the rule of law at the national and international levels.  For background  see Press Release GA/L/3478. It then would take up consideration of the report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) on the Work of Its Forty-Seventh Session (document A/69/17). Statements on the Rule of Law GORMALLAH ALZAHWARI (Saudi Arabia)  underscoring that his Government was based on the tenets of Islam  and thus on justice and equality among individuals  said that while there was not an agreed upon definition of the rule of law  United Nations activities must not lead to a unilateral definition of the principle or classification of States in any way or form.  The principle of equal sovereignty required that States focus on their equal opportunity to participate in drafting law at the international level.  His country had worked for peace and justice  and had refused the use of force or violence and any practices that threatened global peace.  Condemning and rejecting international terrorism  he stressed that Islam was free from terrorist practices with which it was sometimes unjustly associated.  He added that the international community must not replace local authorities in the establishment of rule of law at the national level. LYDIA RANDRIANARIVONY (Madagascar)  associating herself with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that sustainable development based on inclusive growth was a major objective of her country’s State policy.  Her Government had focused on the re-establishment of the rule of law by restoring State authority in order to gain its citizens’ confidence and allow them to work in peace and had aimed to re-launch the economy.  In order to improve access to justice  the Ministry of Justice undertook actions in line with its Constitution which provided all people the right to obtain justice.  As a lack of resources should not be an obstacle in obtaining justice  a decree regulating legal aid or assistance was passed in 2009.  Legal aid offices were being progressively established  along with legal information offices.  Her Government had also established legal clinics to raise people’s awareness of their rights  gather complaints with respect to community-based cases  propose mediation and bring parties together to bring them access to law and legislation. ALI ABSOUL (Jordan)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  said his country had long supported international tribunals  recognizing their importance in the promotion of the rule of law at the international law.  Jordan had also ratified the Statute of the International Court of Justice.  At the national level  it had established new institutions  including the Ombudsman’s Office  which promoted integrity and the National Council for Human Rights towards facilitating its citizens’ access to justice.  An adjustment to the law on accountability enabled efforts to prevent corruption.  In 2007  the Government sought to increase the expertise of judges and promote relationships among partners in the litigation process.  The Ministry of Justice launched a development plan this year to enhance the judiciary based on a code of conduct  promote integrity and reform and develop a system of oversight by including an assessment of judges. BERNARDITO AUZA  Permanent Observer of the Holy See  endorsed a definition of the rule of law which was both rationally and morally grounded upon the substantial principle of justice.  The rule of law meant that  in relations among States  there be a paramount respect for human rights; equality of the rights of nations; and respect for customary law  treaties and other sources of international law.  In future debates on the matter  he would welcome increased attention to the human person and the society in which that person lived because the rule of law was unattainable without social trust  solidarity  civic responsibility  good governance and moral education.  At the international level  if rule of law was to reflect justice  frameworks on the international protection of persons must be fairly and impartially applied by States to guarantee equal recourse to the protections available within the United Nations Charter.  If States were unable to guarantee such protection  the international community must intervene with juridical means provided in the Charter and in other international instruments. PATRIZIO CIVILI  Permanent Observer  International Development Law Organization (IDLO)  said that the IDLO advocated a practical  results-based approach to the rule of law that would focus on how greater justice  both nationally and internationally  could contribute concretely to furthering sustainable development.  In addition  IDLO supported States in furthering access to justice  a main pillar of his Organization’s work.  Grassroots legal empowerment  alongside capacity building in the justice sector  constituted the core of its activities in that area  which pursued through promoting gender equality and upholding the rights of women and girls; expanding legal services for poor and marginalized communities; and using the law to advance the right to health.  His Organization’s current or recently completed projects had been geared towards supporting different needs in that area  from access to legal services and rights awareness raising to empowering girl victims or those at risk of trafficking  and the protection of land rights for women. Introduction of Report HAHN CHOONGHEE (Republic of Korea)  Chair  of the forty-seventh session of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)  said the highlight of the recent two-week session had been the finalization and approval of a draft Convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration.  The previous year  the Commission had adopted Rules of Transparency in Treaty-Based Investor-State Arbitration  which applied only to the settlement of disputes arising under investment treaties concluded after 1 April 2014.  The draft Convention before the Sixth Committee would allow the Rules to apply to arbitrations arising under almost three thousand investment treaties concluded before that date. Thus  he continued  the Convention would offer those States wishing to make the Rules applicable to their treaties “a powerful instrument to enhance transparency in investor-State dispute settlement” without the expectation that other States would necessarily have to use it. A signing ceremony was envisioned for March 2015 in Mauritius  with Sixth Committee approval. Noting that investor-State arbitrations were of public interest  particularly in countries receiving significant foreign investments  he urged those States to consider becoming party to the Convention.  To make information available to the public  the Rules provided for the establishment of a Transparency Repository.  The Commission had unanimously proposed that its Secretariat serve in that capacity.  A dedicated webpage on its website was already available as a pilot project  and the Secretariat had been requested to seek necessary funding. Another important achievement was the Commission’s decision to publish the UNCITRAL secretariat Guide on the Convention on the Recognitions and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards  known as the New York Convention  he said.  It was freely accessible online  and contained the most comprehensive resources existing to date  including case law and bibliography references.  He went on to detail progress made by the Commission’s six working groups on topics ranging from micro-  small- and medium-sized enterprises  of particular relevance in developing countries  to electronic commerce and insolvency law among others.  In the field of online dispute resolution  a draft of procedural rules relating to low-value  cross-border disputes arising from electronic commerce transactions was being prepared  he continued.  Also under consideration were the effects of online dispute resolution on consumer protection in developing and developed countries  as well as countries in post-conflict situations.  In addition  a draft resolution to enable the use of electronic transferable records was being prepared. Touching on insolvency law  he said the Commission was addressing cross-border insolvency of multinational enterprise groups  of increasing importance in the post-economic crisis world.  Development of a model law or legislative provisions on the recognition and enforcement of insolvency-derived judgements was being considered.  In addition  progress had been achieved in preparing a draft model law on secured transactions. He also noted that the Commission was actively providing technical assistance to facilitate the adoption of its texts  of particular importance in developing countries and in countries less familiar with the Commission’s work.  Observing that the conduct of that work depended on financial contributions to the trust fund for such activities  he appealed to all States  international organizations and other stakeholders to contribute.  He further called on regional private and public stakeholders to contribute to the UNCITRAL Regional Centre for Asia and the Pacific  located in Incheon  Republic of Korea  the Commission’s only regional presence. Describing the system of case law on UNCITRAL texts (CLOUT) and the digests as the “third pillar of UNCITRAL’s work”  he noted that CLOUT included over 1 400 abstracts of cases  available to the general public in the six official languages on the Commission’s website.  He reiterated an appeal to Member States for additional resources to enhance CLOUT’s performance  pointing to the increasing number of States who looked to UNCITRAL texts when reforming or modernizing international trade law regimes. With the number of initiatives affecting international trade growing  the Commission’s coordination role was becoming increasingly important  he said.  To that end  it maintained a sustained involvement in the initiatives of other organizations in the field of international trade law  with the aim of sharing information and avoiding duplication of work.  UNCITRAL  as well  was focusing its efforts to promote the rule of law at the national and international levels on such dimensions as access to justice as normative protection  capacity to seek remedies and capacity to provide effective remedies. It was clear that a sound regulatory framework for businesses  investment and trade was a powerful driving force in addressing many sustainable development challenges  he said.  Equipping the United Nations with the knowledge and tools to assist States in building capacity to put in place sound commercial law frameworks was essential.  To that end  he encouraged greater integration of the Commission’s work in relevant United Nations programmes. The Commission had developed effective working methods and a negotiating culture that was efficient and inclusive  he underscored.  The Convention on Transparency was just one example of UNCITRAL’s ability to shape the global policy agenda into legal norms that made international commercial law efficient while balancing concerns affecting public interest.  Pointing out that the Commission’s Secretariat was essentially the same size as in the 1970s  he called on the Sixth and Fifth (Administrative and Budgetary) Committees to provide the necessary support. Statements on UNICTRAL GEORGINA GUILLÉN-GRILLO (Costa Rica)  speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  said the United Nations’ challenges in the codification of international trade law were increasing over time.  In light of the volume and characteristics of global trade and the ongoing technological development and diversification of business activities  the Commission’s work should correspond with the dynamics of trade activities as closely as possible.  For CELAC member States  participating in the sessions involved a significant effort.  Addressing paragraphs 292  293 and 294 of the Commission’s report on “the dates and venues of future meetings”  she said alternating venues for the meetings between New York and Vienna eased the participation of countries since there were those who did not have permanent diplomatic representation in Austria.  Noting the Organization’s budget limitations  she said that that facilitating logistics for the wide participation of members enriched the debates. ULRIKE KOHLER (Austria) said among UNCITRAL’s most important achievements was the adoption of the draft United Nations Convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration.  The text was intended to give those States that wished to make the Rules on Transparency applicable to their existing investment treaties an efficient mechanism to do so  without creating any expectation that other States would use the mechanism offered by the Convention.  UNCITRAL also played a key role in strengthening the rule of law in the field of international trade law.  At its forty-seventh session  it held a rule of law briefing and panel discussion.  She said her country would again serve as coordinator for UNCITRAL resolutions.  Two draft resolutions had been circulated last week: the annual Omnibus Resolution on the Report of UNCITRAL and a draft resolution on the United Nations Convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-state Arbitration. ILYA ADAMOV (Belarus) welcomed the draft convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration  as well as the guidelines on the New York Convention. However  the guidelines on insolvency law did not fully take into account the needs of micro  small and medium enterprises and should be adapted to the needs of developing countries  where such enterprises made significant contributions to the economy.  Stressing that regulatory mechanisms on those enterprises’ insolvency should be flexible and impactful  he supported the development of a model law on the matter.  As well  development of a compact model law on secure transactions would assist States in formulating national legislation.  In that context  his Government was reforming legislation on collateral and access to credit.  New topics for UNCITRAL’s consideration could include  among others  private-public partnerships  provided that it would not lead to further expenditures.  He underscored that UNCITRAL’S work could serve as a model to other bodies  as its work was not politicized. NATALIE MORRIS-SHARMA (Singapore) expressed support for UNCITRAL Secretariat’s repository function established under the Transparency Rules  stating that it would promote the availability of the decisions of arbitral tribunals.  That  in turn  would enable States and investors to better understand the rules which governed the investment landscape and make more informed decisions.  However  she pointed out that it was still unclear how pleadings and awards were to be redacted  and to what extent they would be redacted when parties were unable to agree and the Tribunal was not available to provide a ruling.  Other possible issues were liabilities that the repository could encounter and any costs it would incur.  Given UNCITRAL’s constraints  optimizing the use of its scarce resources  including its Secretariat and working groups  was imperative.  The Commission must exercise greater control over its working groups and must prioritize the subjects that each group was to address.  As well  the UNCITRAL Secretariat and Commission should carefully consider how the Commission’s work could be streamlined to ensure that there was no duplication and inconsistency in outcomes. ELENA MELIKBEKYAN (Russian Federation) welcomed the draft Convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration  which provided important mechanisms relating to international trade law and was invaluable for regulating commercial litigation.  However  she called for greater coherence of standards.  Noting the growing importance of ecommerce  she stated that in August of this year  the Russian Federation had become party to the United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts. KAITARO NONOMURA (Japan) commended the assumption of the new mandate which contained legal issues simplifying the establishment of micro-  small-  medium-sized enterprises  which was critical not only for economic development but also for new entrepreneurs.  Also  he congratulated UNCITRAL for having finalized and adopted the Transparency Convention.  His delegation would continue to participate in the work on the online dispute resolution rules for cross-border electronic commerce transactions.  Furthermore  his country had established basic legislation on electronic transferable records  which would help the discussion in that regard. KOTESWARA RAO (India)  expressing support for the work of the Commission  said that the legal texts and model laws prepared by the Commission had practical value for individuals  corporations and States.  He voiced support for holding the signing ceremony for the draft convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration in Mauritius and proposed naming the convention for the name of the city of signing as the Port Louis Convention on Transparency.  Supporting adoption of that draft convention  he noted however  that it would have been preferable for there to be an “opt in” provision  with respect to the Treaty’s applicability  rather than an “opt out” provision. MOHAMED SALAH EDDINE BELAID (Algeria) commended the finalization of the draft transparency convention and the efforts of Working Group II (Arbitration and Conciliation) in that regard.  He expressed support for the Commission’s Secretariat taking on the role of repository of published information under the Transparency Rules.  He expressed satisfaction with the upgrade of the UNCITRAL website and the establishment of the transparency registry page  and welcomed the initiative of Mauritius to host a ceremony for the signing of the transparency convention  once adopted by the General Assembly.  He also noted progress made by other working groups. NEELU SHANKER (Canada) noted with great satisfaction the Commission’s approval of the draft Convention and its recommended adoption by the General Assembly.  He also welcomed the establishment of the repository at UNCITRAL for the publication of information and documents in treaty-based investor-state arbitration.  His country supported the Commission’s decision to consider the feasibility and possible form of work in the area of enforcement of international settlement agreements resulting from conciliation proceedings.  UNCITRAL’s work on online dispute resolution had been challenging as the Commission had decided to include consumers within the scope of that work.  Thus it was important to ensure that the rules safeguarded consumer protection.  It was also important to examine alternatives to arbitration awards as means of effective implementation of online dispute resolution outcomes.  He also said he was pleased at the support expressed by most States for his country’s proposal regarding future work on legal issues related to cloud computing. THEMBILE JOYINI (South Africa) said the Mauritius Convention on Transparency  adopted in July of this year  established a mechanism through which all parties to existing investment treaties could efficiently and effectively update the procedural rules governing investor-State arbitrations under those treaties.  That would then assist in effectively implementing the Transparency Rules and better take into account the public interest nature of those disputes.  In November 2013  his Government had published the much anticipated draft Promotion and Protection of Investment Bill  which had been introduced as part of an overhaul of the regulatory framework for foreign investment in South Africa.  That had been done to address a legitimate and widely shared concern that bilateral investment treaties and the international system of investor-State arbitration inhibited the ability of Governments to enact legislation and regulatory measures aimed at promoting public policy objectives in areas such as public health  environmental protection and social equality. HOSHIN WON (Republic of Korea) welcomed the finalization and adoption of the draft Convention  a testament to the growing concerns on promoting transparency in investor-State arbitration.  The promotion of the rule of law in commercial relations should be an integral part of the United Nations’ broader agenda.  Furthermore  UNCITRAL’s regulatory framework for business  investment and trade was a powerful force in addressing many challenges to sustainable development.  In that regard  he expressed support for the Commission’s role in effectively integrating the rule of law in commercial relations within the United Nations system.  His Government had sponsored activities of the UNCITRAL Regional Centre for Asia and the Pacific  including a conference on micro-businesses and another on arbitration  which served as a critical venue for discussion by experts of international rules in the Asia-Pacific region. CAROL HAMILTON (United States) said the new Convention would be a convenient tool for applying transparency measures to arbitrations occurring under the thousands of existing investment treaties  without having to amend each treaty separately.  All States should consider becoming parties to the Convention.  She also voiced support for the Commission to continued its consideration of whether changes were needed to the processes by which it developed its work programme  including  among others  how to avoid the creation of permanent or semi-permanent working groups that continued to propose extensions of their own mandates  as well as whether UNCITRAL should reduce the number of its working groups to five  rather than six. JESSE CLARK (United Kingdom) said that the draft Convention was an important mechanism that enabled States to apply the rules on transparency to arbitrations under existing treaties and to promote transparency in the international investment protection system.  His delegation had participated in the forty-fourth and forty-fifth sessions of Working Group V to discuss possible topics for future work and to advance the current mandate of the group to develop principles for facilitating the cross-border insolvency of multinational enterprise groups.  It was then agreed that that topic would be continued together with the development of text on the obligations of directors of enterprise group companies in the period approaching insolvency  a topic which his delegation had proposed to the group and which the Commission had agreed to at its forty-sixth session. AMIT HEUMANN (Israel) commended UNCITRAL on the adoption of the “Mauritius Convention”.  He also expressed support for the efforts of Working Group III to establish practical online dispute resolution rules for low-value  high-volume cross-border transactions.  There was hope that dialogue achieved at the last Commission would lead to concrete progress in the drafting of rules that would address both the need to allow for binding awards to be issued and the concerns of certain States regarding the compatibility of such a mechanism with domestic applicable legislation.  Furthermore  UNCITRAL would benefit from a greater use of information technology  both for communications between governmental experts  where appropriate  and between the Commission and the broader public.  In particular  an increased use of social media could expand the Commission’s visibility  reach and influence. RUBÉN IGNACIO ZAMORA RIVAS (El Salvador)  welcoming the draft Convention  said it would contribute to a harmonized legal framework for international commerce and encourage best practices.  He also expressed satisfaction at the work conducted with regard to micro  small and medium enterprises.  Noting that his country had both benefitted from UNCITRAL’s work and had participated in it  he said that El Salvador had conducted the second seminar on trade law  facilitating the dissemination and application of UNCITRAL instruments  particular regarding cross-border insolvency.  Also voicing appreciation for UNCITRAL’s work on securities  he noted that his country was working to incorporate UNCITRAL rules into national legislation towards keeping with international norms. LYDIA RANDRIANARIVONY (Madagascar) said that international trade was one of most effective means of participation in the global economy  encouraging developing countries to reduce their dependence on aid.  To re-launch its economy  her country had revived the trust of its partners by guaranteeing security of investment through simplification of procedures and tax incentives.  It was also aiming to boost its agricultural and tourism sectors.  The Government had improved its legislation by adopting laws relating to commercial enterprise  transparency of businesses  competition in investment  combating corruption and money-laundering  among others.  Her country had also deposited ratification on the Convention on the International Sale of Merchandise recently  an important tool in international commerce.  A training seminar on economic diplomacy would be held in Madagascar between 15 and 18 October of this year in partnership with the International Commerce Centre in Geneva and the United Nations through United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). IGOR GARLIT BAILEN (Philippines) said his country looked forward to supporting the adoption of the Convention by the General Assembly and welcomed the Working Group II’s next work on revising the organizing arbitral proceedings’ notes  as well as the issue of enforcing international settlement agreements resulting from conciliation proceedings.  As micro-  small- medium-sized enterprises constituted the bulk of economic activity in many developing countries  the various legal obstacles they faced must be reduced in order to encourage them to trade at the international level.  His country supported Working Group I’s progressive contributions in that regard and its preliminary discussions on the development of a legal text on simplified incorporation and business registration.  He said that he followed with keen interest the contributions of other Working Groups and was especially interested in recommendations on how the draft rules on online dispute resolution could respond to the needs of developing countries and those in post-conflict situations. KASWAMU KATOTA (Zambia) commended the finalization of the Transparency Convention  and welcomed the Commission’s work on micro-  small- and medium-sized enterprises aimed at developing economies.  Such work was especially important because those sectors drove economic growth in most countries  including his.  Their promotion was a viable approach to sustainable development.  The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) had adopted draft policy on micro-  small- and medium-sized enterprises to increase their prevalence in the region.  The policy addressed  among others  infrastructure improvement and the promotion of technical production capacity  which included the creation of a micro-  small- and medium-sized enterprise fund at the regional and country level.  During the sixty-eighth session  the General Assembly had  in a resolution  appealed to Governments to make voluntary contributions to a trust fund to provide assistance to developing countries that were members of the Commission towards facilitating their participation in the Commission. Closing Remarks Mr. HAHN  acknowledging the Sixth Committee’s views  encouragement and shared commitment on the importance of the Commission’s work  said that UNCITRAL needed to expand its outreach activity because of how advanced technologies were increasing private commercial activities online and through ecommerce.  Therefore UNCITRAL’s work must be broadly publicized.  As to duplication of efforts by working groups  he said he would pay attention to the mandates and duration of working groups  ensuring that they complemented rather than duplicated each other’s work.  Finally  he stressed that the Commissions’ work should be efficiently and effectively positioned in the context of post-2015 discourse.  He would think about how it should best be promoted in rule of law issues and in the post-2015 development agenda.  Pointing out that the Open Working Group on the post-2015 agenda spoke of the importance of trade  he said that private commerce and trade formed a locomotive for economic growth and would make the post-2015 agenda feasible and possible. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-13,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gadis3501.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. There was “no good purpose for bad weapons”  heard the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) today as a cross-section of non-nuclear-armed States called for greater global disarmament efforts. In a thought-provoking discussion that challenged the international community to step up the pace of disarmament  the representative of Lebanon said that the world’s current struggles with violence  crime and terrorism made it clear that “the path of peace was better than the path of war”. This sentiment was echoed by other countries associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  including the Congo  whose representative reminded delegates that the world was filled with “hotbeds of tension and conflict” where terrorists and extremists were committing “acts of barbarous violence”.  The world could no longer dodge the threat of nuclear weapons once they fell into the hands of non-State actors  he warned. Continued reliance on nuclear weapons was possibly the “greatest driving force” behind their proliferation  said the representative of Austria  adding that whether or not there was concrete proliferation  the symbolism and status associated with nuclear weapons certainly proliferated. He said new information had come to light about the risks associated with nuclear weapons  which were more serious than previously known and which could never be eliminated completely.  Humankind had been very lucky so far at their non-use; however  reason demanded urgent action to eliminate those weapons. Indeed  the world was at a critical juncture  said the representative of Tunisia  pointing out that more than half of the world’s population lived in nuclear-weapon States or in those that were members of a nuclear alliance. Against a backdrop of globalization  she continued  the international arms trade was evolving and fuelling violence in conflict and post-conflict zones around the world.  Disarmament was  therefore  the best bulwark to prevent arms from falling into the hands of non-State actors or terrorist groups. Jamaica’s representative  whose delegation also chairs the Committee  said it was crucial to nurture an atmosphere of mutual confidence  non-discrimination  increased transparency and trust  while exercising the political will and commitment to achieve the First Committee’s goals. She said her country  having been disproportionately affected by the “irresponsible” trade in conventional weapons  welcomed the ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty as the world continued to grapple with the “sobering reality” that small arms and light weapons killed an estimated 300 000 people each year. Also speaking were the representatives of Kuwait  Hungary  Burkina Faso  United Arab Emirates  Kenya  Kyrgyzstan  Viet Nam  Oman  Estonia  Montenegro  Cabo Verde  Papa New Guinea  Sudan and Italy. The First Committee will meet again at 3 p.m. on 14 October  to continue its general debate. Background The First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) met this morning to continue its general debate.  For background  see Press Release GA/DIS/3497. Statements ABDULAZIZ ALAJMI (Kuwait)  associating with the Arab Group and Non-Aligned Movement  called for a new approach to particular objective frameworks that allowed implementation of disarmament-related agreements in a measurable way and avoidance of obstacles that hindered those efforts.  Member States should find ways and means to meet the increasing challenges  he said  commending the establishment of zones free from nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction as an important step.  However  the Middle East was still a long way from achieving that goal.  Israel must accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and submit its nuclear installations to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) control.  He also stressed the importance of Iran’s cooperation with the Agency  and supported efforts under way on that issue.  He said he saw some hope in that regard  while reiterating that self-defence was an important right  as well self-determination for nations under occupation.  He called for transparency and flexibility from Member States to achieve a world that was peaceful and secure. GYORGY MOLNAR (Hungary)  associating with the European Union  said that despite the current stalemate  his country continued to hold the Conference on Disarmament in high regard.  The first step towards its revival would be the adoption of a programme of work  and that  he stressed  should be the focus of future presidencies.  Hungary sought a truly “robust” programme that allowed for negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty.  Another essential building block missing from the legal nuclear disarmament architecture was the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).  In the months ahead  Hungary would intensify its efforts to reach out to States that had not yet signed or ratified it.  The elimination of nuclear weapons could not be a single act  but rather had to be a gradual  comprehensive process  which fully engaged the nuclear-armed States while preserving the integrity of the NPT. DER KOGDA (Burkina Faso)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and African Group  said that disarmament remained a key concern on the United Nations’ agenda.  The Arms Trade Treaty would be the first to establish binding global norms and would thus contribute enormously to tackling conflict  insecurity  instability and banditry and protect the victim populations.  His country had undertaken an outreach campaign for that Treaty’s adoption  which included workshops for members of parliament and other authorities.  Due to the looming threat of nuclear war  the world lived in the shadow of Armageddon.  For that reason  it was important to end policies of nuclear deterrence. LANI ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates)  associating with the League of Arab States and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that her country firmly believed that issues of disarmament and non-proliferation were significant in achieving the objectives of international peace and security.  She underlined the importance of involving women in international disarmament efforts and playing a central role in promoting global peace and security.  Additionally  her country supported the peaceful use of nuclear energy  as that was essential to meeting the world’s growing energy demands.  The country was proud to be a pioneer in the region and it upheld the highest standards of transparency  safety and security.  She emphasized the need to continue negotiations between Iran and the “P5+1” in order to reach a comprehensive settlement on the country’s nuclear issue within a specific time frame.  She was deeply concerned that no tangible progress had been made in establishing a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. ANTHONY ANDANJE (Kenya)  associating with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that none of today’s global challenges could be solved by any one nation  no matter how powerful.  Multilateralism was  therefore  imperative.  And yet military spending  instead of being cut  was increasing at an alarming rate.  The NPT required disarmament and not increased armament  but the modernization of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems  the pursuit of pre-emptive strike doctrines and threat of use of nuclear weapons did not create an atmosphere conducive to disarmament.  Despite the rhetoric on arms reduction  the reliance on nuclear weapons attested to the central role they continued to play in security policies.  That was “counterproductive”  he said  adding that every citizen had the right and duty to oppose the existence of nuclear weapons. EL KHANSA ARFAOUI HARBAOUI (Tunisia)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Arab and African Groups  said that the world was at a critical juncture in which more than half of the global population lived in countries that were either nuclear-weapon States or members of a nuclear alliance.  She regretted the lack of destruction of those weapons through a bilateral or multilateral treaty  and the absence presently of any substantive negotiations.  Fresh efforts were needed  she stressed  to eliminate nuclear weapons and divert those resources to economic and social development  building democracy and protecting the environment.  Disarmament was also the best bulwark to prevent arms from falling into the hands of terrorist groups or non-State actors.  With globalization  the global arms trade was evolving and acts of violence were being committed in conflict and post-conflict zones around the world.  The uncontrolled proliferation of small arms and lights weapons devastated civilians  particularly women and children  and more and more were falling into the hands of terrorist networks. NURAN NIYAZALIEV (Kyrgyzstan) said that preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was one of his country’s most important policies.  He welcomed the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons  and would continue to support efforts aimed at that important topic.  The CTBT was one of the key instruments in the field of nuclear disarmament  non-proliferation strategic stability and security.  It was vital to prevent non-State actors from gaining access to nuclear  chemical and biological weapons through implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004).  A zone free from nuclear weapons was established in Central Asia  signed in 2006 and entered into force in 2009  he said  urging the nuclear-weapon States to ratify the protocol to that treaty  which provided negative security assurances to States in that region. SHORNA-KAY RICHARDS (Jamaica)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  said that no matter what the challenge and perceived realities  the promotion of multilateral disarmament must play a central role in the goals of general and complete disarmament.  In the face of the urgent tasks before the international community  the question remained how to move multilateral disarmament forward after nearly two years.  Clearly  it was crucial to nurture an “atmosphere of mutual confidence  non-discrimination  increased transparency and trust  while exercising the political will and commitment to achieve the stated goals and objectives of the First Committee and the wider disarmament machinery. As a country that had been disproportionately affected by the “irresponsible” trade in conventional weapons  Jamaica welcomed the ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty and took pride in its active contribution to that process as one of the first countries to have signed and ratified it.  As the world continued to grapple with the “sobering reality” that small arms and light weapons killed an estimated 300 000 people worldwide each year  Jamaica viewed the inclusion of those weapons in the scope of the Arms Trade Treaty as an important complement to the 2001 United Nations Programme of Action. NGUYEN PHUONG NGA (Viet Nam)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  said the First Committee was beginning its work this year against the background of various novel challenges.  As the Secretary-General had put it  it had been a terrible year for the principles inscribed in the Charter  but disarmament was now viewed as a distant dream.  It was then important to respect fundamental principles of international law and the Charter  especially respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.  She called for greater accession to the CTBT  especially those whose ratifications were necessary for its entry into force.  Viet Nam was cooperating with partners to develop nuclear-energy infrastructure.  It also supported the Conventions on cluster munitions and anti-personnel mines  and was working with international partners to rid the country of explosive remnants of war. MAYA DAGHER (Lebanon)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Arab Group  said that in the struggle against violence  crime and terrorism  it was important to remember that the “path of peace was better than the path of war”.  Echoing the words of the Secretary-General  she said that there was “no good purpose for bad weapons”.  Efforts must be redoubled  therefore  to encourage dialogue and create a foundation in which human rights  rule of law and sustainable development were used to address the roots of violence.  Lebanon  as it aspired towards the complete elimination of nuclear weapons  called for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free-zone in the Middle East and highlighted that Israel was the only State in the region that had not acceded to the NPT.  As such  it called on the international community to put pressure on that country to submit all its nuclear weapons to IAEA safeguards.  Lebanon had suffered greatly from attacks on its aerial and maritime borders  as well as repeated aggressions on its infrastructure  which resulted in the loss of innocent lives. ALEXANDER KMENTT (Austria) said his country was proud to be among the first 50 to have ratified the Arms Trade Treaty; its universalization and effective implementation would be crucial to translate the obligations therein into concrete measures.  He commended the international community’s decisive cooperation to remove and destroy Syria’s declared chemical weapons stockpile as the right response to such grave breaches of international law and international humanitarian law.  Concerning Iran  Austria remained hopeful that negotiations with the “EU+3” would resume in Vienna this week  and could lead to a solution of the Iranian nuclear issue. He said his country had always been a staunch supporter of the NPT  but the focus on proliferation was not sufficient.  The crisis in Ukraine had led some to question the feasibility of nuclear disarmament.  Continued reliance on nuclear weapons was possibly the greatest driving force behind their proliferation.  Whether or not there was concrete proliferation  the symbolism and status associated with nuclear weapons certainly proliferated.  New information had become available about the risks associated with nuclear weapons  which were more serious than previously known and which could never be eliminated completely.  Humankind had been very lucky so far at their non-use  but reason demanded urgent action to eliminate those weapons. MOHAMED AHMED SALIM AL-SHANFARI (Oman)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Arab Group  said that  despite numerous international meetings and conferences over the past three decades  progress had not been made in nuclear disarmament talks or in the reduction of nuclear proliferation.  Moreover  delays in convening an international conference on the Middle East were evidence that some parties did not understand its importance and goal.  Now was the time to resolve this issue.  He meanwhile expressed Oman’s commitment to the United Nations Programme on the illicit trade in small and light weapons and confirmed that his country had submitted its instrument of accession to the Mine-Ban Convention.  In doing so  it contributed to an important convention that aimed to spare individuals from falling victim to mines left over from wars and conflicts. MARGUS KOLGA (Estonia)  associating with the European Union  said the arms Trade Treaty was an extremely important instrument  and he was pleased to see that more than half the United Nations Member States had signed it and more than 50 had ratified it.  That was a major accomplishment for the international community.  However  the CTBT had not entered into force 17 years after its opening for signature.  He fully supported all three pillars of the NPT  and would continue to promote the full implementation of the 2010 Action Plan.  The agenda of the Conference on Disarmament encompassed global concerns  which should be negotiated in a transparent  multilateral way by a wider group of States.  He welcomed Albania’s nomination as special rapporteur to review the issue of membership.  With the Conference the single multilateral negotiating forum for disarmament  there was no reason why an interested State should not be allowed to participate fully in its negotiations. MILORAD ŠĆEPANOVIĆ (Montenegro)  associating with the European Union  acknowledged the “considerable reductions” in nuclear arsenals by the United States and Russian Federation since the end of the cold war  but with 17 000 nuclear weapons still in existence  relatively limited progress had been achieved in the field.  Ongoing efforts to modernize and upgrade nuclear weapons did not align with the NPT  he said  stressing that the risk presented by their proliferation and their potential impact on international peace and security was a “constant concern that could never be fully eliminated”.  He urged a renewed focus on the full implementation of existing obligations and outcomes  adding that “real and substantive” progress in nuclear disarmament with the aim of total elimination was “long overdue”.  His country had helped to prepare the National Action Plan on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004)  with an aim to ensure full and effective compliance.  It also had submitted its national report on the resolution’s implementation  he added. FERNANDO WAHNON FERREIRA (Cabo Verde)  associating with the African Union and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that as part of multilateralism it was possible to create adequate mechanisms to make significant headway towards global disarmament.  He supported the legal provisions of international instruments in the field of security  and was committed to dialogues and platforms for international discussions for reducing weapons of mass destruction.  The intentional or accidental use of nuclear weapons would have a fatal impact on the planet  on life and humanity.  To that end  he called for the NPT’s universalization. PETER BONNY (Papua New Guinea)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that the successful outcome of debates on disarmament issues were dependent on the engagement of nuclear-weapon States and other major arms-producing States  as well as their full compliance with relevant protocols and treaties.  Much had been achieved on that front in the last several years  he said  highlighting the reduction of nuclear arms between the Russian Federation and United States  as well as the disposal of chemical weapons in Syria.  While he called for a peaceful and nuclear-free world  he said his country also supported the view that the development of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes was the “inalienable right of every country”.  Within that context  he called for more openness by all concerned countries to eliminate any doubts about their nuclear programmes. RAYMOND SERGE BALÉ (Congo) said that practically everywhere in the world hotbeds of tension and conflict were evident.  Terrorism and extremism were displaying objectives of territorial conquest  illustrated by acts of barbarous violence.  Those dangers had shaken the sense of stability for countries.  The world would no longer dodge the threat of nuclear weapons once they fell into the hands of such non-State actors.  He announced the deposit last month of the instrument of ratification of the CTBT  which was in keeping with his country’s commitment to promote peace and security at the regional level.  He welcomed international efforts to conclude an instrument to ban fissile material.  The total elimination of anti-personnel mines was another challenge  and he urged States to cooperate with the Mine-Ban Convention.  The global community must persevere in disarmament despite setbacks and today’s complicated international situations.  Member States must press ahead to usher in a peaceful  prosperous and stable world. RAHAMTALLA MOHAMED OSMAN ELNOR (Sudan)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement the African and Arab Groups  called for the international community’s support on the establishment of a Middle East nuclear-weapon-free zone  stressing that a conference was needed to create a binding timetable towards its achievement.  The only way to bolster international security in the region was to place nuclear weapons under IAEA scrutiny  including those of Israel  which had not yet acceded to the NPT.  Sudan had been among the first to ratify the Treaty  as well as the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty  or Treaty of Pelindaba.  Another disarmament priority for his country was small arms and light weapons  as it had  like many others  suffered greatly from them.  Sudan had sought to confront the issue  hosting a regional workshop on combating their proliferation and establishing border checkpoints at the borders to help prevent those weapons’ spread.  Sudan had come a long way in the implementation the United Nations Programme of Action and was establishing contact offices to implement policies at national and regional levels. VINICIO MATI (Italy)  associating with the European Union  said that multilateralism and international cooperation were crucial to effective  concrete and long-term results in disarmament.  One recent multilateral success was the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty.  It was more than just a treaty on the arms trade  but was a binding instrument that fostered respect for human rights.  By envisioning binding criteria for the prevention of gender-based violence  the Treaty had  for the first time  included a gender perspective and the concept of human security in the broader context of global security.  In closing  he said the deadlock in the Conference on Disarmament was no longer acceptable  and he expressed satisfaction with efforts to revitalize its work. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-13,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11569.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The administration of justice could not be measured in monetary terms alone  the General Assembly was told today as the Presidents of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals and the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and for the Former Yugoslavia presented their annual reports. Justice was priceless  said the representative of Guatemala  adding that the deterrent effect of tribunals should also be noted.  At a time when the two Tribunals were wrapping up their work  now was the right moment for the international community to reflect on the impact they had had  not just in advancing international criminal law  but in advancing the principles of the United Nations. The contribution of the Tribunals could not be overstated  said the representative of the United States  as they had made immeasurable contributions to the development of international law in ensuring accountability for genocide  from recognizing rape as a crime against humanity to compiling data on how to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity. Citing numerous international protocols recently signed  the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina pointed out that continued regional cooperation was a precondition for reconciliation in the region. Justice could not be served without the cooperation of the countries on whose territory the crimes were committed  agreed the representative of Serbia. His country had shown readiness to accept its nationals to serve their sentences  and could see no reason for the continued implementation of the 1993 recommendation of the Secretary-General providing for the enforcement of sentences outside the territory of the former Yugoslavia  he said. Rwanda’s representative  for her part  reiterated a request that the archives of the Rwanda Tribunal be hosted by her country. Making sure the records of the Tribunal were accessible and manageable after their transfer to the Residual Mechanism should ensure that the events in Rwanda would never be forgotten and might also serve as road maps for future tribunals  and to empower domestic courts and educate the world on the importance of challenging impunity  said Vagn Joensen  President of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Theodor Meron  the President of the Former Yugoslavia Tribunal and of the Mechanism  said that the expectation was for that Tribunal to complete its judicial work and close fully in 2017.  The Tribunal's achievements since its founding had exceeded the expectations of even the most optimistic observers.  That was a testament to the international community's dedication to the rule of law and its commitment to ending impunity. At the conclusion of the meeting  the Assembly took note of the reports introduced. Representatives of New Zealand (on behalf of Canada and Australia)  Norway (on behalf of the Nordic countries)  Nigeria and the Russian Federation also spoke  as did a representative of the European Union Delegation. The General Assembly will meet again at 10 a.m.  on Thursday  16 October  to elect five non-permanent members of the Security Council. Background Meeting this afternoon to consider the international criminal tribunals  the General Assembly had before it two notes of the Secretary-General transmitting the following:  the nineteenth annual report of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994 (document A/69/206)  as well as the twenty-first annual report of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (document A/69/225).  Also before the Assembly was the Secretary-General’s note transmitting the second annual report of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (document A/69/226). Introduction of Reports VAGN JOENSEN  President of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)  introduced the Tribunal’s nineteenth annual report (document A/69/206-S/2014/546).  Summarizing highlights of the reporting period of 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014  he said that  since the Tribunal's Trial Chambers had been completed in December 2012  the remaining work had now been focused on the Appeals Chamber on the judgements of five persons.  A further three judgements were issued in the Appeals Chambers on 29 September concerning four persons.  The Ngirabatware appeal was pending before the Mechanism  with expected completion before year’s end 2014. The Appeals Chamber had completed all of its work with the exception of Nyiramasuhuko et al.  which involved six persons  and which would be no small feat to complete in such a relatively short time  he said.  A request for extension of the terms of office had recently been made.  Significant progress had been made towards the transition to the Mechanism.  Member States should continue to encourage the Secretariat and other United Nations entities to strongly consider the application from the Tribunal for Rwanda staff members. The Tribunal had already completed transfer of the second and final transfer to Rwanda of an accused in custody  Bernard Munyagishari  in July 2013.  There were four cases pending  two in Rwanda and two in France.  Six fugitive’s cases had also been transferred  leaving only three fugitives to be tried by the Mechanism.   Monitoring the cases now would rest with the Mechanism.  Interim monitors from the Mechanism had continued to monitor the transferred cases. The Rwanda Tribunal continued to prepare the records for preservation by the Mechanism  to make sure they were easily manageable after transfer  to ensure that the events in Rwanda would never be forgotten and might also serve as road maps for future tribunals  and to empower domestic courts and educate the world on the importance of challenging impunity.  As of 1 October  the Mechanism had received about 47 per cent of the physical Rwanda Tribunal records. The Office of the Prosecutor had made significant progress  had continued litigation on 26 appeals in seven cases  handed over responsibility for the tracking of fugitives to the Mechanism and provided support to the Rwandan authorities for prosecuting crimes and the transfer of cases  he said.  In January  the Office of the Prosecutor released a best practices manual on the prosecution of sexual and gender-based violence. He remained deeply concerned that no solution had been identified for the relocation of the remaining eight acquitted persons and three convicted released persons in Arusha  and called on the Member States for their urgent assistance.  Only Belgium had recently accepted an acquitted person  Augustin Ndindiliyimana  who would now live in that country. The Tribunal had also led and participated in events that commemorated the over 800 000 men  women and children killed in April 1994  which he said helped facilitate the healing process.  It planned to hold a legacy symposium and other events in Arusha  followed by a ceremony on 8 November.  The Office of the Registrar continued to play a key role in providing outreach to the public.  A further sharing of practices between the Tribunals and the International Criminal Court  however  could not continue without further funding. THEODOR MERON  President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and of the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals  introduced the Tribunal’s twenty-first annual report (document A/69/225) and the Mechanism’s second annual report (document A/69/226).  He said that the Tribunal had made steady progress since last year in completing its last remaining cases.  At present  the expectation was that it would complete its judicial work and close fully in 2017.  The Tribunal's achievements since its founding had exceeded the expectations of even the most optimistic observers.  That was a testament to the international community's dedication to the rule of law and its commitment to ending impunity. Turning to the work of the Mechanism  he said that it continued to make progress at assuming relevant functions  including witness protection and maintenance of archives.  A permanent building was being constructed in Arusha to house the Mechanism's remaining administrative functions.  A range of judicial work had already been undertaken  and further  the Mechanism would cooperate with authorities in national jurisdictions. Two challenges faced the Mechanism  however  he said.  Apprehending the remaining nine individuals indicted by the Rwanda Tribunal was one.  A second challenge was relocating individuals who had been acquitted by the Rwanda Tribunal  or who had finished serving their sentences.  Though their number was small  it was vital to the credibility of international justice institutions that those individuals be appropriately relocated.  He urged delegates to discuss with their Governments accepting one or more of the acquitted or released individuals. The international community had a long history of trying to address the worst crimes that accompanied war  he said.  In founding the Rwanda and Former Yugoslavia Tribunals  the symbolic and material goal of justice had finally been reached  a goal that had eluded the international community for centuries.  The Rwanda Tribunal  the Former Yugoslavia Tribunal and the Mechanism  along with the International Criminal Court  were profound and lasting achievements.  With the continued support of the international community  those institutions would serve as harbingers of a world where impunity was history. Statements GILLES MARHIC  representative of the European Union Delegation  aligning with Macedonia  Montenegro  Serbia  Albania and Armenia  reaffirmed the Union's unwavering support for the Rwanda and Former Yugoslavia Tribunals  as well as for the Mechanism  and asked that they continue to get the support necessary to complete their mandates.  He praised the transition from the Tribunals to the Mechanism.  But  continued cooperation from Member States was crucial.  The failure to arrest nine fugitives who remained at large was a grave concern.  States should intensify their efforts and cooperation with the Arusha branch of the Mechanism for the fugitives’ arrest.  He pledged continued support from the European Union for the Office of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda Prosecutor  and said that it was an essential condition for the Stabilization and Association Process in the Western Balkans  and for the membership of Western Balkan States in the European Union.  Despite improved regional cooperation between the States of the former Yugoslavia  and the Office of the Prosecutor  the challenges in coordinating judicial activities in the region were a serious concern.  He urged all States to cooperate with both Tribunals and branches of the Mechanism. JIM MCLAY (New Zealand)  also speaking on behalf of Canada and Australia  said that the Tribunals in their 20 years of operation had added breadth and depth to international criminal law jurisprudence.  Acknowledging the efforts of the Tribunals  he noted that there were no fugitives at large from the Former Yugoslavia Tribunal  which had concluded proceedings against 141 of 161 indicted people.  However  critical work remained to be done  as trials of three of the most senior indicted figures were ongoing.  States had a central role in facilitating the Tribunals' important work.  The successful apprehension of the last fugitives of the Former Yugoslavia Tribunals was due to cooperative efforts of States  along with the Tribunal’s Prosecutor.  Canada  Australia and New Zealand were particularly concerned with the plight of the nine people acquitted and released by the Rwanda Tribunal  and that of the three who had completed their sentences  and awaited relocation  he said.  He further reiterated their support for the Security Council's decision to establish the Residual Mechanism  which had been integral to ensuring that numerous goals were met.  These included the practical application of criminal justice  the protection of witnesses and the maintenance of Tribunal archives continuing beyond the completion of the Tribunals' respective mandates. MAY-ELIN STENER (Norway)  speaking on behalf of the Nordic counties  applauded the work of the Rwanda and Former Yugoslavia Tribunals  and said that both deserved praise for their work in sexual and gender-based violence.  She expressed hope that the Former Yugoslavia Tribunal’s vast experience would be passed on to relevant stakeholders.  Both Tribunals needed continued support from Member States.  She called on the international community to collectively address the need to relocate acquitted persons  and give the Mechanism sufficient support so it could continue the important function of tracking and prosecuting fugitives and conducting appeals  retrials and trials for contempt of court.  The fact that 20 Rwandan fugitives still remained at large must be addressed  and she strongly encouraged Member States to intensify their efforts in this area. MILAN MILANOVIĆ (Serbia) said that his country had made important contributions to making the Former Yugoslavia Tribunal more efficient than most international criminal tribunals  not just by apprehending the last remaining fugitives  but also by diligently providing documents to the Tribunal and enabling witnesses to testify.  The Government of Serbia was committed to continuing cooperation with both the Tribunal and with the Residual Mechanism.  Pending cases had to be completed as soon as possible.  Justice could not be served without the cooperation of the countries on whose territory the crimes were committed.  Serbia had shown readiness to accept its nationals to serve their sentences  and promoted an initiative on the matter  as the Government could see no reason for the continued implementation of the 1993 recommendation of the Secretary-General providing for the enforcement of sentences outside the territory of the former Yugoslavia. DRAGANA ANĐELIĆ (Bosnia and Herzegovina) said it would continue to cooperate with the Former Yugoslavia Tribunal and with the Residual Mechanism  by allowing access to documents and archives and providing support in the field of witness protection  as well as for all necessary administrative and judicial work.  Bosnia and Herzegovina continued to promote regional cooperation.  On 26 April  it  and Montenegro  signed the Protocol on Cooperation in Prosecution of Perpetrators of War Crimes  Crimes against Humanity and Genocide.  Last year  the Office of the Prosecutor of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Office of the Prosecutor of Croatia signed protocols on the exchange of evidence and information on war crimes.  Continued regional cooperation was a precondition for reconciliation in the region.  In light of the classification of sexual abuse as an integral part of the Statute of the International Criminal Court  she welcomed the Court’s decision that 56 per cent of the professional staff and 53 per cent of the Mechanism's staff must be female. ANA CRISTINA RODRÍGUEZ PINEDA (Guatemala) recognized the achievements of the Tribunals  including in advancing international criminal law  but said that much remained to be done before they could close their doors.  The situation of those who had been acquitted should remain a priority.  The functioning of the Residual Mechanism ensured that the eventual closure of both Tribunals would not leave the door open for future impunity.  The Residual Mechanism set an excellent example because it struck a balance between the need to respect due process and justice  and the requirement of efficiency and cost-effectiveness.  To those who noted the low number of persons tried by the Tribunals  as well as the Tribunals' high cost  she said that the administration of justice could not be measured in monetary terms alone.  Justice was priceless.  The deterrent effect of Tribunals should also be noted.  The United Nations should not sacrifice international peace and security owing to budgetary concerns.  Given that one of Tribunals would soon conclude  it was timely to reflect on the impact the Tribunals had had  not just in advancing international criminal law  but in advancing the principles of the United Nations. USMAN SARKI (Nigeria) recalled that  since the Security Council’s adoption of resolution 2150 (2014)  all Member States had the duty to cooperate with the Rwanda Tribunal  the Mechanism and the Government of Rwanda in the arrest and prosecution of the remaining fugitives.  A welcome development was the appearance of the Rwandan fugitives on the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) list.  Continued attention had to be paid to the preparation and submission of archives to the Mechanism because it faced major challenges.  The Tribunal had completed proceedings  but Nigeria was concerned about the late arrests of certain individuals and other issues that would impact the 31 December deadline.  The Assembly had the duty to revisit the subject of extension of Former Yugoslavia Tribunal judges before the end of the year.  He called on the Mechanism to continue to work closely with the Tribunals to endure a smooth transition. CAROL HAMILTON (United States) said that reconciliation was not possible without accountability or truth  which work of the Tribunals had gone far towards ensuring.  The work of the Rwanda Tribunal was now complete  and that of the Former Yugoslavia Tribunal was also impressive  with just nine cases remaining.  The Tribunal had worked hard to expedite those proceedings without sacrificing due process and the rights of the accused.  He commended the Tribunals’ efforts in the past several years to wind down operations and transfer their remaining workload to the Mechanism.  The contribution of the Tribunals could not be overstated  she said  as they had made immeasurable contributions to the development of international law in ensuring accountability for genocide  from recognizing rape as a crime against humanity to compiling data on how to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity.  They had not just brought justice to the communities they were serving  but had brought the international community closer to the day when the words never again could be said with certainty. EVGENY ZAGAYNOV (Russian Federation) said his country had carefully followed the efforts of the Former Yugoslavia Tribunal to meet its timetable  but recent developments had shown that might not be possible.  The Appeals judgement recently handed down in that Court confirmed the importance of adhering to the principles of justice.  Also in the case of the Rwanda Tribunal  instead of early completion of the Butare case  there was an additional delay.  He cautioned against the use of technical issues to draw out the process.  He also urged the Rwanda Tribunal to pay closer attention and conclude its work within its allocated budget.  He called on both Tribunals to transfer any tasks it could to the Mechanism as soon as possible.  It was important that the Tribunals continue to carry on bilateral work in their respective regions. JEANNE D'ARC BYAJE (Rwanda) commended the Former Yugoslavia Tribunal and the Rwanda Tribunal for their contributions to the fight against impunity.  Requesting that the archives of the Rwanda Tribunal be hosted by her country  she noted concern that no progress had been made on tracking the three key remaining genocide suspects.  Naming other cases about which her Government had concerns  she noted that justice delayed was justice denied.  Reiterating her call on all to fight genocide denial  which took forms such as using the term the Rwandan genocide  she said that this gave a pretext to revisionists and scholars from Western countries to mislead the public into thinking that the genocide that occurred in Rwanda was perpetrated against a national group  Rwandans  killing each other.  The terminology established by the Rwanda Tribunal was to call it genocide against the Tutsis  in which Hutus and others who opposed genocide were also killed. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-10,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gal3478.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Access to justice must be ensured if a society were to be truly based on the rule of law  Sixth (Legal) Committee delegations emphasized today as they continued their deliberations on the principle and shared national practices. Lebanon’s representative said access to justice was deeply rooted in his country’s law  with the Constitution ensuring the right to have one’s case heard by an impartial and competent tribunal.  Stressing that access to justice required people’s awareness of the law  he said that legislation only came into effect after being publicized in the official journal. Like other delegations  Thailand’s representative also stressed that States had the primary responsibility to provide equitable access to justice  especially to vulnerable groups.  To raise awareness on that access  information on people’s rights to State compensation was being disseminated and made available in every provincial justice office in the country. In addition to raising awareness  many delegations pointed to the availability of institutions as a key component in providing access to justice.  In Morocco  that country’s representative said  the office of the Ombudsman  as well as an equity and reconciliation body that addressed human rights violations  were some of the institutions that facilitated access to justice for Moroccan citizens. Similarly  the delegate of Peru cited the implementation of a public defence service in his country that provided counsel to the indigent and vulnerable  and the ombudsman’s offices that provided support to those seeking redress from misconduct by the Government.  Those were some of the ways in which his country had achieved significant progress in providing fair  transparent  non-discriminatory legal services. Delegations also stressed that  when addressing the needs of marginalized persons  it was critical that legal services be affordable in order to ensure the provision of access to justice. The representative of the United Republic of Tanzania noted that established advocates in her country were encouraged to take on pro-bono cases on behalf of the poor  marginalized and vulnerable groups.  As well  a bill underway would not only facilitate Government contribution to legal aid  but also recognize paralegals as an important group that provides legal assistance and counselling in rural areas  making access to justice a reality. Echoing his counterpart  South Africa’s representative said that his country was a leading advocate for improved access to counsel for indigent and marginalized persons.  In June of this year  the first large scale International Conference on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems had been convened in Johannesburg to address challenges in the provision of legal aid for the criminally accused. Despite such efforts  legal aid could and should go beyond the criminal justice system  said the United States’ representative.  He encouraged the Committee to include promoting access to health and housing  education and employment  and fostering family stability and community well-being  as States pursued societies based on the rule of law. Also speaking were representatives of Nicaragua  Ukraine  Ethiopia  Vietnam  Philippines  Argentina  Senegal  Brazil  Zambia  Kyrgyzstan  Burkina Faso  Slovenia  Nigeria  Estonia  Turkey  Myanmar  Algeria  Guinea  Maldives  Sri Lanka  Tonga  Indonesia  Bangladesh  Iran  Austria  China  Syria  Mexico  Eritrea  Montenegro  India  Tunisia  Zimbabwe  Mozambique  Armenia  Sierra Leone  Georgia  Malawi and Kuwait.  A representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross also participated. The Committee will meet to conclude consideration of strengthening the rule of law on the national and international levels and to take up the Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the work of its forty-seventh session at 10:00 a.m. on Monday  13 October. Background The Sixth Committee would continue its deliberations on the rule of law at the national and international levels.  For background see Press Release GA/L/3477. Statements Mr. HITTI (Lebanon) said that access to justice was deeply embedded in Lebanese law  noting that the preamble to his country’s Constitution ensured the right to have one’s case heard by an impartial and competent tribunal.  Furthermore  Lebanese legislation guaranteed the right for any individual  whether Lebanese or foreign  to seek remedy before the courts.  As access to justice also implied knowledge of the law  Lebanese law went into effect once it was publicized in the official journal.  The country was enhancing collaboration with non-governmental organizations  civil society and United Nations bodies to ensure greater visibility of its legal arsenal to foreigners.  Among those efforts was a unified contract to protect domestic migrant workers.  The country was also following the work of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. LILIAN A. MUKASA (United Republic of Tanzania)  associating herself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said a brand new Constitution had been recently endorsed by the Constituent Assembly  and citizens were expected to vote in a referendum to approve it.  She noted that the Secretary-General’s report stated that a major obstacle to accessing justice was the cost involved in legal aid and representation services.  In that regard  her Government had made deliberate efforts to increase the number of State attorneys  judges  and magistrates  as well as build new courts and renovate old ones.  Established advocates were being encouraged to take up pro-bono cases on behalf of the poor  marginalized  and vulnerable groups.  A bill underway would not only facilitate Government contribution to legal aid provision in the country  but also recognize paralegals as an important cadre to provide legal assistance and counselling in rural areas  making access to justice a reality. JUANA SANDOVAL (Nicaragua)  associating herself with the Non-Aligned Movement and Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  said that among her country’s core principles were the search for peace and the right to self-determination  and she expressed support for the Palestinian people and their right to use all legal means to that end.  Always seeking peaceful means to resolve disputes  she pointed out her country’s recourse to the International Court of Justice.  Nicaragua was party to numerous sub-regional  regional and international instruments.  Rejecting unilateral measures  such as the blockade of Cuba  she demanded it be lifted.  Such unilateral actions undermined the rule of law  which must start with reform of the United Nations.  It was necessary to consolidate the central role of the General Assembly as the sole body with universal membership.  On a national level  there were Citizens’ Councils giving the people a voice in the country’s political life.  She called on all countries that had not done so to recognize the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. OLEKSANDR PAVLICHENKO (Ukraine) said that the matter at hand had special importance to his country  as the United Nations Monitoring Mission in Ukraine had found serious problems with the rule of law  including wide-scale corruption  systematic police and law enforcement abuses  and lack of an independent judiciary.  Nonetheless  despite ongoing foreign aggression  his country had conducted transparent and fair elections.  The President had identified areas of reforms in the judiciary  tax  entrepreneurship regulation  and health care sectors  to name a few  and had emphasized that those reforms must be realized by all branches of power  civil society and business.  A lack of responsibility and impunity for human rights violations and treaties had been among the main causes of aggression in his country and attempted annexation of Crimea.  Unfortunately  despite support by almost all Member States  an abuse of the veto power had blocked any practical measures by the Security Council.  In taking advantage of the veto power  that Member State had committed an aggression against his country.  The veto power of permanent members of the Council was not a privilege  but a duty and responsibility to take care of global peace and security.  Abuse of it undermined the authority and credibility of the United Nations.  In that regard  he welcomed the initiative related to non-use of the veto in case of mass atrocities. YIDNEKACHEW GEBRE-MESKEL ZEWDU (Ethiopia)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said that the challenge was not “the general expression of commitment to the rule of law”  but ensuring practice to the rule of law.  Over the past 20 years  his country had made progress to establish the rule of law as the basis of governance  and citizens now counted on the State to carry out its obligations.  The country was strengthening democratic institutions and building capacity of the civil service and civil society and the participation of the public at all levels of governance.  Further  Ethiopia had come a long way in strengthening law enforcement institutions.  Still  there was far to go in implementing the rule of law.  To that end  he welcomed and appreciated support from the United Nations and Member States  particularly towards capacity-building. PHAM QUANG HIEU (Viet Nam)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  said that his country  as an ASEAN member State  had actively contributed to and remained committed to further intensifying its efforts towards a politically cohesive  economically integrated and socially responsible ASEAN Community.  ASEAN  which would become a rules-based Community in 2015  would help build a region of peace  stability and prosperity founded upon international law  and develop common rules and norms for the region.  He emphasized the importance of full implementation of the Declaration on the Code of Conduct of parties in the South China Sea.  As well  his country had revised its Constitution  aiming to further facilitate the building of a law-governed State. LIBRAN N. CABACTULAN (Philippines)  associating himself with ASEAN and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that his country had a comprehensive legal framework on access to justice  and gave an overview of a number of its provisions. Among them were the right of indigents to defence counsel; an interface between informal and formal justice systems; and a shari’a system in place in Muslim Mindanao.  He had presented the Philippines’ position on the peaceful settlement of the disputes in the South China Sea in a letter to the Secretary-General  and called for State parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to clearly define and publicize the limits of their respective maritime zones.  The Philippine approach to resolving the “provocative and destabilizing activities” in the South China Sea called for  among other things  the cessation of specific activities that escalated tensions and recourse to arbitration in resolving the issue.  Although another State party to UNCLOS had been invited to do so  it had rejected that peaceful invitation. FERNANDA MILLICAY (Argentina)  associating herself with CELAC  said that she welcomed “access to justice” being made part of goal 16 of the Sustainable Development Goals.  However  she would have preferred a much more ambitious goal  one that included all human rights.  She underscored the importance of regional cooperation and coordination mechanisms in promoting the rule of law in Latin America  in particular the adoption of democratic clauses.  In the peaceful settlement of disputes  the International Court of Justice played a central role.  As well  there were other specialized tribunals  such as the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea  whose jurisdiction had been accepted by her country.  She emphasized that third parties to a dispute must refrain from conduct that could frustrate the fulfilment by parties of their obligation to peacefully resolve the dispute. IBRAHIMA SORY SYLLA (Senegal)  associating with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  said his country was working towards a rule of law system based on human rights  and individual and collective liberty.  A free and independent press and a democratic society formed a solid basis for Senegalese society.  Still  there were concerns regarding corruption in the country.  To that end  a court on the repression of illicit enrichment had been established  as well as a national office on fraud and corruption.  In addition  there was a national committee on the restitution of illegally gained assets.  His Government had introduced a new concept of courts that would inform people of their rights and duties  and initiate action towards conclusion of conflicts.  It was important to share best practices  bearing in mind the specifics of institutional development in each country. MOHAMMED ATLASSI (Morocco)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said that his country  already a party to many conventions and treaties  had committed to ratifying other instruments aimed at protecting human health and the environment.  Morocco was also one of the first countries to sign the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Since its independence  it had aimed to increase the performance of its institutions and consolidation of the rule of law.  It had created the institution of Moroccan Ombudsman  reformed the family code to improve the status of women  and had implemented an equity and reconciliation body to undertake inquiries into human rights violations and reparations.  As well  a new Constitution had been adopted by referendum  which underscored respect for human rights  and reform of the justice system and access to justice had been implemented  in order to ensure equality for its citizens. THEMBILE JOYINI (South Africa)  associating himself with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that access to justice and the rule of law could be strengthened through the provision of legal aid  particularly for the poor and vulnerable.  As an original sponsor of the “United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in the Criminal Justice Systems”  adopted by the General Assembly in 2012  his country was a leading advocate for improved access to counsel for indigent and marginalized persons.  In June of this year  the first large scale International Conference on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems was convened in Johannesburg to address challenges in the provision of legal aid for the criminally accused.  Pointing out that “access to justice” was included in goal 16 of the proposed Sustainable Development  he said the rule of law should uplift the disadvantaged in society through the provision of essential services and the fulfilment of socio-economic rights.  The international community must also be governed by a system in which international law was equally enforced and independently adjudicated.  Although Member States’ judicial systems had different approaches  priorities and cultures  the right to free legal assistance to criminal defendants unable to afford a lawyer was an essential component of the right to a fair trial. ANTONIO DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil)  associating himself with CELAC  said that ensuring national ownership was key in the promotion of the rule of law and in strengthening institutional capacities in pursuit of sustainable development.  His country had adopted legislation and policy to foster alternative dispute resolution methods  recognizing that mediation and reconciliation was quicker and had a less budgetary impact.  Also  that method was based on actual engagement by parties  and thus led to a high rate of acceptance and spontaneous compliance.  He underscored that no single country was exempt from compliance with its obligations.  Reform of the Security Council was needed to ensure effective and fair representation.  In addition  the lack of funding for the Programme of Assistance  whose main purpose was to foster the rule of law  must be overcome  he stated  stressing that education in international law was a cornerstone of lasting peace. MWABA P. KASESE-BOTA (Zambia)  aligning her delegation with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  pointed to her country’s construction of legal aid offices in all provincial centres  ensuring the right to a free and fair trial.  In addition  a Small Claims Court had been established as evidence of Zambia’s strong adherence to the rule of law.  Her Government had instituted several initiatives and laws  including the Anti-Gender-based Violence Act  the establishment of several judicial oversight institutions  and the adoption of zero tolerance for corruption.  On an international level  she pointed to Zambia’s contribution of troops and other personnel to conflicts worldwide  and pledged their continued assistance.  However  the need for reform of the Security Council was underscored  as the governing structure of the United Nations must give equal comfort to all its members. NURAN NIYAZALIEV (Kyrgyzstan) said that his country’s National Strategy for Sustainable Development  which outlined the way forward for 2013-2017  identified as main priorities the formation of a State governed by the rule of law  with guarantees of law enforcement and the advancement of its citizens’ legal culture. Moreover  last year  the country had adopted a State Program for the Development of the Judicial System for 2013-2017.  Providing the rule of law and human rights remained a difficult challenge for developing countries due to the lack of resources to support relevant institutions and mechanisms in need of reform  he said  calling for those factors to be considered within the framework of the United Nations and multilateral partnership. NORACHIT SINHASENI (Thailand)  associating himself with ASEAN and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that dialogue among States on advancing the rule of law was crucial to enhancing national practices and the global effort to strengthen the principle.  For that reason  Thailand had hosted the “Bangkok Dialogue on the Rule of Law: Investing in the Rule of Law  Justice and Security for the Post-2015 Development Agenda”.  States had the primary responsibility to provide equitable access to justice and promoting and protecting the rights of all people  especially vulnerable groups.  To that end  his country was disseminating information on people’s rights to State compensation  available in every provincial justice office in the country  and was requiring all State organs to perform their duties based on the rule of law  without discrimination.  Measures had also been taken to provide basic healthcare and humane treatment to women offenders  as well as towards their rehabilitation  among others.  He then enumerated recent ratification of several international instruments  and how domestic laws were being amended to meet international obligations. DER KOGDA (Burkina Faso)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said that advancement of the rule of law at the international level could prosper only if it were linked to a State’s national plan.  Since his country’s establishment of a democratic system  it had worked to regularly hold elections  and established institutions and other entities to enable their citizens to thrive and to protect their human rights.  Since 2006  a process of integral decentralization had been established to allow local populations be  by themselves and for themselves  creators of their own social and economic development.  The Government and its partners had worked to strengthen human capacity and had supported development initiatives of local collectives.  As well  it had adopted a national plan of justice to strengthen the judiciary’s independence.  A host of laws had also been created to provide legal assistance to the disadvantaged and establish legal clinics. ANDREJ LOGAR (Slovenia)  associating himself with the European Union  said that as there were no peaceful societies without accessible and accountable justice  there could not be any significant sustainable development without the rule of law fight against corruption.  Special attention should be devoted to the prevention of mass atrocities and the fight against impunity  and it was Member States’ shared responsibility to implement all three pillars of the principle of the responsibility to protect.  His country  as a contact point for the Eastern European Group on the ratification of the Kampala amendments  had organized with Liechtenstein a regional seminar on the matter.  The International Criminal Court was essential in the establishment of the rule of law  he said  calling upon States to ratify or accede to the Rome Statute. TOPE ADE ELIAS-FATILE (Nigeria)  associating himself with the African Group  said his country’s Constitution provided the basis for a rule-of-law approach to governance at the national level.  Its law-making process was people-oriented and particularly sensitive to the needs of the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups in society.  It had implemented relevant international instruments and recommended practices  such as the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act 2011  to promote an open Government  as well as the Terrorism Prevention Act of 2011 and the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act of 2011  to give impetus to the global fight against terrorism  terrorist financing and economic crimes.  Nigerian courts  as a result of its constitutional provisions  had traditionally been known to be objective  non-partisan and unbiased in the delivery of justice.  Its judicial system continued to play a pivotal role in the advancement and elaboration of people’s rights through effective oversight of the actions of the executive and legislative branches of Government.  The judiciary’s role as the final arbiter among the three branches of Government in the electoral process thus created an enabling environment for peace and stability to thrive in his country. STEPHEN TOWNLEY (United States) stressed that Member States should seek a “tangible  step by step progress” in United Nations forums in furthering of the rule of law.  An example was the recent verdict from the Trial Chambers of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Court of Cambodia  which marked an important step forward to secure justice for that country’s people.  Much more work needed to be done  however  and the Organization should bolster its support for the Chambers.  Since his country’s 2012 pledge to address domestic violence  protections to victims in Native American communities had been extended  better rape investigation tools to law enforcement had been provided  and new initiatives to combat sexual assault among young people had been implemented.  His Government supported the United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in the Criminal Justice Systems  but noted that legal aid “can and should” go beyond the criminal justice system.  That should include promoting access to health and housing  education and employment  and fostering family stability and community well-being.  Using the United States Legal Services Corporation Act as an example  he highlighted the value of civil legal aid in the access to justice for all Member states. GUSTAVO MEZA-CUADRA (Peru)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and CELAC  said that his country had achieved significant progress in establishing fair  transparent  non-discriminatory legal services and promoting access to justice for all  including the most vulnerable.  He cited as examples  among others  the implementation of a public defence service that provided counsel to the indigent and vulnerable; a variety of means to settle disputes; and ombudsman’s offices providing support to those seeking redress from governmental misconduct.  Rule of law  nationally and internationally  was important to sustaining human growth  particularly in the areas of justice and economic reform.  He hailed the final document of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  which should form the basis for the formulating of those goals. GERT AUVAART (Estonia)  associating himself with the European Union  said effective and accountable institutions were powerful enablers for sustainable development  in which modern digital technology played a valuable role.  In that regard  his country had developed an e-governance system that increased transparency and helped eliminate corruption.  It had offered such a system to all countries  and would continue to do so.  Noting the International Criminal Court’s important role  especially in the quest to end impunity  he called on countries that had not yet done so to join the Rome Statute  and urged State Parties to ratify the Kampala amendments. IPEK ZEYTINOGLU OZKAN (Turkey) said that structural reforms in her country in the field of rule of law and good governance had paved the way for increased direct foreign investment and sustained economic growth.  An independent judiciary enforcing fair laws based on the principle of equality had built citizens’ trust in the administration of justice  which was key to a stable  prosperous society.  Since the start of the 2000s  Turkey’s judiciary had been reinforced to guarantee fundamental rights and freedoms  strengthening its independence  impartiality and effectiveness.  As a country that had recently experienced profound economic progress and democratic advancement  she offered to share best practices in the field of access to justice and the rule of law. U PAW LWIN SEIN (Myanmar) said that since the present Government had taken office  rapid development of legislation had occurred  thanks to legal reform measures.  Listing recent laws which had been enacted or had come into force  as well as commissions put into place  he noted Myanmar’s mindfulness that all national laws must be in line with international law.  His country welcomed capacity-building programmes and technical assistance from the United Nations system for law enforcement institutions.  In addition  a National Human Rights Commission recently had been established where people could file complaints of their rights’ violations.  As well  Myanmar had recently signed  ratified or acceded to numerous international instruments  including the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York Convention). MOHAMED SALAH EDDINE BELAID (Algeria)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  called for United Nations reforms that would promote the rule of law at a global level  such as a “more harmonious balance” between the General Assembly and the Security Council  and comprehensive reform of the Security Council to correct “the historical injustice done to the African Continent”.  Algeria had ratified or joined all major international treaties and conventions  and integrated their provisions in its own legal system.  In addition  his Government had made efforts towards incorporating the rule of law nationally  by strengthening democracy and access to justice  advancing human rights  and building a strong economy.  Algeria was ranked first in the Arab and Muslim world for female representation in the National Assembly  at 31.6 per cent.  The country played a decisive role in the stabilization of the volatile Maghreb-Shael region  and had assisted in eradicating terrorism and restoring peace and security among its neighbours. Mr. BALDE (Guinea)  associating himself with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that his Government had proclaimed 2013 as the year of justice.  Satisfactory results had emerged from that strategy  including the establishment of a high judiciary council of judges  tasked with guaranteeing the professionalism of their peers  including the imposition of sanctions for wrongdoing in exercise of their functions.  As well  better living conditions for judges were granted to remove the temptation of corruption and guarantee judiciary independence.  Court buildings had also been reconstructed following their destruction in 2006.  His country had also carried out genuine reform in its defence and security sectors.  Specific courses were being given in the maintenance of order  integrating all aspects of international humanitarian law and human rights law.  The success of that reform had allowed the strengthening of its armed and peacekeeping forces in the country and in the rest of world.  Investigations following massacres and rapes carried out in 2009 by the security forces of the military junta had culminated in the indictment of responsible individuals. AISHATH SHAHULA (Maldives) said that  with complete separation of power  his country was “staunchly and unyieldingly” committed to the rule of law.  Peaceful multi-party elections had been held in 2013  and during the past six years  laws and policies that ensured basic social protection of those most in need had been enacted.  Listing recent national legislation  her Government had entered into force instruments that addressed domestic violence  human trafficking  and other measures aimed at protecting the most vulnerable people in society.  She also noted international human rights mechanisms to which her country was party.  Democratization was realized through a partnership between the State and the governed  and it was imperative that the rule of law remained meaningfully integrated in the post-2015 development agenda. PALITHA KOHONA (Sri Lanka) said that in accommodating cultural  ethnic and religious disparities within its legal framework  his country’s Constitutional provisions had contributed to the promotion and protection of many groups  including minority groups.  Among access to justice available to Sri Lankans  an aggrieved person could invoke the judiciary by those provisions without the assistance of an attorney.  Recent efforts by the international community to tackle the threat of terrorism had brought difficulties in balancing national and security concerns with human rights obligations.  The United Nations role with regard to institutionalizing multilateralism had been critical  and the Charter’s emphasis on national sovereignty and non-interference in the domestic affairs of states was the bulwark of the current international order. MAHE U.S. TUPOUNIUA (Tonga) said that his country participated in the Pacific Judicial Development Programme  which aimed to strengthen governance and rule of law in the region through enhanced access to justice and independent judicial officers.  Tonga also had taken steps to facilitate women’s participation in the judicial sphere through UN Women’s “Advancing Gender Justice in the Pacific Programme”.  At the international level  he said that with disappearing islands and territories negatively impacting borders and the resultant potential for vast movements of people seeking refuge from the threat  the Security Council should see climate change as a threat to international peace and security  and decide on the appropriate behaviour of States in that regard.  The International Court of Justice and the International Tribunal Law of the Sea were of great importance in developing environmental law and law of the sea.  Their past judgments had established a due diligence standard in environmental international law that played a key role in climate change issues  and their advisory powers were also important to the management of seabed resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction. ARY APRIANTO (Indonesia)  associating himself with ASEAN and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that access to justice was mandated by the Indonesian Constitution  and was one of the country’s five philosophical foundations.  That had evolved from providing public access to legal aid to the total reform of the Indonesian legal system.  He stressed that legal reform should follow the character of the people  their customs  traditions and values.  The country’s national strategy on access to justice  which focused on making human and institutional capacity-building a priority and strengthening transparency in the legislative process  entailed a long-term effort to strengthen the values of social justice in the legal curricula and ongoing training for law enforcement officials  among other measures.  It also entailed strengthening transparency in the legislative process through increased participation by civil society  educational institutions and other stakeholders.  Creating a sense of ownership encouraged people to speak out in defence of their rights.  Attention had also been given to women’s access to justice. A.K. ABDUL MOMEN (Bangladesh)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)  said that his country  the world’s seventh largest democracy  had undertaken national reforms to promote the rule of law.  It had strengthened its Anti-Corruption Commission  established a Human Rights Commission and formed an Information Commission to provide free information access.  In 2013  the Government had passed the Neuro Development Disabilities Act to ensure the rights of persons with disabilities  and the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act to protect people in custody.  Bangladesh was the top troop and police contributor to United Nations Peacekeeping missions  but also a supporter of peaceful resolution of conflict.  He called on Member states to not encourage a ‘double standard’ or selective application of laws  and to encourage mediation and constructive dialogues. HOSSEIN GHARIBI (Iran)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that his country’s Constitution guaranteed the indisputable right of every citizen to seek justice.  Everyone could refer matters to competent courts  and no one could be barred from courts to which he had a legal right of recourse.  The Constitution also provided that parties to a lawsuit had the right to select an attorney  and if they were unable to do so  arrangements must be made to provide them with legal counsel.  The Code of Criminal Procedure provided for the appointment of a public defender  whenever the court deemed that the defendant could not afford to hire an attorney.  In grave crimes  an attorney for the accused was mandatory; in cases when the accused was unable to have his own attorney  the court appointed a Government-paid public defender.  To facilitate access to justice across the country  the judiciary had operated the electronic network to allow the filing of civil claims online at the disposal of every citizen.  The new system had made access to justice considerably faster and easier with increased transparency. STEPHEN MATTHIAS KOPPANYI (Austria)  aligning with the European Union  said that international law and the rule of law were the foundations of the international system.  A strong supporter of the International Criminal Court  Austria had recently ratified the Kampala amendments to its Statute.  International human rights treaties should be internationalized.  Since access to justice was an important element of the rule of law  Austria welcomed the Secretary-General’s report.  Good governance and the rule of law were essential for economic growth and sustainable development  and were therefore crucial elements for the success of the post-2015 development agenda.  Austria’s efforts to promote the rule of law did not serve an abstract goal  but the protection of the rights and interests of individuals. LI YONGSHENG (China) recalled that this year was the 60th anniversary of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence  which his country had co-initiated with Myanmar and India  incorporating the rule of law as one of the operating principles.  He expressed hope that future work on the principle by the United Nations would be “more open and transparent”.  His country was pressing forward with comprehensive development of the rule of law in accordance with its strategy of governing by law  with a view to building a socialist country with the rule of law.  He cited examples from 1984 to the present for the waiving  postponement and reduction of litigation fees  noting that from 2008 to 2012 Chinese courts had waived or reduced 769 million renminbi yuan of litigation fees.  China also enhanced the system of crime victim assistance  with the justice system providing 25 996 victims more than 350 million renminbi yuan in relief funds between 2009 and 2011.  It was currently exploring a system of relief in judgment enforcement for winning parties.  A structure of legal aid had “basically taken shape” as a result of nearly two decades of development. KOUSSAY ABDULJABBAR ALDAHHAK (Syrian Arab Republic)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  emphasized that it was neither possible nor acceptable to insist on rule of law only in certain countries.  Obstacles were due to selectivity  double standards and the politicization of issues that certain countries engaged in.  Certain countries had broad definitions of concepts that did not enjoy consensus in the international community.  Certain countries in the region supported the terrorism from which his country was suffering  counter to the rule of law  sending in mercenaries from around the world whose extremist ideas had nothing to do with any religion  civilization or humanity  and whose barbaric atrocities upon the people of Syria and Iraq  as well as from other countries  constituted a threat to the region and the world.  Unfortunately  the Organization’s failure to hold those countries accountable was not in keeping with what those countries claimed was the rule of law.  The principle was not compatible with the unilateral imposition of opinions on other countries  including his  he said  and it could not reign while the Syrian Golan and other Palestinian territories were occupied  nor while the occupying authority continued to commit atrocities. Mr. SOUSA (Mexico)  associating himself with CELAC  said that rule of law was a cross-cutting subject that touched on various aspects of the General Assembly’s work.  In that regard  it was impractical to limit its consideration to the Sixth Committee alone.  There could be no sound rule of law without modern and efficient institutions.  As part of reforms his country had undertaken  a code for criminal procedures was in place  which would enable the uniform application of judicial criteria.  Stressing the importance of national ownership  he said Member States must lead rule of law processes.  The more than 400 voluntary pledges made relating to the High Level Declaration reflected a plethora of opportunities to make progress on the rule of law and a high quality of experiences in dealing with its promotion.  His country stood ready to share its experiences in that regard. HELENE AWET WOLDEYOHANNES (Eritrea)  associating herself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said that the international dimension of the rule of law needed greater attention  as it was seriously impacting Eritrea’s national effort to strengthen its normative frameworks and capable institutions.  Nationally  she said community courts enhanced people’s access to justice at lower cost  thus providing access to the larger community  including to the poor.  Further  recent changes to the jurisdiction of courts  refinements of procedural laws and new laws strengthening enforcement gave citizens access to judicial services where they lived.  Towards empowering women  female genital mutilation and underage marriage had been criminalized.  Women’s right to own property and equal pay for equal work had been entrenched in law  and 30 per cent of parliamentary seats were reserved for women.  Social justice initiatives also included reducing the disparity between rural and urban populations.  As well  efforts were underway to bridge the gender and diversity gap. MILORAD ŠCEPANOVIĆ (Montenegro)  associating himself with the European Union  stressed the individual responsibility of countries to strengthen the rule of law and promote human rights  as well as the role of the United Nations in providing support to those efforts.  He acknowledged the importance of the International Criminal Court and other international tribunals in fighting impunity.  The rule of law and a well-functioning justice sector supported inclusive growth and development.  Improving access to justice  reducing violence  promoting human rights and ensuring effective  fair and accountable institutions were important to developing and developed countries alike.  All countries could improve in those areas.  Impartial access to justice and the fight against impunity were essential elements in the nexus between rule of law and development  which was why it was important that the post-2015 development agenda apply to rich and poor countries alike. M. KOTESWARA RAO (India) reaffirmed the role of an independent  efficient  competent  national and “exclusively” sovereign system as the means to solve conflicts  ensure accountability and provide redress.  As outlined in the Declaration of the Rule of Law  all States should settle their differences by peaceful means  but it was essential that the Security Council undergo reform to make it broadly representative and transparent.  The 1947 adoption of the Indian Constitution guaranteed fundamental rights and freedoms to all citizens  including the right to a fair public hearing before an independent judicial body  and  since 1987  the provision of free legal aid.  New pro-active measures to promote access to justice had been undertaken  including the right to initiate legal proceedings through petition.  He pointed to the need for reform at the United Nations and its bodies  where there was “an abiding deficit of the rule of law in the institutions of global governance”. NOUR ZARROUK BOUMIZA (Tunisia) said her country had developed a new Constitution  which was ratified in January of this year  that would lay the groundwork for a real democracy.  It included a separation of Government powers and access to justice  which also required the independence of the judiciary.  There is a new Constitutional court  which would contribute to protecting the freedoms and rights of their citizens.  Important strides in transitional justice were also being taken  with a new law in 2013 holding people responsible and accountable for harm.  The Truth and Dignity Authority  which investigated serious violations of human rights  and a programme to compensate victims of harm  had also been established.  Tunisia had proposed an international constitutional court to provide advice to all nations coming out of occupation  and to prevent rule of force.  She voiced hope it would find support from Member States. FREDERICK SHAVA (Zimbabwe)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said that the tendency to resort to force undermined development  peace  security  human rights and the rule of law.  Recent experience demonstrated that heavy handed interventions did not always bring about sustainable solutions  but instead cost lives  destroyed and degraded economic and social infrastructure and often left behind more unstable situations than those that had been intended to be resolved.  He cautioned States to avoid the use of unilateral punitive sanctions  from which his country suffered  as they undermined stability and socio-economic development  and expressed concern that the international criminal justice system operated in a selective manner  undermining confidence in it.  Nationally  he said the new “home grown” Constitution emphasized the separation of powers and the independence of judicial institutions.  All laws were being realigned with the new Constitution  and independent bodies had been set up in areas such as human rights  anti-corruption and media. ANTÓNIO GUMENDE (Mozambique)  associating with the Africa Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  said the international community should promote ratification and full implementation of core international treaties  concomitant with the required support some Member States might require for the latter.  In that context  he acknowledged the growing role of international institutions in upholding the rule of law  mainly in the field of international humanitarian law and the United Nations pledge to combat impunity.  At the national level  Mozambique had reviewed its Constitution and consolidated its fundamental guiding principles  thus advancing the democratic rule of law founded on freedom of expression  free political party affiliation and respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens.  Further  the country was also consolidating the role of oversight institutions and strengthening individual guarantees through an ombudsman’s office.  Mozambique had also strengthened its anti-corruption legislation and established administrative courts in every province.  Those reforms had been preceded by public consultations. ZOHRAB MNATSAKANYAN (Armenia) said that as a nation that had experienced the first genocide of the twentieth century and continued to face its denial  Armenia reaffirmed its support for the fight against impunity for the most serious crimes  such as genocide and crimes against humanity.  Further  promoting the rule of law internationally was only possible if there were a strong domestic foundation.  Armenia’s Constitution guaranteed equality of all persons before the law  as well as equal access to justice.  Following independence  broad reforms and institution building had been needed.  One of the key building blocks had been the creation of a more efficient  effective  and independent judiciary.  To that end  a three-tiered structure of courts of general jurisdiction had been established.  A Constitutional amendment in 2005 aimed at ensuring greater judicial independence  and further reforms in 2007 introduced a doctrine analogous to precedent in common law systems.  Since last year  public discussions were underway on further improving governance systems and increasing accountability. AMADU KOROMA (Sierra Leone)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Union Group  said his country had endeavoured to implement the rules of law after a devastating civil war lasting 11 years.  The country had been transformed from a fragile to a stable one  and was one of the fastest growing economies in the world.  It had also been able to hold successive general elections  acclaimed free and credible by international observers.  However  the present Ebola outbreak in their country was threatening to reverse the gains they had made so far  and he sought the Members’ support to overcome the deadly disease.  Nationally they had set up a review committee to reform the 20-year-old Constitution.  A hotly debated issue was the death penalty  for which there was now a moratorium.  Steps were being initiated to reform the police and the judiciary with greater access to justice at all levels. Other reforms included developing legal aid programs.  In addition  the new anti-Corruption act gave prosecutorial powers against any Government Minister or senior officials.INGA KANCHAVELI (Georgia) supported an effective interplay between national justice systems and the International Criminal Court in the fight against impunity.  Her country had been working to adjust Georgian legislation to international standards  and among other steps  had ratified the Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute.  Justice sector reforms continued to be a top priority of her Government  including strengthening the independence of the High Council of Justice  and ensuring the participation of judges in the formation of that Council  among other measures to ensure free and separate judicial decision-making.  Other judicial changes had been made to strengthen the institutional independence of the prosecutorial services and to ensure its impartiality.  A new law affording legal aid to citizens had been enacted  and new consultation centres were opened in ethnic regions and outside of major regional centres. CHARLES MSOSA (Malawi)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Africa Group  said that following 30 years of dictatorship under a one-party State where the rule of law was never adhered to and many citizens became victims  his country had achieved multi-party democracy in 1994.  In May 2014  the country held its fifth transparent and internationally recognized elections to choose democratic leaders.  The Malawi Constitution had a bill of rights and the Government ensured that everyone enjoyed human rights.  In case of abuse  citizens had access to a variety of institutions and courts of law to seek redress.  The courts were independent and accessible to all citizens  including the poor and marginalized who were provided legal aid.  At the international level  Malawi was a signatory to the Rome Statute and a member of the International Court of Justice. ABDULAZIZ A M A ALAJMI (Kuwait) said that his country’s judiciary had been independent since the forming of its Constitution in 1961.  He affirmed the Government’s support for the International Court of Justice and other international judicial bodies.  However  Israel had committed violations of laws and norms with its systematic attacks of Gaza  which resulted in more than 2 100 Palestinians victimised.  Israel had continued to impose blockades against Gaza  which were grave violations of the rule of law  and he demanded that the international community enforce the relevant international laws.  He pointed to growing terrorism around the world  and called on the international community to exert all efforts to fight the scourge. Ms. GEOGHEGAN International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)) said that in armed conflict  upholding the rule of law strengthened the effectiveness of international humanitarian law  which States had the primary responsibility to respect and ensure respect for.  That required them to develop clear normative frameworks and strong judicial mechanisms  which included accountability measures  so as to prevent and punish serious violations of international humanitarian law. It was important to include a range of safeguards to ensure that all persons deprived of their liberty were protected from arbitrary detention and denial of their fundamental rights and freedoms.  Such safeguards included regulatory frameworks  such as inspection and complaint mechanisms  as well as judicial guarantees based on international humanitarian law and relevant international law.

2014-10-10,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaspd557.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Petitioners made impassioned appeals for settling the Western Sahara question for a third and final day today  as the Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) considered Morocco’s role and record in the territory. Several petitioners welcomed the political reforms and social and economic development instituted by Morocco in Western Sahara.  One petitioner said Saharan life had now become modern  and many had fled the Frente Polisario camps for Morocco in order to lead a “normal” life. Morocco’s new Constitution outlined an initiative of “advanced regionalization”  aiming to achieve development in all regions of Morocco  including the Sahara region  said another petitioner. Also on the question of Western Sahara  a petitioner said Morocco had presented a “politically credible and balanced solution”  which would garner the support of the international community. At the same time  a number of speakers regretted Morocco’s role in the impasse.  A Saharan student in the United States said that  although the conflict was easy to solve  leading countries in the Security Council were backing Morocco despite the obvious violations occurring in Western Sahara. The Frente Polisario representative to the United Nations  calling Morocco’s occupation of Western Sahara “an affront to the international community”  said the decolonization of Western Sahara could not be deemed a replacement of a European colonizer by an African one.  He urged the United Nations to take a clear stand on the matter. Following the conclusion of hearings from petitioners  the Committee resumed discussions among delegates on decolonization issues  and with the focus remaining on Western Sahara  the representative of Botswana stressed the right of the people there to choose between independence and integration with Morocco  and be given the opportunity to do so through a referendum. The representative of the United Kingdom told the Committee that his country’s relations with its Overseas Territories were based on partnership  shared values and self-determination  which brought mutual benefits and responsibilities. The representative of Pakistan spoke on the unresolved Jammu and Kashmir dispute and said his country was willing to engage India in a comprehensive dialogue to find a peaceful resolution that would normalize relations. The representative of Jordan  calling for an increase in visiting missions to Non-Self-Governing Territories  highlighted the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the establishment of their independent  sovereign and viable State  on the basis of the pre-1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. The representatives of Indonesia  Peru  Burkina Faso  Togo  Equatorial Guinea  Nigeria and Cuba also made statements. Speaking in exercise of the right of reply were representatives of India  United Kingdom  Pakistan  Morocco  Spain and Argentina. The Committee will meet at 10 a.m. on Monday  13 October  to continue its discussions on decolonization issues. Background The Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) met today to continue its consideration of all decolonization issues.  It was expected to hear the remaining petitioners on the question of Western Sahara  and to continue its general debate.  For further background  see Press Release GA/SPD/556 of 9 October. Petitioners on the Question of Western Sahara AHMED NAFAA  Association Citoyennete et development humain de Dakhla  said that  since the beginning of what he called an “artificial conflict” started by Algeria  Morocco had stretched out its hand for reconciliation.  But  Algeria believed Morocco did that from a position of weakness.  On the contrary  Morocco’s strength derived from the justness of its cause.  Algeria continued to pursue “wrong-headed diplomacy” and used billions of dollars in oil revenues to buy off votes for its “insidious campaigns”.  Algeria had no interest in self-determination in Western Sahara because it sought to encircle Morocco.  A successful self-determination exercise  furthermore  might also encourage regions of Algeria to seek their rights.  The problem was between Morocco and Algeria and would require direct negotiations. SAADANI MAALAININ (OCAPROCE International) said that internationally agreed development goals would not be reached because the basic needs of women living in the Tindouf camps were not being met.  Moreover  they were subjected to a “system of terror” by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro (Frente Polisario).  Women in the camps faced numerous problems  which were exacerbated by the diversion by Frente Polisario of international food aid.  She called for an end to the impunity of the Frente Polisario leaders and the implicit cooperation of other leaders in the conflict.  The people of Tindouf had a right to a dignified future  she said  stressing that their suffering went on daily.  Now was the time to end that travesty once and for all  she urged. BRAHIM LAGHZAL  Counseil National de Droits de l’Homme  said he was a former political prisoner and human rights activist.  He described recent institutional steps taken by Morocco in Western Sahara to protect and promote reform measures in such diverse areas as social and economic development and cultural preservation.  In that way  Morocco had defended the rights and aspirations of everyone  including those harbouring separatist agendas  because of its commitment to the principles of openness and transparency. FATIMA MAOULAININE  Association Locale d’Oued Eddahab  highlighted positive progress that had been achieved in Western Sahara since it was administered by Morocco.  Thanks to legislation that encouraged economic development and entrepreneurship in the region  young people were flourishing  she said.  Steps had also been taken to develop the region’s parliamentary system  as well as its infrastructure  including the construction of new hospitals and roads.  Plans were under way to help train young people to enter the labour market  she stated  adding that the region enjoyed the lowest unemployment rate in Morocco.  Further training was planned in order to equalize living standards. MOULAY CHERIF MANNI  Coordination pour la Defense des Valeurs Sacrees  said that since 1975  the Government of Morocco had invested heavily in the development of Western Sahara in various sectors  resulting in marked improvements in its Human Development Indicators and other international measurements.  The exploitation of natural resources  including phosphate mines  was guided by the principle of social development of the local people.  Thus  these activities  contrary to the contention of critics  were within the framework of international law. JEAN-LOUIS ROY  Partenariat International  said that the initiative to resolve the Western Sahara region with more autonomy responded to the basic principles of self-determination  adding that political  legal and social mechanisms to manage resources were crucial for governance of the region.  The Moroccan initiative was supported by the new Moroccan Constitution  which  importantly  covered the rule of law.  Following new reforms outlined in the Constitution  all indications were that the commitments undertaken by Morocco were trustworthy and that the Constitution represented real political will by the Government.  Morocco’s initiative offered a path to a stable future that would bolster diversity and individual freedoms. EL MAMI AHL AHMED BRAHIM  member of the Red Cross in Rabat  called for international pressure on Frente Polisaro to ensure that the refugees in the Tindouf camps could return to Morocco and contribute to national development.  International humanitarian aid was being diverted in a design to prevent a settlement in the region  he added. ADALBERTO C. AGOZONI said Morocco had shown political maturity by proposing autonomy  which was in accordance with the specificities of the region and enjoyed the support of the people.  Western Sahara was never a “no-man’s land” and would always be a constitutive part of the Kingdom of Morocco.  The politically credible and balanced solution would garner the support of the international community. JUVENAL MARCELO URÍZAR ALFARO raised concerns related to the mining sector in Western Sahara.  He disputed allegations that Morocco’s presence there was due exclusively to the presence of phosphates.  Activity had always been undertaken legally in line with international law  he assured.  With respect to the living conditions in Western Sahara  he noted that those were equal to many other capitals in Africa.  Morocco had not abused the resources  as some had accused  but rather  it had used them to benefit the local people. M’HAMED ABBA said that Frente Polisario maintained refugee camps because they were a source of income.  Officials of Algeria and Frente Polisario had transformed the Tindouf camps into “super markets”  where they were selling goods diverted form humanitarian aid.  On behalf of his family and the people in the camps  he called for an international investigation into the matter and asked that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the World Food Programme (WFP) control aid delivery.  He also called on Algeria to agree a census in the camp. PEDRO PINTO LEITE  International Platform of Jurists for East Timor and Stichting Zelfbeschikking West-Sahara  recalled the similarities between the questions of Palestine and Western Sahara:  two illegal occupations  two walls of shame  violation of human and self-determination rights.  “The abject structure”  a three-metre-high wall built by Morocco  was illegal.  The International Court of Justice concluded that the walls built by both Israel and Morocco constituted a violation of international law.  To justify the construction of the wall  Morocco had presented the argument of self-defence  but its purpose was the annexation of Western Sahara.  The wall heavily impacted the Saharans separating families  and with economic  social  cultural and psychological implications.  He asked the Committee to find a way to force Morocco to demolish the wall. AHMED BOUKHARI  Frente Polisario representative to the United Nations  said Morocco’s occupation of Western Sahara represented “an affront to the international community” and must end forthwith.  The African Union and the United Nations Secretary-General had both set the basis for a settlement  but Morocco had been engaged in obstructionism.  The decolonization of Western Sahara could not be deemed a replacement of a European colonizer by an African one.  The United Nations must take a clear stand on the matter  he said  adding that silence and patience amid injustice was an abdication of responsibility. SALKA DAHI BACHIR said she was born and raised in the Saharan refugee camps where she grew up believing international law would solve the Western Sahara conflict.  She maintained that the United Nations should not ignore the fact that the Moroccan occupation of the territory was illegal  that Morocco operated a police State and that the world Organization had failed to protect the basic human rights of the Saharans.  Although the conflict was easy to solve  leading countries in the Security Council were backing Morocco despite the obvious violations occurring in Western Sahara.  She believed the only solution to the conflict was to allow the Saharan people to exercise their rights through a free  fair and transparent referendum. GÍSLI KR. BJÖRNSSON  Lagarök  drew attention to Morocco’s reform process  which  in 2011  had seen the adoption of a Constitution through a popular referendum.  An initiative of “advanced regionalization” was outlined in that text  aiming to achieve development in all regions of Morocco  including the Sahara region.  An environmentally sustainable and socially equitable growth model for that area had been proposed  which aimed to diversify local business and economic actors.  Experiences in the Arctic had shown that autonomy was an adequate solution that could both enhance economic development and avoid the dismantling of existing States.  Financial autonomy would be an important step towards consolidating effective management in the region. YAHJABOU ESSALLAMI spoke emotionally of the untimely death of his brother along the border of Mauritania and Algeria.  He pleaded with the United Nations  non-governmental organizations and the entire international community to bring back the rights of the Saharan people in honour of his late brother. LAHCEN MAHRAOUI said that  as a Western Saharan  he was participating in the Committee’s session because the suffering and the conflict had lasted too long.  He hoped to clarify the difference between Frente Polisario as a separatist movement  which claimed to be the sole representative of the Saharan people  and the Western Saharans themselves.  Life for Saharans was not the same as it was in 1975  when many were pastoral or nomadic.  Now  Saharan life was modern  and many had fled the Frente Polisario camps for Morocco in order to lead a “normal” life.  Since 1975  Algeria had not allowed the international community to make a census of the population in the camps  making it impossible to provide adequate aid for the refugees. Statements NABEEL MUNIR (Pakistan)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that the Special Committee on Decolonization remained the primary focal point for a comprehensive  system-wide effort of engaging the international community in pursuing the unfinished decolonization agenda.  He noted that informal consultations with representatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories  as well as the good offices of the Secretary General were highly appreciated.  The sustained and balanced growth of those fragile economies  including increased development assistance  was critical  and innovative approaches were also needed to conclude the long-outstanding work. He said decolonization could only be as effective as Members allowed it to be.  Without political will from both the General Assembly and the Security Council  implementation of recommendations of the Special Committee and its decisions was not possible.  A concerted effort was also required to ensure a uniform implementation of Security Council resolutions  he said  noting that selective implementation eroded the confidence of the international community and undermined the credibility of the United Nations system.  On the unresolved Jammu and Kashmir dispute  Pakistan was willing to engage India in a comprehensive dialogue to find a peaceful resolution that would normalize relations. DIANA E.S. SUTIKNO (Indonesia)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  stressed that self-determination  as an inalienable right  must be applied consistent with the relevant international laws.  She commended the significant progress made by the Decolonization Committee since its establishment in 1961  and in particular  that body’s enhanced cooperation and continuous engagement with the administering Powers in implementing its mandate.  Despite that progress  however  decolonization remained unfinished business.  There was a serious need to work towards expediting the process through good faith and cooperation among all parties concerned.  It was also essential to ensure that the people of the Non-Self-Governing Territories had adequate access to information and education about their political status  to enable them to make an informed decision. AUGUSTO THORNBERRY (Peru)  associating with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Union of South American Nations  said that  although significant progress had been made in decolonization over the decades  the process was incomplete.  As the United Nations advanced on the matter  two fundamental issues needed to come together:  developing necessary political will and recognizing the specific circumstances of each territory.  The Special Committee should be in direct dialogue with the parties concerned to develop specific road maps and to facilitate sustained growth in the Non-Self-Governing Territories.  The case of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)* was special  which the United Nations had acknowledged.  Peru constantly supported the legitimate rights of Argentina’s sovereignty and stressed the importance of a negotiated settlement.  With that  he urged both parties to refrain from unilateral modifications. CHARLES T. NTWAAGAE (Botswana)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  said he wished the issue of decolonization was no longer on the agenda  and reaffirmed his position in support for the right to self-determination for the people of Western Sahara.  Saharans should have the right to choose between independence and integration with Morocco  and be given the opportunity to do so through a referendum.  Welcoming the efforts of the Secretary-General to keep the concerned parties engaged in dialogue  he urged them to approach negotiations with tolerance and mutual respect towards reaching a lasting solution. DER KOGDA (Burkina Faso)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  reiterated his country’s solidarity with Non-Self-Governing Territories around the world who wished to exercise their right to self-determination.  While the United Nations had played an important role in facilitating that process  its work remained unfinished as millions still lived in Non-Self-Governing territories. That issue  he went on  required the collective effort and will of the international community.  He drew attention to Western Sahara  where  despite numerous initiatives  the international community had reached an impasse.  He praised the Secretary-General and the Special Envoy for their efforts to revitalize the negotiations  while voicing support for Morocco’s proposal  which provided a credible resolution. KODJO MENAN (Togo) regretted that  despite years of effort  a settlement of the Western Sahara question remained elusive.  All parties needed to transcend their maximalist positions and strike a compromise.  Morocco’s proposal to grant autonomy to Western Sahara represented a fair balance between the expectations of both parties.  Ending the conflict was critical to meeting the aspirations of the Saharan people and boosting peace  security and stability in the region.  The dispute should be of major concern to the international community  he said  stressing the need for improved relations between Morocco and Algeria. SONIA SUGHAYAR (Jordan) said that maintaining a colonial situation was incompatible with the United Nations Charter.  Peoples under colonization and foreign occupation had the right to determine their future and sovereignty over their lands and resources.  They also had the right to ensure that their political  economic and social interests were protected.  It was  therefore  of great importance to reach a peaceful  just and lasting solution to all colonial and occupied territories to improve the future status of their peoples. Dispatching United Nations visiting missions to Non-Self-Governing Territories was important and should be increased  she said.  Those were an effective means to assess the real situation and assist in achieving the peoples’ aspirations.  She welcomed positive developments with regard to Tokelau  Saint Helena  New Caledonia and the Cayman Islands  but said she would be remiss if she did not highlight the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the establishment of their independent  sovereign and viable State  on the basis of the pre-1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.  She urged the international community and the United Nations to work towards ending the occupation by Israel and called on the parties to resume negotiations on all final status issues  particularly Jerusalem  refugees  borders and security. ANATOLIO NDONG MBA (Equatorial Guinea)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said dialogue was central to ensuring peace  security and sustainable development.  The question of Western Sahara had witnessed the basis for a settlement and the momentum needed to be stepped up for a durable and successful resolution.  The parties should support  in a decisive and pragmatic manner  the United Nations’ efforts and contribute to the economic development and human rights of the region.  He welcomed the initiatives taken by Morocco  and called on the Decolonization Committee to approve all resolutions by consensus  thereby underscoring the international community’s resolve. ANTHONY BOSAH (Nigeria) recalled that 53 years after the adoption of resolution 1514 (XV)  17 territories were still under the yoke of colonialism.  Nigeria believed in the right of people to realize their political  economic and socio-cultural aspirations  and viewed colonialism in any form as a negation of human values.  He urged negotiations to resume for a peaceful solution to the dispute in the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)  and called for the exploration of all options to implement self-determination in all colonized territories or under the domination of administering Powers.  Regarding Western Sahara  a referendum on self-determination for the Saharan people was one the most pressing task of the United Nations.  He urged Morocco to continue negotiations to achieve a settlement. OSCAR LEÓN GONZALEZ (Cuba)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  said that colonialism remained an outstanding issue on the international agenda.  As long as people around the world lived under those conditions  the United Nations work in that area would remain incomplete. He reaffirmed the inalienable right of the Puerto Rican people for self-determination and expressed the Community’s commitment to work within international law to achieve a situation whereby Latin America was free of colonialism.  He called on the United States to “shoulder its responsibility” to further that process  with the aim of making Puerto Rico a sovereign country.  The Puerto Rican people  he asserted  were not free — they remained under domination.  He pointed out that the Non-Aligned Movement  which represented the majority of the United Nations membership  supported the independence of Puerto Rico. Cuba also supported Argentina and its claims to the Malvinas Islands (Falklands)  which he said  were an “inseparable part” of that country.  He urged an end to that dispute in line with the relevant Security Council resolution  which called on both parties to not make any unilateral decisions that would alter the situation as they worked through the process recommended by the General Assembly.  Any action designed to militarize the South Atlantic would escalate the conflict and create tensions that could derail the peace process  he warned. MICHAEL TATHAM (United Kingdom) said that his country’s relations with its Overseas Territories were based on partnership  shared values and self-determination  which brought mutual benefits and responsibilities.  The United Kingdom had been working closely with the Territories to achieve the objectives of a “white paper” issued in 2012.  He urged all countries to respect the wishes of the people of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)  who voted overwhelmingly in favour of remaining with the United Kingdom. He said any decision to break the constitutional link that the United Kingdom shared with its Overseas Territories should be made on the basis of the people’s wishes.  The United Nations should de-list Territories where such decisions had been made.  The white paper also sought to strengthen good governance and the welfare of the people  in accordance with the United Nations Charter  he said  adding that the Territorial Governments were expected to maintain the United Kingdom’s high standards of governance  human rights and accountability.  The United Kingdom looked forward to upcoming elections in some of its Overseas Territories and would respect the wishes of others who sought self-determination. On Gibraltar  he said the United Kingdom would not enter into sovereignty negotiations with anyone against the wishes of the people of Gibraltar. Right of Reply The representative of India  speaking in exercise of the right of reply  said he regretted that Pakistan had brought up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir and rejected it as irrelevant to the work of the Committee.  The people of Jammu and Kashmir had peacefully chosen their destiny in accordance with internationally recognized practices.  He quoted the Indian Prime Minister’s address to the General Assembly last month wherein he had expressed a readiness for serious bilateral dialogue with Pakistan in peace and outside the shadow of terrorism.  Pakistan must take its responsibility in the regard seriously  and raising irrelevant issues would not help. The representative of the United Kingdom  responding to statements by the representatives of Peru and Cuba  said his Government had no doubts about the sovereignty of its Overseas Territories. The Falkland Islands (Malvinas) had no indigenous people and no one was evicted  he said.  Claims of militarization were false and the United Kingdom had been maintaining a reduced defensive posture.  The United Kingdom remained fully committed to defend the rights of the people of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)  he said  adding that the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands would remain Overseas Territories. Also speaking in exercise of the right of reply  the representative of Pakistan said his reference to Jammu and Kashmir was entirely relevant to the Committee’s work.  The Decolonization Declaration stated that all subjugated people had the right to self-determination  and the people of Jammu and Kashmir had been denied that right for 60 years.  Jammu and Kashmir was never an integral part of India and the United Nations asserted that its final disposition would be made through a plebiscite under United Nations’ auspices.  No election by India could substitute for a free and fair United Nations plebiscite.  Pakistan condemned terrorism and took a leading in fighting against it  he said  stressing that the rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir could not be subsumed under the label of terrorism. The representative of Morocco  responding to assertions that his country was behind the impasse in Western Sahara  said the issue of a referendum had been overtaken by the imperative of a political settlement.  While Morocco’s initiative for autonomy was deemed serious and credible by the international community  other parties remained set on their original positions.  So  who was responsible for the impasse? On the question of exploitation of natural resources  he said Morocco was intent on developing Western Sahara  which took into account the social and economic needs of the local population by harnessing resources there.  No recognized international body had called Morocco’s exploration of natural resources illegal.  On human rights  he said Morocco cooperated with international human rights organizations in a clear and transparent way  and its record was recognized internationally. The representative of Spain reiterated his full support for the United Nations doctrine of self-determination  but added that the solution to Gibraltar was through dialogue between Spain and the United Kingdom  taking into account the legitimate interests of the people.  The tensions to which the United Kingdom’s delegate referred were an outcome of actions of local and British Governments.  Spain had attempted to make inspections in its waters in the least restrictive manner.  It believed there were prospects for the future  he said  citing a meeting in Madrid today.  A consensual decision could be within reach  he added. The representative of Argentina  responding to the United Kingdom  said the Malvinas Islands (Falklands)  South Georgia and Sandwich Islands were within Argentine sovereignty and were illegally occupied by United Kingdom.  That was a sovereignty dispute  recognized by United Nations’ resolutions.  The United Kingdom Government was obfuscating the events surrounding the 1983 conflict  which Argentina deemed an invasion.  The dispute over sovereignty was outside the purview of the right to self-determination principle.  The referendum in the Malvinas Islands (Falklands) was a unilateral exercise that was not recognized by international organizations  and the United Kingdom’s military presence in the region was a continuation of its imperialist policies.  Argentina and other Governments rejected the white paper. Taking the floor a second time  the representative of India described Pakistan’s position on Jammu and Kashmir as “untenable”. The representative of Pakistan responded  in right of reply  by stressing that attacking an argument did not undermine its legality. The representative of the United Kingdom  also taking the floor a second time  said that in the interest of time  he would reiterate his earlier interventions on Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)  and stressed that his Government had not confusion regarding the sovereignty of its Overseas Territories. The representative of Argentina said the referendum in the Malvinas Islands (Falklands) was not recognized by the international community and did not impact the sovereignty dispute between his country and the United Kingdom. The representative of Spain again insisted that the United Kingdom should engage in negotiations with his country on resolving the dispute  in keeping with legitimate interests of the people of Gibraltar. * A dispute exists between the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (Malvinas). Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-10,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gadis3500.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The difficult and complex conventional arms control challenge  which delegates hoped would be mitigated with the coming entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty  dominated debate in the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) today. As discussion continued  Guatemala’s representative said reigning in the defensive power and provocative trigger of conventional weapons flows was the ‘weakest link’ in arms control efforts.  No country could take on that challenge by itself  let alone a small developing country.  She expressed hope that the Arms Trade Treaty would help thwart those weapons’ diversion into the illicit market.   The representative of the United Republic of Tanzania urged the international community to not just “pay lip service” to staunching the recurring problem of illicit flows of small arms and light weapons  to which his country was a victim.  Botswana’s representative said the country had acquired marking machines  and  to date  had marked all weapons in the Government’s arsenal  except those held by the military.  The process of marking weapons in civilian possession  he added  would begin in the near future. Representatives from the African continent were no less concerned about nuclear weapons.  Zambia  said its speaker  joined other “peace custodians” in calling on nuclear-armed States to scale back their investment in those weapons  and discouraged others from joining the arms race.  There were “no winners in nuclear warfare ” he stated. Nuclear weapons “should be abolished before they abolish the world’s community ” said the representative of the Philippines.  While “skewed security perceptions and reliance on the comfort of deterrence” slowed progress in nuclear disarmament  he believed the legal  humanitarian  and moral frameworks for total disarmament would remain the international community’s compass towards that goal. Similarly  the representative of the Maldives said some countries considered those weapons to be a symbol of pride.  No nation on Earth had the ability to deal with their repercussions.  Their use — which  in worst case scenarios  could annihilate entire countries — could not only cause the gravest humanitarian emergency  but would also have catastrophic global ramifications on the environment  climate  health  social order  and human development. As this year marked the seventieth anniversary of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki  Japan’s representative said it was crucial for all States to urgently fulfil their disarmament commitments  and work to ensure that nuclear weapons were not used or proliferated. Also speaking were the representatives of the Netherlands  Brazil  Kazakhstan  Thailand  Benin  Uruguay  Syria  Ukraine  Cambodia and Bangladesh. The representatives of Turkey  Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  and Japan spoke in exercise of the right of reply. The Committee will meet again at 3 p.m. on Monday  13 October to continue its general debate. Background The First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) met this morning to continue its general debate.  For background  see Press Release GA/DIS/3497. Statements HENK COR VAN DER KWAST (Netherlands)  associating himself with the European Union  said that his country was fully committed to the goal of a world without nuclear weapons.  In that context  it would continue to promote the full implementation of the 2010 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) Action Plan  a common road map towards the 2015 Review Conference.  He further expressed concern that the implementation of the actions under the Treaty’s nuclear disarmament pillar were lagging behind.  He rejected the notion that the “international strategic situation” was a reason to thwart nuclear disarmament efforts  as claimed by some in the international community. He said that the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons detonation  tabled for the Vienna Conference in December this year  underpinned all efforts to advance nuclear disarmament.  The international community  however  could not ignore the security dimension of that discussion.  In that regard  the Netherlands hoped that the Vienna Conference would contribute to a successful outcome of the NPT Review Conference.  As a fissile material cut-off treaty remained a top priority for the country  it welcomed the two positive meetings of the Group of Governmental Experts on the matter; it hoped its work would contribute to the early start of negotiations on the fissile material ban. The Nuclear Security Summit  hosted by the Netherlands in March  he said  had produced “substantial results” in reducing the amount of civil nuclear material globally  which improved its security and enhanced international cooperation.  Nevertheless  the task remained of further strengthening the security of all civil and military nuclear material  while creating a robust nuclear security architecture for years to come.  On the subject of small arms and light weapons  he said that  while the Fifth Biennial Meetings of States on the 2001 Programme of Action had been a success  sight should not be lost of the continued importance of the Programme’s implementation.  Much more work was needed  however  in tracing and tracking. ANTONIO DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil)  associating himself with the New Agenda Coalition and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  said the implementation of the NPT suffered from a fundamental imbalance.  While the international community had fared well with regard to its non-proliferation objectives  the same could not be said about disarmament commitments.  The “compliance deficit” by the nuclear-weapon States harmed the integrity of the NPT regime  and jeopardized the success achieved in non-proliferation.  In order to have a successful 2015 Review Conference  unequivocal and concrete commitments by the nuclear-armed States to advance nuclear disarmament were needed. Beyond the fears instilled by the possibility of a detonation  the mere existence of nuclear weapons affected people’s lives  he said.  The severe financial resources diverted to the maintenance and modernization of nuclear arsenals could  if invested elsewhere  provide significant betterment of living conditions worldwide.  Even amid the global financial crisis  it was estimated that the nuclear-weapon States spent around $100 billion a year to maintain their arsenals. The NPT Review Conference next year would be an opportunity to consider the components of a concrete road map to nuclear disarmament and its timeframe for implementation.  Nuclear disarmament must remain a global priority  reflected in decisive steps and the urgent launch of negotiations. BARLYBAI SADYKOV (Kazakhstan) affirmed that nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation were the main priorities of his country’s foreign policy agenda.  Having closed down one the largest nuclear-test sites in the world  his country was taking practical measures to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.  As such  he expressed concerned that  while non-nuclear-weapon States were fulfilling their NPT commitments  nuclear-weapon States were not.  Kazakhstan fully supported the proposal to start negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on drafting a comprehensive nuclear weapons convention.  To further that goal  Kazakhstan proposed the adoption of a United Nations declaration on the achievement of a world free of nuclear weapons  and would continue consultations on a draft resolution. This year  he noted  Kazakhstan had hosted the twenty-first World Congress of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War.  It had also launched the “ATOM” (Abolish Testing Our Mission) project to inform the world community about the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons tests.  As a country that had experienced the “disastrous consequences” of nuclear explosions  it fully supported multilateral discussions on this issue  and hoped they would lead to a total ban on testing and the elimination of those weapons. He described the signing of the Protocol to the Semipalatinsk Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia as the most important event in the area of non-proliferation this year.  The zone’s establishment  which was the result of the collective efforts of all five Central Asian States  would contribute to the implementation of the NPT and strengthen both regional and global security.  In its capacity as “Chair of the Treaty”  Kazakhstan would table a draft resolution for consideration by the First Committee.   He encouraged its adoption by consensus. NORACHIT SINHASENI (Thailand)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  said that arms and armed conflicts remained the largest obstacle to global peace and security  while also hindering economic and social development.  He welcomed the positive momentum created by the international conference on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons  and hoped such conferences would result in a serious discussion leading to concrete outcomes.  Nuclear-weapon-free zones were concrete confidence-building measures  and making progress towards such a zone in the Middle East would help preserve the credibility of the NPT. He said that last month  Thailand had joined Cuba and Mexico in co-hosting a Bangkok event to observe the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons.  There  a youth participant noted that a world without nuclear weapons was like a neighbourhood where fear did not thrive or control people’s actions.  Thailand was mindful of the enormous benefits of nuclear energy and technology; however  the use of nuclear energy needed to be accompanied by adequate technical know-how and safeguards.  Troubled by the continued proliferation of small arms and light weapons  he noted the imminent entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty  and hoped Thailand would become a State party to that treaty very soon. Inter-agency consultations had been convened to review and assess its existing framework and regulations. JEAN-FRANCIS RÉGIS ZINSOU (Benin)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and African Group  said that this First Committee session gave Member States the opportunity to reflect on the ways and means to achieve a world free of the threat of nuclear and conventional weapons. Benin reiterated calls for the total destruction of nuclear weapons and the reduction of small arms and light weapons  which  he said  had ultimately become weapons of mass destruction. He called for the nuclear Powers to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons  and urged the international community to remain vigilant in not returning to the doctrine of the cold war. At the same time  he praised the bilateral discussions between the United States and the Russian Federation on limiting their stockpiles. The “zero option” should be supported by greater efforts at the multilateral level to conceptually define the principles that would bind all  he said. He called on the international community to reinvigorate the disarmament machinery to help control weapons and military spending  highlighting the important role of the Conference of Disarmament. At the same time  Benin was troubled by the difficulties facing the United Nations Disarmament Commission  which had not made sufficient progress on its agenda items in years. He hoped the upcoming session would make tangible progress. He urged the international community to not fall victim to the “self-imposed rule of consensus”. He acknowledged the mobilisation of non-governmental organizations and civilians who had been in the “vanguard on the struggle of nuclear disarmament”. He expressed support for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Middle East  and urged that a conference be held to help make that goal a reality. Recalling Security Council resolution 1540 (2004)  he reaffirmed Benin’s commitment to preventing the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by terrorists. Efforts must be specifically stepped up when dealing with the scourge of those weapons in the hands of religious groups. To that end  he commended the Arms Trade Treaty as a major achievement by the United Nations towards “the greater good of humanity”. The ease with which groups could acquire those weapons to launch “asymmetric wars” against States required the Treaty’s steady implementation  he warned. GONZALO KONCKE (Uruguay)  associating with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States   expressed his county’s strong commitment to fighting the trafficking of small arms and light weapons  which were truly weapons of mass destruction in the.  Such weapons threatened civilians  particularly women and children  he said  describing the Arms Trade Treaty as an important step towards global regulation and more responsible trade in those weapons  their parts  and munitions.  Regulating that trade would have key consequences for armed conflicts  especially as that would help protect civilian victims.  The key objective of the Arms Trade Treaty was to save lives  and  to do that  the international community must join forces and protect attacks against civilians. At the national level  he said  Uruguay was updating its legislation to bring it in line with the Arms Trade Treaty  which was an international benchmark for combatting illicit weapons trafficking.  As a non-nuclear-weapon State  Uruguay was committed to strengthening the disarmament and non-proliferation regime.  The humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons should spur their prohibition  and he also urged the prompt entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).  Pending that  he urged all States to maintain their moratoriums on nuclear testing; also  the Conference on Disarmament to begin negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty  as well as to take steps to create a zone free of nuclear and other mass destruction weapons in the Middle East.  One way to improve the work of the Conference on Disarmament would be to expand its membership to States that had expressed an interest  such as Uruguay. BASHAR JA’AFARI (Syria) expressed support for a world free from the use of force and in line with the United Nations Charter  based on peace between peoples.  Syria was ready to contribute to all genuine international efforts to achieve those goals.  Four decades after the conclusion of the NPT  it was necessary for the nuclear-weapon States to comply with its article VI  and put an end to Israel’s non-accession.  He stressed the inalienable right of NPT States parties to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.  Also important was for the Conference on Disarmament to adopt a comprehensive and balanced programme of work  which would include subsidiary organs on the total elimination of nuclear weapons  and the granting of negative security assurances for non-nuclear-armed States. He said that the illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons destabilized States and contributed to terrorism.  The instability in Syria would not have occurred without the training and supplies given to those groups  both from the Arab region and elsewhere in the world.  One of Syria’s major concerns about the Arms Trade Treaty was the opposition to the inclusion of a clear call to categorically prohibit the export of weapons to non-State actors and terrorists  he said  adding that current events in Syria and elsewhere substantiated those concerns.  Such weapons were reaching terrorist groups  which eroded stability and regional security  as had been seen in the separation zone of the Syrian Golan.  He firmly condemned the use of nuclear weapons as an ”odious crime”  and called for the perpetrators to be held accountable.  The use of weapons of mass destruction  including nuclear weapons  was reprehensible and immoral  he added. Countries that supported terrorism in Syria continued to level unfounded accusations against the Syrian Government  he said.  Turkey and Saudi Arabia had been directly involved with supplying terrorist groups with chemical weapons and other “weapons of death” in Syria.  Turkey trained criminal elements in its own territory before sending them to Syria.  It would have been better to offer aid to Syria; instead  Turkey drew its religious ideology from terrorist groups and had transformed into the main support base for them. He called on States to rid the Middle East region of all nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. That  however  could not be done until Israel subjected its nuclear facilities to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections.  All double standards should be banished  he urged. IRENE SUSAN BARREIRO NATIVIDAD (Philippines)  associating with ASEAN and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that the continued existence of nuclear weapons remained a global issue of concern.  Against a landscape of major conflicts  insecurity and mistrust  the danger posed by those weapons was alarming.  Slow progress in reducing and — ultimately — eliminating them  stemmed from “skewed security perceptions and reliance on the comfort of deterrence”.  For its part  the Philippines had always pushed for dialogue as the only way to wean States away from that trend. She lent her country’s strong support to the ongoing humanitarian discourse on the “catastrophic effects” of nuclear weapons.  Discussions in that area were productive  not only in providing facts about the devastation of those weapons to humanity and the environment  but in helping establishing a legal framework towards their complete elimination.  The legal  humanitarian  and moral frameworks for total disarmament would remain the international community’s “compass” towards a nuclear-weapon free world. In the area of conventional weapons  she said that reconciliation in the Southern Philippines would not have been possible  had it not been for the commitment of both the Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front to engage in “normalization” activities  with a programme for decommissioning weapons.  For too long  the presence of tens of thousands of firearms had posed a serious challenge to the peace process in her country.  As a result  the Philippines was supportive of the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action to prevent  combat  and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. NKOLOI NKOLOI (Botswana)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said his delegation remained deeply concerned over the illicit transfer  manufacture  and circulation of small arms and light weapons.  Their accumulation and uncontrolled spread in all regions of the world was a cause for serious concern; those arms remained the weapons of choice in most conflict situations  with lasting consequences on the innocent.  It was against that background that Botswana remained committed to the fight against trafficking in small arms and light weapons  and the United Nations Programme of Action.  To implement that plan  tracing and record-keeping were indispensable. In line with the provisions of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol  the above Programme of Action and the International Tracing Instrument  Botswana  he said  had acquired marking machines with the assistance of the American State Department on Politics and Military Affairs.  To date  his country had marked all arms in the Government’s possession  except for those held by the military  and an exercise to mark those in civilian possession would commence in the near future. YURIY SERGEYEV (Ukraine) said that the use of nuclear weapons was the most serious threat facing humankind today.  It was essential to strengthen international cooperation in order to reinforce the global disarmament and non-proliferation regime.  Pursuing that goal  Ukraine had abandoned its nuclear-weapon capability  and acceded to the NPT in November 1994.  It had also taken concrete steps in eliminating the use of highly enriched uranium for civilian purposes  by removing existing stocks from the national territory in March 2012. Ukraine’s decision to renounce nuclear weapons  he went on  had taken place against the background of the Russian Federation’s aggression  occupation  and annexation of his country’s territory in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea  and destabilization in the south-eastern regions of Ukraine.  He was especially cynical of those actions by the Russian Federation because that country was a State-guarantor of Ukraine accession to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon State  signed in Budapest in December 1994.  Additionally  under article V of the 1997 Partition Treaty on the Status and Conditions of the Black Sea Fleet  the Russian Federation was obliged to not have nuclear weapons stationed in Ukraine’s territory.  That country’s unilateral action to denounce that agreement this year was disturbing. Stressing the importance of the CTBT  negative security assurances  and commencement of negotiations for a fissile material cut-off treaty  he said that Ukraine had signed the Arms Trade Treaty on 23 September and welcomed its upcoming entry into force in December. MÓNICA BOLAÑOS PÉREZ (Guatemala)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that  while her country had no first-hand experience with nuclear weapons  it has been greatly affected by small arms and light weapons; those had contributed to armed violence and insecurity  and exacerbated gender-based crime.  Their trafficking remained one of Guatemala’s top priorities  as that stunted its development capacity.  No country could take on that enormous challenge  let alone a small  developing country.  As a cross-cutting matter that affected all  a multilateral framework was required to help States protect their civilians from those dangerous weapons.  To that end  Guatemala welcomed the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty  the first legally binding instrument of its kind  at the global level.  That initiative would help address the “weakest link” in the weapons chain  and help thwart their diversion into the illicit market.  Guatemala had signed the Treaty  and was beginning the process of ratification. She went on to note that her country was part of a region that had shown leadership in that area  and she welcomed Mexico for hosting the First Conference of State Parties.  She encouraged implementation of the 2001 Programme of Action and its follow-up mechanism.  At the same time  she noted the lack of progress made at the Fifth Meeting of States to the Convention on Cluster Munitions  adding that any global discussion on weapons was incomplete without addressing that growing problem.  Her country was proud that Latin America and the Caribbean region had established the world’s first cluster-munition-free zone. On the NPT  she said it was not designed to be a “standing regime”.  Non-nuclear-armed states had “fulfilled their part of the bargain”; now it was up to the nuclear-weapon States to do the same  she said  adding that the international community must actively work together to ensure nuclear disarmament.  Guatemala believed that the establishment of nuclear-weapon–free zones was essential and hoped that the zone in the Latin American and Caribbean region served as a model for others.  Her country also supported efforts to bring the Middle East closer to that goal.  Guatemala called for universal ratification by all States of the CTBT  and  pending the Treaty’s entry into force  urged a moratorium on nuclear testing. MWABA PATRICIA KASESE-BOTA (Zambia)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and African Group  expressed concern about the “catastrophic” humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons  noting that the testing and manufacturing of those weapons had created unacceptable outcomes  and undermined progress in global development.  “Refined approaches” were needed in this session to seize the opportunity for a common  global treaty that banned those weapons.  Their production  deployment  and stockpiling  should be rejected by all Member States for the betterment of future generations.  In that regard  Zambia had joined other global “peace custodians” in calling upon nuclear-States to scale back their investment in nuclear weapons  and discouraged others from joining the nuclear arms race. Despite conferences on nuclear disarmament held in Oslo and Mexico  little progress had been made  she said. However  the First Committee session offered a “new window” of concerted efforts towards the third nuclear disarmament conference to be held in Vienna later this year.  There were “no winners in nuclear warfare”  she said  adding that Member States must work together towards a nuclear-weapon-free world.  Concerning other weapons of mass destruction  Zambia echoed the condemnation by the African Group on the recent use of chemical weapons  which had led to the loss of life of innocent women and children.  It encouraged States that had not yet ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention to do so. Praising the upcoming entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty  she said that instrument brought hope of drastically reducing and controlling the proliferation of illegal firearms. The Committee’s deliberations this session must synchronize with the renewed international commitment to enforce the treaty.    RY TUY (Cambodia)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and ASEAN  said that the presence of landmines and explosive remnants of war still posed constant threats to human security  and national development.  The Mine Ban Treaty addressed the human tragedy and suffering of victims in Cambodia and other similar regions  such as Mozambique  Angola  Afghanistan  and Bosnia-Herzegovina  where the commitment to put an end to those inhumane and deadly weapons had been born. Joining the international community in its concerns over the continued loss of human life from armed conflicts  Cambodia  he noted  had signed the Arms Trade Treaty.  It aimed to regulate the trade of conventional weapons  and provide the impetus for effective monitoring and stabilizing of their flows  particularly in conflict-prone regions.  One could not overlook the fact that small arms and light weapons still claimed civilian and military lives  and posed a threat to human security — especially in warring and post-war countries.  While the world was still challenged by armed conflicts and a fear of weapons proliferation by illegal means  it was more important than ever to make collective efforts to address the issues through further commitments by  and cooperation among all States. EDWARD VICTOR MASALLA (United Republic of Tanzania)  associating with the African Group and Non-Aligned Movement  warned that the consequences of a nuclear weapon detonation would be catastrophic; it had the potential to spread across borders and bring irreparable harm to the natural ecosystem  destroying it for generations to come.  A legal instrument prohibiting such usage would strengthen the NPT  by fulfilling its disarmament and non-proliferation objectives.  His country was a party to several legally binding disarmament and arms control instruments  including the NPT; CTBT; Arms Trade Treaty; Convention on Cluster Munitions; and the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (Pelindaba Treaty). It also supported the Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons.  As a signatory of the Pelindaba Treaty since 1996  the United Republic of Tanzania supported the establishment of such zones worldwide  as those were an “invaluable contribution” to the maintenance of international peace and security.  The country had also lent its support for the establishment of a nuclear-weapons-free zone in the Middle East.  In the same vein  it called on all nuclear-armed States to ratify international treaties and protocols related to those zones. Turning to weapons of mass destruction  he said his country supported their complete elimination  in all their forms.  His country believed in protecting the “sanctity of human life  wherever people live and in whatever conditions they are in”.  While his country and subregion did not produce nuclear weapons  it was a recurring victim of illicit arms and light weapons.  He urged the international community to not continue to “pay lip service to that anathema ” and to do away with those weapons.  For all  he said  the common purpose was to pursue global development  peace  and security.  But that was only possible in a world free from the fear and terror that came with the possibility of nuclear detonations.  With that in mind  he warned that nuclear weapons “should be abolished before they abolish the world’s community”. AHMED SAREER (Maldives) said his country did not produce any weapons or armaments of any kind  and had no ambitions to do so.  While the Maldives might not have the resources to contribute towards strengthening and enforcing the global non-proliferation and disarmament regime  it was still aware of the threat to all countries posed by weapons of mass destruction.  No nation on earth had the ability to deal with the repercussions of nuclear weapons  even though some countries considered those weapons to be a symbol of pride. The use of nuclear weapons not only caused the gravest humanitarian emergencies  he said  but also had catastrophic  global ramifications on the environment  climate  health  social order  and human development.  In worst-case scenarios  the use of those weapons could lead to the annihilation of an entire country.  He welcomed the increased attention paid to the humanitarian consequences of those weapons  as well as the International Day for their total elimination.  He further welcomed the coming entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty  and said the Maldives was in the process of acceding to it. ABULKALAM ABDUL MOMEN (Bangladesh)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that  when talking about nuclear disarmament  “the first word that comes to mind is disappointment”  adding that  perhaps no other goal of the United Nations remained so painfully underachieved.  The rhetoric on nuclear disarmament had not matched up to a concrete and tangible achievement; mankind was still confronted with an “unprecedented threat of self-extinction”  arising from the accumulation of nuclear weapons.  As a result  many were now worried about the safety and security of nuclear arsenals. Bangladesh’s position had been “consistent  straight-forward  and unambiguous” on this issue  he said.  Convinced that nuclear weapons could not guarantee security or peace  his country had unequivocally reaffirmed its commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons.  Nuclear technology’s only purpose was in its peaceful use  under comprehensive IAEA safeguards.  In that regard  the country had been working with the Agency on civil and peaceful use of nuclear technology  particularly in the agriculture and energy sectors. On the other hand  some continued to possess those weapons to guarantee their security  he said.  Valuable resources that could provide decent lives to the deprived  were  instead  being used to create more sophisticated weapons.  Addressing the nuclear-armed States  he asked them to think about the more than $105 billion spent annually on building new nuclear arsenals  and the $50 billion per annum it would take to halve poverty for the 5 billion people of the world. TOSHIO SANO (Japan) stressed the importance of realistic and practical steps towards nuclear disarmament  in order to avoid “political instability and military imbalance”.  Together with other members of the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative  Japan had actively worked to strengthen the NPT regime. It had proposed to work towards “three reductions” — in the number of nuclear weapons  the role they played  and the incentive to possess them.  It had also proposed “three preventions” — the emergence of new nuclear-weapon States  the proliferation of nuclear-weapons-related material  and nuclear terrorism.  Japan sought to move towards a world without nuclear weapons with that concept in mind. As this year marked the seventieth anniversary of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki  it was crucial for all States to urgently fulfil their disarmament commitments; also  to work to ensure that nuclear weapons were not used or proliferated.  Their elimination was possible through substantive and constructive engagement with States that possessed them.  In that respect  Japan would once again submit a resolution on “United action towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons”. He went on to condemn the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear and missile development programmes — including its work in uranium enrichment — describing it as a “serious threat to the peace and stability of the region and the entire international community”.  In particular  Japan was strongly concerned over that country’s repeated ballistic missile launches  which were in violation of several Security Council resolutions  and urged it to refrain from any further “provocative action”.  A nuclear test by that country was unacceptable  as it seriously undermined the international non-proliferation regime  and risked reversing efforts towards a world free of nuclear weapons. Rights of Reply Speaking in exercise of the right of reply  the representative of Turkey said his delegation categorically denied the baseless allegations made by another delegation in the room.  The Committee had  once again  observed attempts to divert attention from the human suffering caused by the Syrian regime.  Turkey had not only been a safe refuge for over 1 million civilians fleeing Syria  but had also ensured that humanitarian assistance reached people on the Syrian side of the border.  Turkey would never regret the humanitarian assistance it had provided to desperate Syrians. Also speaking in exercise of the right to reply  the representative of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea said the Japanese delegation had made a fuss about his country’s nuclear deterrence.  However  he wished to issue a reminder that it was the Japanese Government that had allotted $250 million from its 2014 defence budget for the latest intercept missiles  and had purchased stealth fighters  patrol planes  and helicopters.  Assertions made about the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea were a crafty attempt to justify Japan’s own re-invasion scheme.  Japan had increased military spending by 2.8 per cent since last year  in order to stage overseas aggressions.  Most of that expenditure was allocated for advanced missiles that were essential for pre-emptive attacks on other countries.  Japan intended to hold command of the sea and air around the Korean peninsula  in case of an emergency. The current Japanese Government was an extreme rightist one  he said.  Japan was getting further militarized  and was bolstering its navy forces to contain neighbouring countries in the region.  That re-invasion scheme brought the dark clouds of war over Southeast Asia.  Such moves could never be allowed  he said. Responding to that intervention  the representative of Japan said he did not wish to “play catch ball” with his “young and promising colleague” from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as an annual event  as that was not productive.  However  with regard to armaments in Japan  he said his country maintained a defence-oriented policy  and did not pose a threat to other countries; it was a peace-loving nation  he added. Speaking in exercise of a second right of reply  the representative of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea said he did not feel the need to reply to the “old fashion” arguments made against his country.  Such remarks were provocative  and all were aware that Japan was rebuilding its military power in the Northeast Asia region.  He did not know for what purpose  but that rebuilding was visible to the entire world.  The theories put forth by Japan against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea were old-fashioned  and he did not feel the need to reply  except to say that it was a “nonsense” argument and he rejected it. Also taking the floor for a second time in exercise of the right of reply was the representative from Japan  who said he would not repeat his position.  He asked the delegate from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to refer to the homepage of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-10,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gashc4100.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Human trafficking and illicit drugs were jeopardizing peace and social order by ravaging communities  spilling over borders and violating the human rights of its victims worldwide  delegates told the Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) as it concluded a two-day discussion on crime prevention  criminal justice and international drug control. With international instruments in place to combat those scourges  States must effectively use those tools to protect their citizens from cross-border crimes  many speakers said.  Painting a bleak picture of drug addiction as a major national challenge  Afghanistan’s representative pointed out that transnational organized crime  terrorism  narcotics and corruption had undermined development  stability  governance and the rule of law in his country  posing serious threats to society.  Drug dependency  particularly among the most vulnerable populations  he said  remained a grave concern and drug use was rising nationwide.  Suggesting that joint efforts be intensified to tackle those problems  he called upon the international community to further strengthen existing initiatives. Some delegates told similar stories of waves of cross-border crimes jeopardizing the well-being of their citizens and leaving thousands of victims in their wake.  A representative of Lao People’s Democratic Republic said his country was the origin  transit point and destination of human traffickers.  In addition  the illicit drug trade and abuse had deeply affected socio-economic development  poverty eradication and the future of young people  he lamented. Among the greatest crimes facing the international community  human trafficking had touched the lives of tens of thousands of women  men  children and their families every year  some speakers said.  A delegate from the Philippines said transnational crime  corruption  illegal trade and trafficking were great concerns for her Government as citizens had become  due to their worldwide presence  victims and unwitting accomplices of perpetrators of crime. In response to human trafficking  some delegates called for the full implementation of relevant plans of action  including developing adequate capacity-building technical assistance for law enforcement and judicial systems.  Echoing a common thread that ran through the discussion  Georgia’s representative said that justice system reform was a priority to establish and enhance a functional democracy that upheld principles of transparency  accountability and the rule of law.  For that reason  Georgia had supported strengthening crime prevention and criminal justice mechanisms as well as integrating those concerns into the post-2015 development agenda. Also participating today were speakers representing El Salvador  Uganda  Guatemala  Kyrgyzstan  Indonesia  Maldives  Eritrea  Ukraine  Saudi Arabia and Sudan. The Third Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Monday  13 October to begin its consideration of the advancement of women. Background The Third Committee met this morning to continue its consideration on of crime prevention and criminal justice  and on international drug control.  For background information  see Press Release GA/SHC/4099 of 09 October. Statements RUBÉN IGNACIO ZAMORA RIVAS (El Salvador) said a national policy against human trafficking had been agreed upon and now provided a legal framework.  Border immigration agents had been trained to detect trafficking victims  he added  while a network of traffickers operating in the capital had been recently dismantled and a safe space set up for girls and women who were trafficking victims.  Turning to the world drug problem and related criminality  he said that the scope of crime needed systematic and ongoing monitoring.  As those crimes affected development  no unilateral solution was possible.  The General Assembly’s Special Session on the world drug problem scheduled for 2016 was an opportunity to assess what had been done and to agree on next steps.  Success in combating drug trafficking required collective political will  international consensus  increased international cooperation and technical assistance using a sustained approach based on the principle of shared responsibility. RICHARD NDUHUURA (Uganda) said crime prevention was “vital” for the transformation of society and for political  social and economic development.  He welcomed the Secretary-General’s report on the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and Treatment of Offenders (UNAFRI) as well as its review process.  Yet he lamented that a number of challenges were facing the Institute  which was being hosted by his country.  They included a shortage of staff and funds to support substantive programmes  he said  adding that technical assistance was needed for the Institute to fulfil its mandate.  Announcing his delegation’s coordination of a draft resolution on the Institute  he asked Member States for their support. MARÍA SOLEDAD URRUELA ARENALES (Guatemala) said that despite progress and openness in multilateral meetings on the topics at hand  her country had been suffering from drug trafficking  which deeply affected the safety of its citizens.  Emphasizing that current approaches to decrease drug use in Guatemala had failed  she stressed the importance of changing the paradigm to focus on long-lasting solutions.  Yet  in spite of those challenges  Guatemala had shown a capacity to find effective ways to fight the use  trade and production of illicit drugs.  Alongside neighbouring countries  she concluded  Guatemala had also encouraged a global and inclusive debate on drugs in preparation for the 2016 special session.  TAMTA KUPRADZ (Georgia) said justice system reform was a priority for her country.  At the national level  programmes had been implemented to build a system of legal aid services that  among other things  assisted socially disadvantaged citizens.  Reforms were also being pursued to focus on the independence of judges  prosecution services and criminal code.  Concluding  she said Georgia had developed its first stand-alone juvenile justice law  which aimed at fully incorporating the best interests of children. ZAHIR TANIN (Afghanistan) said that transnational organized crime  terrorism  narcotics and corruption had undermined development  stability  governance and the rule of law in his country  posing serious threats to society.  Drug dependency  particularly among the most vulnerable populations  remained a major challenge and drug use was rising across the country.  Emphasizing a need for intensified joint efforts  he reiterated his country’s commitment to the fight against narcotics and illicit trafficking  and called on the international community to further strengthen existing initiatives  such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Networking the Networks  Border Liaison Offices (BLO)  Southern Trafficking Operational Plan (STOP)  Joint Planning Cells (JPC) and the Joint Triangle Cooperation at Northern Trafficking Route (Afghanistan  Kyrgyzstan-Tajikistan). NURAN NIYAZALIEV (Kyrgyzstan) said his country was committed to strengthening regional and international cooperation against transnational crime  given the issue’s global nature.  Human trafficking was also a global phenomenon and efforts needed to be further strengthened to protect the rights of victims.  Turning to corruption  he said his country had developed a special law and national strategy to provide anti-corruption services to eradicate the scourge.  He reiterated Kyrgyzstan’s commitment to dealing with drug-related issues  exemplified in its candidacy for the Commission on Narcotic Drugs.  LIBRAN N. CABACTULAN (Philippines) said transnational crime  corruption  illegal trade and trafficking were concerns for the Government as citizens had become  due to their worldwide presence  victims and unwitting accomplices of perpetrators of crime.  Protecting and assisting citizens had  therefore  become one of the main pillars of foreign policy  she added.  Turning to cybercrime  she noted an increase in the use of information technology to abuse and exploit children.  She urged international cooperation and technical assistance to combat those crimes as well as for trafficking endangered wildlife species.  NONA GAE LUNA (Indonesia) said that her country was committed to combating transnational crime  including illegal economic activities  drug trafficking  money laundering and environmental violations.  The issue of international drug control remained a high priority for her country  she said  adding that it was important to use international cooperation to address the world’s drug problem.  Among preventive measures being taken  for its part  Indonesia had established a multi-stakeholder National Narcotics Board in 2009.  Concluding  she said that the spread of terrorism should be eliminated through the full implementation of the UN Counter-terrorism Strategy.   AHMED SAREER (Maldives) said his country was at risk of becoming a transit State for transnational crimes  such as human and drug trafficking.  As an archipelago of scattered islands at the intersection of several maritime trade routes  Maldives was vulnerable to the pervasive international drug trade.  The country’s law enforcement agencies had regularly coordinated with international partners and inter-agency networks.  The Government had also introduced an anti-piracy bill in Parliament and was building its capacity in that regard.  In closing  he said Maldives was party to the United Nations Convention against Corruption and was currently identifying gaps in its national legislature. AMANUEL GIORGIO (Eritrea) said the crime mostly affecting his country was human trafficking  especially of young people.  To address that issue  the Government had organized awareness-raising campaigns and counselling  and efforts had also been made to dismantle organized crime networks.  In addition  cooperation with neighbouring countries had been forged with the aim of bringing criminals to justice.  To further deal with such crime  he called for coordination and cooperation among origin  transit and destination countries. TARAS KAIUK (Ukraine) expressed concern over the links between organized crime  drugs  money laundering and terrorism  as they posed challenges to the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.  He also commended UNODC for tackling new challenges to the criminal justice system  such as cybercrime.  Human trafficking was one of the greatest crimes facing the international community  he said  calling for the full implementation of relevant plans of action  as well as adequate capacity-building technical assistance for law enforcement and judicial systems. ENASS AL-SHAHWAN (Saudi Arabia) said it was a common responsibility for all actors to combat transnational organized crimes with intensified international cooperation.  She acknowledged the positive role of the United Nations  including the Organization’s funds  programmes and regional commissions  in combatting various types of crimes and providing technical training and assistance.  For its part  her Government had ratified several conventions to prohibit drug trafficking and had taken a number of measures to that end. MAYTHONG THAMMAVONGSA (Lao People’s Democratic Republic) aligning his country with a statement made by Malaysia on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  said that the issue of drugs and crime constituted a significant threat to peace and social order.  Due to its geographical location  his country was the source of origin  transit and also destination for human trafficking and  therefore  national and regional mechanisms had been put in place.  Continuing  he said drug trafficking and abuse had an enormous impact on socio-economic development  poverty eradication and the future of young people.  Further  he linked poverty to insufficient and unsustainable alternative occupations available to the local community.  In conclusion  he reiterated his country’s commitment to working with the international community to address drug problems and transnational crime to ensure sustainable development and improve the well-being and standard of living of its citizens. SHAFAQ ABDALJALEEL JUBARTALLAH MOKWAR (Sudan) called for a unified formula to deal with terrorism that would allow the international community to address it.  She also called for consolidated international assistance to deal with the dangers coming from drugs and crime.  On human trafficking  she said that trilateral and bilateral agreements for border control had been made to impede the passage of criminals.  Turning to drugs  she said that efforts had been made to raise awareness among students on the dangers of drug abuse.  Combating crime needed ongoing support of the international community  she concluded.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-09,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11568.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. In a detailed discussion examining progress in implementing the goals set forth at the landmark 1994 International Conference on Population and Development  delegates today traded views on the place of sexual and reproductive health rights. Societies where women and girls were safe were more prosperous and stable  said the representative of the United States  adding her delegation’s firm support for sexual and reproductive rights for all.  Contraception was not just a matter of convenience  she said  but a matter of life and death.  Family planning could prevent a third of the maternal deaths that occurred each year.  But the representative of the Russian Federation  noting the lack of international consensus on the issue of sexual and reproductive health  said that it was counterproductive to focus on concepts that were not universally supported.  For his part  India’s representative detailed the current political situation surrounding reproductive health care in his country  noting that reproductive care  including abortion  was among 20 comprehensive health services provided free of cost.  Furthermore  on the topic of women’s health and safety  and on combating violence against women  India had made amendments to criminal law which had significantly broadened the definition of sexual assault and harassment to include voyeurism  stalking and other behaviour. Halfway around the world  in New Zealand  a key challenge facing the nation was the persistence of ethnic disparities when it came to reproductive health issues; Maori and Pacific populations were affected disproportionately by negative sexual and reproductive health outcomes  said that country’s representative. For another island nation  Cabo Verde  challenges included the education of a young population and job creation  according the country’s representative.  As a consequence of sound policies and a lower fertility rate  new challenges had been created concerning immigration.  That was starting to pressure the country’s social and economic structures.  But migrants were a resource  argued the representative of the International Organization for Migration  noting that migration was not only inevitable  but also necessary to meet labour demands.  Migration was desirable for migrants and host nations alike. At the start of the meeting  the Assembly adopted by consensus two draft resolutions  submitted by its Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary).  By the terms of the first  the Assembly endorsed the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions that it allow the Secretary-General to enter into commitments of up to $49.9 million for the period from 19 September to 31 December 2014 to fund the newly created United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER). By the second  the Assembly allowed the Comoros  Guinea-Bissau  Sao Tome and Principe  and Somalia to retain their voting rights despite failing to pay their annual contribution to the Organization. Also delivering statements were the representatives of Côte d’Ivoire  Qatar  Argentina  Norway (on behalf of the Nordic countries)  Georgia  Japan  Iran  Indonesia  Papua New Guinea  Ireland  Fiji  Bhutan  Australia  Sudan  Brazil  Colombia  Kyrgyzstan  Morocco  Nigeria  Malta  Eritrea  Malaysia  Philippines  United Kingdom  Madagascar  Cambodia  Zambia  Kiribati  and Maldives  as well as the Holy See and the League of Arab States.  Background Meeting this morning to consider follow-up to the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development  the General Assembly had before it two related reports of the Secretary-General: Framework of action for the follow-up to the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development beyond 2014 (document A/69/62)  and Recurrent themes and key elements identified during the sessions of the Commission on Population and Development (document A/69/122). Action on Drafts At the start of the meeting  the Assembly adopted by consensus two draft resolutions  both submitted by the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary). The first  entitled “United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response”  was contained in the Committee’s report on the Programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015 (document A/69/422).  By its terms  the Assembly took note of the Secretary-General’s report on that subject and endorsed the recommendations set forth by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) in its own report.  The Assembly also stressed that adoption of the text was without prejudice to any subsequent review of the Mission and any decision it might take regarding the Mission’s budgetary arrangements  organizational structure  staffing and operational requirements  when it considered the detailed budget submitted by the Secretary-General. The second draft  on the Scale of assessments for the apportionment of expenses of the United Nations  was contained in the Committee’s eponymous report (document A/69/428).  By its terms  the Assembly agreed that the failure of four countries - the Comoros  Guinea-Bissau  Sao Tome and Principe and Somalia – to pay their respective minimum contributions to the Organization was due to conditions beyond their control and therefore could continue voting in the Assembly until the end of its sixty-ninth session. YOUSSOUFOU BAMBA (Côte d’Ivoire) said a decade of crisis in his country had slowed down progress towards meeting the Cairo goals.  School enrolment had improved from less than 72 per cent in 1998 to 94.7 per cent 2013  and the Government had adopted legislation  effective as of the 2015-2016 school term  making school attendance mandatory starting at age six.  Thanks to steps combatting HIV  the HIV prevalence rate fell to 3.7 per cent in 2012.  Both child and maternal mortality rates had fallen since 1994  the use of modern contraceptives tripled from 1994 to 2012 and family planning was on the rise.  He pointed to national strategies related to development  population  health  the environment  education and youth empowerment.  Cote d‘Ivoire’s population growth rate was among the highest in the world.  The drop out rate for school children remained high  especially for girls.  The effects of climate change  along with soil degradation  had exacerbated food insecurity and public health concerns.  The Government was working to ensure universal health care coverage and to end pregnancy among school-aged girls.  YOUSEF SULTAN LARAM (Qatar) said that there remained gaps in implementation since the holding of the Cairo Conference.  Some challenges and inequalities of a socioeconomic nature were being faced  as many people had been living in poverty throughout the world.  Tireless efforts had been made to implement development objectives  and Qatar had established a national comprehensive strategy on development.  A national vision sought to transform the country into a developed State.  Reiterating that there was no consensus on “controversial” goals involving issues related to sexual orientation  abortion  reproductive and sexual health  and global sex education  he noted the sovereign right of all countries to implement recommendations in line with national legislation  with respect to different moral and religious values. BHAGWANT SINGH BISHNOI (India) pointed to substantial declines in infant and maternal mortality rates thanks to targeted solutions and other interventions.  Promoting the health and well-being of young people was a Government priority.  Reproductive health care  including abortion  was among 20 comprehensive health services provided free of cost.  Contraceptives had been given to 100 million women  and the health programme was committed to adding 48 million new clients by 2020.  There had been an expansion of secondary and tertiary education and access to skills development  particularly for women and girls.  The recently launched national adolescent health strategy would offer counselling and services on reproductive and sexual health  nutrition  mental health  violence and injuries  substance use and non-communicable diseases to 250 million young people.  Combating violence against women remained a priority.  Amendments to criminal law had significantly broadened the definition of sexual assault and harassment to include voyeurism  stalking and other behaviour.  Protocols had been developed with police  investigating agencies and other service providers to improve coordinated responses to female victims of violence.  The Government had worked with experienced activists on medical and legal guidelines and protocol for survivors of sexual violence.  India had shared its development experience with developing countries and it was a major source of good quality medicines critical to other countries’ health strategies.  JOSEFINA BUNGE (Argentina) said that the Assembly was gathered to renew and deepen commitment to the Cairo programme beyond 2015.  Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General  she noted that human rights were at the core of it  and that investment in individual such rights  capacity-building and dignity for all  were the basis of sustainable development.  The Argentine Government had achieved goals more demanding than those set internationally  she said  listing accomplishments including the rights of migrants to social services.  Argentina was fully committed to implementation of the Programme of Action pending regional review and beyond 2015. LESLIE BERGER KIERNAN (United States) said that societies where women and girls were safe were more prosperous and stable.  While strides had been made  progress had been uneven.  According to the Review  many countries agreed that those gaps required urgent attention.  Women  young people and those caught in crisis must have access to reproductive rights if such rights were to be for all.  Young people must be empowered.  Their choices would have consequences for the world.  Female genital mutilation  early marriage  and early birth were particular challenges facing young women  and more concrete and decisive steps had to be taken for the empowerment of women and girls.  Gender-based violence must end  and impunity for perpetrators equally so.  Integrating sexual and reproductive health services was also a priority — contraception was not just a matter of convenience  but a matter of life and death.  Family planning could prevent a third of the maternal deaths that occurred each year.  The international community had to continue to push forward; the post-2015 development agenda offered an opportunity for the world to come together.  The United States stood behind that  and fully supported gender equality  which could be one of most transformative goals of the agenda.  That chance must be seized. MAY-ELIN STENER (Norway)  speaking on behalf of the Nordic countries  expressed his commitment to the framework of action for follow-up to the Cairo action programme beyond 2014.  The Secretary-General’s report on that review provided a solid foundation for establishing universal access to reproductive health and rights.  He underlined the need for comprehensive access to sex education.  There was also a need to include in the post-2015 development agenda the right to reproductive healthcare services and access to such services.  It was time to go beyond the Cairo Programme of Action.  Everyone had a right to be free of discrimination. DILYARA RAVILOVA-BOROVIK (Russian Federation) attached great significance to the review of the International Conference on Population and Development  including global socioeconomic cooperation in the post-2015 period.  The key challenge was satisfying the basic requirements of the population  those having to do with access to health care  food  water  energy  and jobs.  It was counterproductive to focus on concepts that were not universally supported  or ran counter to entire countries.  Achieving progress and demographic development  in a sustainable development context  was the state policy of her country.  The challenges were overcoming demographic crises and providing support to the family.  Deeply regretting that the delegations of the Russian Federation and 60 other countries were not able to present those remarks at an earlier opportunity  she noted that her statement was intended to be presented at another level.  Her country wanted to continue dialogue with all  and was prepared to strengthen multilateral cooperation in all areas. KAHA IMNADZE (Georgia) said her country had made significant progress in implementing the Cairo agenda  despite going through socio-economic and political transitions.  National development plans and legislation reflected Cairo priorities in several areas  with historic gains in reproductive health and infant and maternal mortality.  She discussed Georgia’s universal health programme and expansion of social protection schemes for vulnerable populations.  Women’s empowerment was proceeding  with 10 per cent representation in Parliament  and 30 per cent of households led by a female breadwinner.  Success had been recorded in efforts to combat trafficking under the leadership of a National Coordination Council  and a national youth policy had been adopted in 2014.  Much remained to be done  however  and measures to tackle remaining challenges  such as Georgia’s Socioeconomic Development Strategy 2020  targeted sustainable and inclusive growth  demographic improvements and ensuring equal opportunities.  A national human rights strategy and action plan were in place for 2014-2020  as well as an anti-discrimination law. MR. NEKIGUCHI (Japan) said that  in 1994  Japan had launched the Global Issues Initiative on Population and AIDS  and had committed $3 billion to help developing countries with family planning  HIV treatment  maternal and child health and the empowerment of women.  Three months ago the Government organized a symposium on women in Tokyo.  In support of the Nigerian girls kidnapped earlier this year by Boko Haram  it pledged $855 000 to organizations supporting those girls and their families and communities.  The Japan Parliamentarians’ Federation for Population  the world’s first parliamentarian group dedicated to population and sustainable development  had made every effort to advance population issues with counterparts around the world.  He called on the international community to coordinate efforts to address emerging challenges  such as rapid demographic changes and the rapid increase in fertility  unemployment  malnutrition and lack of access to health services in Sub-Saharan Africa.  The low fertility rates found in Asia were also troubling.  The rate at which Japan’s population was ageing was the highest in the world; 1 in 4 people were over 65 years of age.  The world beyond 2015 must deal with complicated challenges and tasks  ensuring maternal and child health  empowering girls and young people  providing health and sexual services and supporting an ageing society.  There may be no miracle solution. GHOLAM HOSSEIN DEHGHANI (Iran) commended the forward-looking approach of the Cairo action plan  stressing the need for progressive attitudes as the world population aged.  With population age structures undergoing an historic transition  Governments needed to focus on improving their citizens’ economic and social lives.  More than half of Iran’s population was under the age of 30  offering a “golden opportunity” to achieve sustainable development.  But it was also necessary to account for ageing.  His country had achieved many of the Millennium Development Goals and aims of the Cairo action plan before their deadlines  notably in health care and education.  Iran faced “illegal  inhuman economic coercive measures” that negatively impacted its ability to provide basic human rights and pursue development.  The sanctions contravened the United Nations Charter and the aims set forth in Cairo. DESRA PERCAYA (Indonesia) said his country’s implementation of the International Conference on Population and Development plan of action had seen poverty decrease from 17 per cent in 2007 to 11.4 per cent in 2013 because of pro-poor  pro-rural development policies.  Known as a leader in family planning  Indonesia’s policies and goals had changed in emphasis from being target-driven to focusing on demand fulfilment.  Indonesia would reach the zenith of its population dividend between 2028 and 2031  when 65 million people would be contributing to the country’s long-term socio-economic development.  Efforts would focus on protecting their health  education and employment rights; and women’s empowerment and gender equality would also be integral to national development.  There had been an increase in the understanding of the interplay between population dynamics and climate change thanks to education policies in Indonesia’s coastal and agricultural areas that focused on risk reduction.  Local Government capacities to undertake mitigation and early warning had also been expanded. FRED SARUFA (Papua New Guinea) pledged to consolidate the gains made in his country since the Cairo conference.  A cornerstone of his Government’s efforts involved encouraging women to take leadership and responsibility for their futures.  Poverty  environmental degradation and inequality must also be addressed.  The natural environment could provide for mankind  but not for man’s greed. Papua New Guinea had committed $10 million for various population and development initiatives.  It was partnering with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for contraceptive implants  and with other organizations to support development of midwifery skills to deal with complicated pregnancies.  The Government had created a National Bank for women and implemented microcredit programmes.  A national strategy aimed to improve the nation’s statistical information management system.  He urged Member States to collectively ensure that every woman throughout her lifetime had access to sexual and reproductive health services  contraceptives and education  and were assured protection of their sexual and reproductive health and rights. EDEL DWYER (Ireland) aligned with the European Union’s statement to the Assembly on 22 September.  Much progress had been made since adoption of the Cairo action programme  but “aggregate progress” often masked “significant unfinished business ” especially where it concerned women’s empowerment  and access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights.  Inequalities stubbornly persisted.  Those who had been left behind by inequality and discrimination  especially women and girls  must now be given priority.  Ireland was committed to implementing the Cairo action programme.  Last year his Government launched its latest Policy for International Development to protect and promote human rights in all its work.  That included a specific commitment to the Cairo action programme  to reduce maternal and infant mortality  promote universal access to reproductive healthcare and family planning services that supported safe motherhood and to fertility control. IOANE NAIVALURUA (Fiji) said there was much progress in the last two decades on population  development and human rights  but there was much to be done.  Fiji  a small country dispersed around outlying islands  had experienced environmental challenges due to climate change  and thus unique challenges for implementing the sustainable development goals.  Fiji’s 2010 Constitution guaranteed the right to health care services  including reproductive health care.  Empowering women was important for equitable development.  Fiji was committed to increasing the participation of women and young people in political  social and economic processes.  On the eve of International Women’s Day this year  Fiji launched its National Gender Policy  a guiding document for mainstreaming gender issues across all sectors.  Noting that statistical data on gender-related issues was often missing from United Nations reports  he stressed the importance of timely data in designing evidence-based programmes as well as adequate resources to implement them.  He called for collaboration among Governments  United Nations agencies and other stakeholders to provide disaggregated and verified population data on the Pacific region. KUNZANG C. NAMGYEL (Bhutan) said the United Nations analysis in her region showed that many significant challenges still required urgent attention to sustain the achievements made since the Cairo Summit.  Bhutan was committed to ensuring development was both inclusive and sustainable  and to remain carbon neutral while overcoming multidimensional poverty.  Bhutan was experiencing a rapid demographic change  with 65 per cent of the population aged 25 and below.  The potential for a “demographic dividend” was at its peak.  Ensuring access to quality education  creating jobs and developing private-sector enterprises were key Government priorities.  A new challenge was providing opportunities for the urban poor as the pace of urbanization intensified and put pressure on infrastructure capacities.  The country’s current five-year development plan placed high priority on gender disaggregated data and steps to foster gender equality in local governments.  Bhutan continued to promote women’s rights and had taken concrete measures to encourage a strong role for civil society. JIM MCLAY (New Zealand) expressed concern for the high rate of violence against women in the Pacific region and nationally.  Providing survivors with immediate  safe access to critical services and involving men and boys in violence-prevention initiatives were essential.  All women should be entitled to accurate information and counselling on a range of affordable  accessible and high-quality contraceptive methods.  New contraceptive technologies in Zealand had  resulted in significant improvements in access to contraception.  In 2010  the Government fully subsidized contraceptive implants.  A key challenge facing the nation was the persistence of ethnic disparities; Maori and Pacific populations were affected disproportionately by negative sexual and reproductive health outcomes.  Addressing the social and economic factors disadvantaging indigenous people was a must.  New Zealand was focused on assisting the Pacific region in implementing the Cairo action programme  including by supporting key multilateral organizations in the region  including UNFPA  the International Planned Parenthood Federation  and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). SHARMAN STONE (Australia) said it was an outrage that on the twentieth anniversary of the Cairo Conference the world was still struggling to ensure fundamental human rights for women and girls  protect them from discrimination and violence and prevent early marriage and early pregnancy.  That women and children bore the brunt of increasingly violent conflict and protracted humanitarian crises around the world must also be addressed.  Advancing the rights of women and girls would take commitment and action.  Australia was committed to ensuring that gender equality  and sexual and reproductive health and rights  were firmly embedded in the post-2015 development agenda.  The country had set a benchmark for its aid programme that at least 80 per cent of all development activities must have a gender-equality focus. FERNANDO JORGE WAHNON FERREIRA (Cabo Verde) said that his country had been putting human beings at the centre of its endeavours.  Listing Cabo Verde’s achievements  he noted that the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) had said his country was on track to achieve Millennium Goal number four on maternal health.  However  the education of a young population and job creation continued to pose challenges to his country.  As a consequence of sound policies and a lower rate of fertility  new challenges had been created on immigration.  That was starting to pressure his country’s social and economic structures.  Cabo Verde was fully committed to the Cairo action programme  and would like to count on the continued strong support of UNFPA in its review of the country. HASSAN HAMID HASSAN (Sudan) recalled that the challenge for his country today was the elimination of poverty  and that the effects of that issue required coordination and cooperation in order for root causes to be dealt with at all levels.  Sudan was going through a phase of demographic transition.  According to a 2008 census  the population was 30 million  a number which was expected to double by 2035.  The secession of South Sudan had established a new reality  and support was required to update demographic data through a new census.  Economic sanctions on the country were adversely affecting development  which was in need of investment to create further opportunities for a better future.  GUILHERME DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil) highlighted the 2013 Montevideo Consensus  which not only recognized the importance of universal access to health and reproductive rights  but also advanced progressive commitments on sexual orientation and gender identity.  Noting the progress his country achieved since the Cairo Conference  he said the percentage of Brazilians living below the extreme poverty line was a third of what it was then.  Per capita income of the poorest Brazilians had increased almost four times faster than that of the richest 10 percent  leading to an unprecedented decline in inequality.  Over the last two decades  average labour income was 60 per cent higher and life expectancy grew by 10 years.  Still  many challenges lay ahead.  Government programmes sought to reverse an historic negative trend resulting from years of insufficient attention to marginalized and vulnerable groups.  Brazil hoped that a global consensus based on the Rio+20 outcome document would foster effective international cooperation to overcome crucial hurdles to equality.  Realizing rights entailed promoting equality and equity within and among countries  securing respect for diversity and improving education  work conditions and opportunities for all. MIGUEL CAMILO RUIZ BLANCO (Colombia) said that his country had decided to implement the Cairo action programme with full support for all population and development rights  including sexual and reproductive rights.  That agenda was fundamental in guiding public policies  and progress had been made on combating poverty.  Colombia had a tailored approach to the needs of many groups  including: children: youth: adolescents; women; the lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender community; people with disabilities and older persons.  Great progress had been made regarding adolescent pregnancies  he said  adding that sexual and reproductive health for all persons was a universal human right.  The synergy between population  development goals and sustainable development was undeniable. TALAIBEK KYDYROV (Kyrgyzstan) said that the Programme of Action on population and development adopted in 1994 still remained relevant today.  Despite challenges  his country had achieved good progress in implementing it.  Kyrgyzstan was a socially-oriented State.  It had ratified seven of nine United Nations conventions on human rights  as well as accepted more than 40 international obligations in the sphere of human rights.  Kyrgyzstan had also adopted laws on international labour migration  internal migration  refugees  combating trafficking and attached great importance to improving health care.  Child mortality has been reduced in the last years  and progress had also been made in reproductive health.  Much remained to be done  however  and to reach its objectives  a national sustainable development strategy had been adopted.  Kyrgyzstan was committed to strengthening international cooperation with other United Nations agencies. ABDERRAZZAK LAASSEL (Morocco) said important progress had been made since the 1994 Cairo Conference and periodic reviews of progress in implementing its action programme.  He welcomed studies and consultations that allowed them to identify areas of difficulty in addressing the issues.  The country had made progress in many areas  he said  pointing to universal access to health care and declines in infant and maternal mortality.  Prenatal consultations and birth monitoring had increased as well  reaching 77.1 per cent and 73.6 per cent respectively  in 2011.  The country had established a strategy to meet the health needs of young people and adolescents in areas such as high-risk abortions  sexually transmitted diseases  gender-based violence and unwanted pregnancies.  The Government had enacted legislative and institutional reforms  as well as harmonized legislation and public policy with internationally ratified conventions relating to population and development. GORDON BRISTOL (Nigeria) said a window of opportunity had been provided for Member States to share best practices to improve the lives of the vulnerable.  He stressed the need for an effective framework for emerging population and development issues.  There must be an assessment of the amount being invested in the lives of people  especially women and young girls.  He affirmed his country’s commitment to the Cairo action programme.  Beyond 2014  the population and development agenda must focus on quality investment in education  improved healthcare  the democratic dividend  eradication of hunger  improved health of adolescents  and reduction of maternal and infant mortality.  It must also include policies that supported the elderly  especially older women  and that fostered capacity-building and the use of modern technology for effective monitoring and evaluation of population and development programmes. CHRISTOPHER GRIMA (Malta) said the Cairo Conference in 1994 resulted in the recognition that “population was not just about people  but about making people count”.  The action programme had shifted focus from numbers to human rights  and conference outcomes had been endorsed in the Millennium Development Goals  being featured prominently within them.  They should also form part of the post-2015 development agenda.  Future progress had to be universal  ensuring individual dignity and a human rights-based approach.  He identified progress for women since adoption of the Programme of Action  including participation across economic sectors and improvements in education.  Acknowledging the challenges of poverty  climate change and diseases  he noted the threat they posed to fulfilment of the Cairo action programme.  He regretted a recent focus on chapters in the Programme of Action dealing with reproductive rights and stated that no part of the document imparted an obligation that abortion be considered a legitimate reproductive health right.  The right to life was fundamental and it began at the moment of conception.  Abortion was a denial of that right.   AMANUEL GIORGIO (Eritrea) said the post-2015 development agenda must take into account the specific priorities of every State.  The overarching goal to eradicate poverty must be met.  The Eritrean Government had promoted the involvement of grassroots communities in the design of development programmes.  That had proven to be a successful strategy.  But more needed to be done to further empower women and girls  end child marriage and continue to build human capacity especially among youth  among other objectives.  Since the adoption of the Cairo action programme  migration issues had become an increasing concern of world organizations.  The relationship between migration and development in developing countries had to be addressed. HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia) said that significant progress had been made since 1994.  However  the changing world had been presenting both opportunities and challenges to the post-2015 development agenda.  Malaysia had achieved most of the objectives of the Cairo Programme of Action  and key enabling factors had been the country's political stability  unity  strength in diversity and abundant natural resources.  All that had contributed to the country's success in achieving the programme’s goals  as well as other development goals.  Poverty eradication programmes had been effective in reducing poverty to just 1.7 per cent in 2012  and the rate of extreme poverty had also decreased.  The Government had given special attention to women's education  and announced its intention to increase the number of women in the public sector.  Listing several achievements within the health care sector  he turned to demographic issues  noting that as the country's total fertility rate had been declining  that would have profound effects on the nation's composition. LIBRAN L. CABACTULAN (Philippines) said that his country had translated economic gain to generate employment and sustainable livelihoods  and had provided basic services to around 4.4 million poor families.  His country was a front liner in championing the empowerment of women and gender equality  with Filipino women being listed as among the ten highest worldwide in economic and political status.  The country has supported initiatives to eliminate discrimination among women and girls in all forms and the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012  in tandem with the Universal Health Care framework  had mobilized a wide range of family planning information and services.  Also being set in place were policies for the right to move internally and be ensured access to social protection  basic services  employment and the use of natural resources.  Those protections had been extended to the 10 million Filipinos living overseas who contributed $22.8 billion in remittances in 2013.  Population dynamics had been consciously integrated in development initiatives  particularly climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction.  Nonetheless there were significant challenges still  especially in the area of promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights. AARON HOLTZ (United Kingdom) said that in this anniversary year for the Cairo Programme of Action  the review process had allowed the international community to reflect upon achievements.  The process had also highlighted that while progress had been made  much remained to be done.  Many girls were still unable to decide on family planning matters  and too many were denied the comprehensive sexuality education needed to make informed decisions about their lives.  Sustainable development could not be achieved if discrimination prevailed.  Two critical barriers to progress were female genital mutilation and early forced marriage.  Culture and tradition should never be invoked by Member States as a reason to deny rights to their citizens. ANDIANARIVELO RAZAFY (Madagascar) said five years of political crisis had left his country drained  and as a result  the majority of the Madagascar population was vulnerable.  The country had been working on new initiatives using multi-disciplinary studies to achieve improvements in health  nutrition  access to drinking water and environmental preservation  among others.  It had drawn up a legal framework to respond to the needs of older persons  updated policies in the health sector  and conducted anthropological studies of households in order to understand the causes of and solutions for poverty.  The Government had worked to improve nutrition and health care services and had launched programmes for basic social services and child and maternal health.  Looking forward  the country’s development plan would form the core for sustainable action.  Madagascar faced huge challenges  and needed a harmonized social protection system and improvements in governance and public affairs.  The country was advancing towards inclusive development and was “ready to fight” to overcome all obstacles. TUY RU (Cambodia) said that considerable progress had been made since his country had affirmed its commitment to the Cairo Programme of Action  in areas of health and gender equality  in particular.  Endorsing UNFPA’s operational review of the implementation of the Programme of Action  he listed areas in which Cambodia had made extensive progress.  These included strengthening women's empowerment  forging new partnerships with civil society and addressing issues of adolescent sexual reproductive health and rights.  To enable developing countries to fully implement the Programme of Action  the mobilization of resources and effective use of financing were essential. MWABA PATRICIA KASESE-BOTA (Zambia) stressed that the 2014 review of the Cairo Conference had significant links to and implications for the Beijing+20 reviews as well as the post-2015 development agenda.  Zambia prioritized investments in the development needs of the young  who comprised 45.5 per cent of the population  and gender equality and women’s empowerment were central to its development agenda.  Zambia was committed to the full implementation of the action programme beyond 2014  she said  stressing that sexual and reproductive health and rights  population and development  and education and gender equality  were integrally linked to the eradication of poverty and achievement of sustainable development. Mr. BARNIKO (Kiribati) stressed the need to continue the “innovative and courageous” work encapsulated in the Cairo Programme of Action and ensure such responsibility encompassed the conception of people as global citizens of a global village.  Investments in people such as reducing prejudice  improving choice  lowering barriers and preserving the environment  were investments in the future.  The recent Summit on climate change had to be followed by action.  Noting the world’s great diversity - from development progress to demographics to security challenges – unity was needed in agreeing a new development framework.  It was important to appreciate the intricate linkages between individual national development paths.  Melting Arctic ice sheets  for example  would affect the opposite side of the globe  particularly low-lying atoll island nations like his  which were on the frontline of climate change and sea-level rise.  Immediate  visionary and innovative leadership and action were needed  as climate change was a survival issue  a security issue and an issue of human rights and dignity. AHMED SAREER (Maldives) said his country had brought down maternal and infant mortality rates and was consistently maintaining a national reading rate of 98 per cent.  Five of the eight Millennium goals had been realized.  Although on-track towards realizing the remaining three goals  climate change threatened that achievement.  The Government had adopted a zero tolerance policy for violence against women and a reproductive health policy.  With children and youth accounting for 44 per cent of the population  catering to their needs had been a priority.  Because unemployment was a grave concern  there were plans to develop a youth city  programs to identify and support vulnerable groups  and an umbrella program that included a “no child left behind” policy.  Conducting a national census would play a central role in understanding the population.  Collecting data on the migrant population would also allow the Government to provide for migrant workers who make up an estimated one third of the population.  The country’s most precious resource was its people  he said  adding  without human development  sustainable development cannot be accomplished. ARCHBISHOP BERNARDITO CLEOPAS AUZA  Permanent Observer of the Holy See  expressed deep concerns for the 1.2 billion people living in extreme poverty.  Noting the importance of the family to social and economic development  Governments should show solidarity with poor families and the most vulnerable.  Policy-makers and segments of societies viewed migrations negatively  promoting policies detrimental to migrants’ rights and dignity.  Quality education was the most effective means to promote sustainable development  and he emphasized the importance of women’s education to their empowerment within society.  Efforts to address maternal health were at times hampered by policies that failed to account for the right to life of the unborn child.  The idea of a “right to abortion” violated language of the International Conference on Population and Development  he said. AMY MUEDIN  representative of the International Organization for Migration (IOM)  said that one of the most significant contributions of the 1994 conference was catalysing the global debate on migration that had happened since that time.  Contemporary migration patterns were today more complex than they had been in the 1990s  as migrants were now of more diverse backgrounds  among other differences.  IOM fully supported recent reports of the Commission on Population and Development  which noted that migration had increased in scope and impact.  Her Organization further supported the call on all States to protect the human rights of all migrants.  The action programme on migration provided important lessons as the international community transitioned to the post-2015 development agenda.  Working with its partners  civil society among them  IOM was helping to monitor the development potential of migration.  Migration was inevitable and also necessary to meet labour demands.  It was desirable for migrants and host nations alike. ISLAM ABDULLAH HASSAN AL-AMRI  representative of the League of Arab States  said that today’s meeting was an important one  emphasizing the weight the Arab League accorded to issues discussed.  Obstacles in the face of achieving the Millennium Development Goals must be overcome  he said  adding that the Arab League commended efforts made by Arab States in meeting challenges in areas of population as well as the advancement of women's rights and gender equality.  The 2013 Cairo Declaration  which was endorsed by all Arab states  had expressed the Arab League’s commitment to International Conference on Population and Development goals beyond 2014 as well as post-2015 development goals. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-09,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gal3477.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Finding a balance between the international and national dimensions of the rule of law was indispensable to furthering the principle’s just implementation  speakers told the Sixth (Legal) Committee as it opened deliberations on the topic. Speaking for the Non-Aligned Movement  Iran’s representative said that while the United Nations must oversee the exercise of international law  it must not replace national law.  Rather  it should enhance national capacity-building at the request of recipient Governments  taking into account national customs and realities in order to avoid imposing models that would inhibit resolving national problems. Indeed  Cuba’s representative said that promoting and strengthening the rule of law started from recognizing the right of States to determine their own national legal and political systems that respected their unique cultures.  A proper balance between international and national rule of law  therefore  must be maintained. The problem was not in the concept of the rule of law  said the representative of the Russian Federation  as his country had always spoken in favour of strengthening the international and national order.  The choice of model or system of governance should be an internal matter for States  rather than attempting to use indicators of compliance or commitments to bring all States under a single universal model. The representative of Belarus  pointing out that the term had yet to be clearly defined  called for clear distinctions between the rule of law and related notions  such as human rights  access to justice and others  a stance echoed by other delegations. Furthermore  his counterpart from Liechtenstein stated  it was surprising that Member States had been unable to agree on the inclusion of the term “rule of law” in the title of goal 16 of the Sustainable Development Goals  referring to it only as “access to justice”. Finland’s representative  speaking for the Nordic countries  said access to justice would enable sustained economic growth and poverty reduction  while the delegate of Costa Rica  speaking for the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  reminded the Committee that the subtopic of the current session was “Sharing States’ national practices in strengthening the rule of law through access to justice”. Concluding the debate on measures to eliminate international terrorism were representatives of Saudi Arabia  Afghanistan  Kuwait  Tunisia  Myanmar  Azerbaijan  Madagascar  Iran  Libya  Kenya  Botswana  Jordan  Benin  Venezuela  Maldives  Georgia  Uganda  Armenia and Mongolia. Speaking on the matter in exercise of right of reply were representatives of Russian Federation and Georgia. Speaking on the rule of law were delegates from Lao Peoples Democratic Republic (speaking for Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN))  South Africa (speaking for the African Group)  Trinidad and Tobago (speaking for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM))  Australia  Singapore  Republic of Korea  Guatemala  Democratic Republic of Congo  Qatar  Sudan  Libya  Lesotho  Pakistan  Colombia  New Zealand  Switzerland  Poland  Japan and Malaysia    as well as a representative of the European Union. The Committee will meet to continue its consideration of the rule of law at the national and international level at 10:00 a.m. on Friday  10 October. Background The Sixth Committee today would conclude its consideration of measures to eliminate international terrorism (for background see Press Release GA/L/3475)  and take up deliberations on rule of law.  On that topic  it had before it two reports from the Secretary-General on strengthening and coordinating United Nations rule of law activities (documents A/69/181 and A/68/213/Add.1). Statements on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism Mr. ALBOGAMI (Saudi Arabia)  associating himself with Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and the Non-Aligned Movement  noted that his country had provided millions to the United Nations Centre for Combatting Terrorism  which had been successful in combatting extremism at borders  including in the Sahel  and through cooperation with other centres.  He asked that those centres receive support from the international community.  He expressed particular concern about the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)  which covered a significant territory and affected many citizens in Syria and Iraq.  Errors had been made  including the failure to define terrorism  which should recognize the rights of those under foreign occupation.  People in those circumstances suffered greatly  pushing them to turn to extremism.  Expressing support for all international initiatives to find solutions  he said that as recently emerging terrorist groups were well-financed and had broad reach  their financing must be stopped. ZAHIR TANIN (Afghanistan)  associating himself with OIC and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that in the past six months  terrorists and extremist armed groups had taken advantage of the protracted political and electoral crisis and a situation of uncertainty to launch major assaults around Afghanistan  resulting in casualties among civilians and security personnel.  Nonetheless  the national army and police  on the front lines of all counter-terrorism operations  were continuing their effort unabated.  Scores of terrorists and enemy combatants had been killed or captured.  Moreover  hundreds of terrorist plots had been averted in various parts of the country.  As well  the Government continued to engage its neighbours to promote regional cooperation  concerned about the rise of violent acts in the region.  Gravely concerned about the recent significant increase in the number of foreign terrorist fighters among Taliban and Al Qaeda in his country  he welcomed the adoption of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014)  and emphasized the need for further cooperation to address foreign terrorist fighters. BASHAR ABDULAH E R S ALMOWAIZRI (Kuwait)  associating himself with OIC and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that counter-terrorism should be bolstered through measures based on international law  and should address the underlying causes.  Noting that his country had acceded to 18 instruments on the matter  as well as a number of bi-lateral measures  he supported the conclusion of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism  as long as it did not impede the right of peoples to self-determination.  He also welcomed the Security Council resolution on foreign fighters and expressed support for a culture of peace and tolerance  including respect for religious symbols. NOUR ZARROUK BOUMIZA (Tunisia)  associating herself with OIC  the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said combating terrorism required a global strategy at all levels.  For that reason  her Government had criminalized such acts  reforming laws to combat terrorism and money laundering  in line with human rights.  Among initiatives being taken  it was establishing institutions for the training of imams.  In the same vein  a set of measures had just been announced  that included the immediate suspension of activities of non-governmental organizations suspected of having terrorist ties.  Tunisia was committed to judicial prosecution against those accused of inciting hatred or murder.  Regionally and sub-regionally  her country had acceded to almost all initiatives to strengthen counter-terrorism cooperation. U HAN THEIN KYAW (Myanmar)  associating himself with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Non-Aligned Movement  said 2014 was of significance to his country in light of the various counter-terrorism legislation it had enacted.  The Anti-Money Laundering Law was enacted in March  while the Anti-Terrorism Law came into force in June.  It would continue to cooperate with United Nations bodies in developing necessary legislation.  To date  his country had become a State party to 11 international counter-terrorism instruments and a signatory to one; it was looking at the possibility of signing or acceding to more relevant international or regional instruments.  Given the many challenges developing countries face in the fight against terrorism due to lack of capacity and strong institutions  he urged the United Nations and other partners to step up their assistance for capacity building in those countries. HUSNIYYA MAMMADOVA (Azerbaijan)  associating herself with the Non-Aligned Movement and OIC  said that States must observe their international obligations  ensuring  among other things  that their territories are not used for terrorist activity.  Priority and greater support should be accorded to implementing the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in an integrated manner  and relevant Security Council resolutions.  In particular  she urged prompt and effective enforcement of the Council’s sanctions regimes.  Encouraging cooperation on the matter  she stressed the effectiveness of human-centred approaches  and ensuring that the voices of victims be heard.  She enumerated her country’s cooperative efforts internationally and regionally  as well as its implementation of national legislation on money-laundering and terrorist financing  among others. Stressing the importance of intercultural and interfaith dialogue  she said it was a privilege for Azerbaijan to host the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (AOC) Seventh Global Forum in 2016. LYDIA RANDRIANARIVONY (Madagascar)  associating herself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said her country was facing full national reconstruction following five years of crisis.  As part of its counter-terrorism efforts  it had recently adopted laws on combatting terrorism and transnational organized crime  which included criminalization of terrorism financing.  The new Government of her country was also working to elaborate a new draft law on mutual judicial assistance.  At the regional level  Madagascar had hosted the 2013 annual meeting of the Justice Platform of Indian Ocean Countries on judicial cooperation  in the fight against terrorism and transnational organized crime.  She expressed support for the upcoming workshops on counter-terrorism strategy for experts of member countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).  Currently  her Government was proceeding to ratification of the Rabat Declaration  concluded in Morocco on mutual judicial assistance. HOSSEIN GHARIBI (Iran)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and OIC  stressed the need to include State terrorism in combatting international terrorism  noting that the comprehensive convention on the matter should also address the issue.  The uninhibited violence and extremism presently threatening the world could not be resolved without accurately understanding how the situation had come about.  Furthermore  the unilateral compilations of lists of terrorism-supporting States contravened international law  and only served political ends.  Attention was also needed to the listing and delisting of terrorist organizations  as one such that targeted Iranian citizens had been delisted; although  while on the list  its leaders and perpetrators had enjoyed impunity.  In addition  the financing of terrorism must be addressed in an impartial  objective  technical and non-political manner.  Responding to a statement from the Israeli delegation  he said that the Committee’s time should not be wasted in making political accusations.  The State of Israel had been illegitimate from its inception and should not accuse others  while its acts in Gaza had caused untold suffering to people already struggling under eight years of blockade.  The international community should stop Israel’s State terrorism. ESSA A. E. ESSA (Libya)  associating himself with OIC and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that his country  which was grappling with terrorism  was acceding to international and regional counter-terrorism instruments  as well as concluding a bilateral convention on cooperation to combat terrorism.  Its Parliament had recently enacted a law on the matter  through which a national committee would be set up and tasked with studying the scourge  including financing  modernizing legislation  helping victims of terrorism and implementing General Assembly resolutions.  He expressed hope that Libyan authorities would be assisted in their efforts to strengthen the army and policy.  The country’s interim Government was intensifying efforts to monitor borders and to combat transnational crimes  such as smuggling arms and persons and trading in drugs.  While his delegation welcomed Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) on foreign terrorist fighters  he emphasized that the phenomenon must be addressed by tightening border control and impeding finance sources. ANDREW M. KITHURANI (Kenya)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said the principal terrorist threat in his country came from Al-Shabaab.  Since the merger of that armed group with Al-Qaeda  it was expanding its links with other terrorist organizations  including ISIL  with many of Al-Shabaab’s fighters travelling to Syria and Iraq.  Boko Haram was also pursuing ideological links with Al-Shabaab towards establishing a caliphate in the region.  Recognizing the need to share intelligence and resources among Governments  Kenya was investing in combating extremists  terrorists and foreign terrorist fighters  and was seeking global partners.  National policies were being aimed at tackling economic hardships  particularly through measures to provide youth employment.  As that took time  counter-radicalization initiatives to identify and arrest the indoctrinators of youth and to prevent those most at risk from becoming terrorists were being implemented.  Kenya contributed to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) to prevent that country from reverting to a refuge for Al-Shabaab.  However  there was an urgent need for air and marine support to AMISOM. NKOLOI NKOLOI (Botswana)  associating himself with the African Group and Non-Aligned Movement  said his delegation had been following with horror and disbelief the emergence of violent extremist groups and foreign terrorist fighters who had no regard for human life.  The recent spate of beheadings captured on video by those “savage” groups proved that no nation could single-handedly fight and root out organized terror.  However  the Secretary-General’s efforts to fight terrorism were encouraging  and he welcomed the adoption of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014).  He emphasized that all States must share information and experiences on any infiltration by armed militias and terrorist fighters on its shores.  As well  they should make it illegal for their nationals to join  sponsor or take part in activities of terrorist groups anywhere in the world. Mr. ALBSOUL (Jordan)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and OIC  expressed concern about the increase in terrorist acts in the Middle East  and the developed military and financial capability of terrorist groups that continued to perpetrate crimes against civilians.  Security Council resolutions that sought to counter terrorism were valued in that regard.  His Government had taken steps to fight terrorism  particularly through new provisions introduced into its laws  such as the penal code on terrorism and anti-money laundering.  In addition  steps were being taken to ensure that relevant entities were implementing Security Council resolutions effectively and in complete adherence.  His country had also criminalized acts of those who joined terrorist groups outside and in Jordan  and recruited individuals. JEAN-FRANCIS R. ZINSOU (Benin)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  expressed support for Security Council resolutions 2178 (2014) and 2170 (2014)  which along with the entire legal anti-terrorism arsenal  must be reinforced by a comprehensive convention on terrorism  and must be finalized.  Since 2013  Benin had been working to establish a police information system for West Africa  with support from the European Union  and was also an active participant in the struggle against Boko Haram.  He also stressed the need to eliminate financing for terrorism.  The rapid and coordinated implementation of all aspects of the Global Strategy for the Sahel must be deployed to build the capacity of people in the region to resist terrorists.  Further poverty  youth unemployment and other vulnerabilities that facilitated the recruitment of youth must be addressed.  To that end  peace and sustainable development should be pursued in a coordinated and coherent manner. HENRY SUAREZ (Venezuela)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  recalled the recent Community summit meeting during which members reaffirmed that extradition was an essential tool in the fight against terrorism.  Bearing in mind the Extradition Treaty of 1922 with the United States and the provisions in the annex of General Assembly resolution 60/288  he reiterated his country’s request for the extradition of terrorist Luis Posada Carriles  whose terrorist act in 1976 caused the death of 73 innocent civilians.  Raul Diaz Pena  Jose Antonio Colina and German Rodolfo Valera  accused of and charged by the Venezuelan judiciary of carrying out terrorist acts  should also be extradited.  Calling attention to some States engaging in illegal practices that violated international law  he also said that the unilateral drafting of a list of countries that were allegedly linked to terrorism should be put to an end. JEFFREY SALIM WAHEED (Maldives) said that terrorism could only be addressed by complementing implementation of universal instruments with regional and sub-regional activities.  His country was working regionally on capacity-building and technical cooperation  as well as participating in a regional financial action taskforce on money laundering.  It also was participating in bi-lateral exercises and training to combat terrorism.  National policies were in place to root out extremist ideologies  monitor threats and prosecute offenders.  A new anti-terrorism bill was being formulated in response to new and emerging threats.  International assistance was of paramount importance to a country like the Maldives  which had a vast geographical area to monitor. INGA KANCHAVELI (Georgia) said her Government had signed and ratified universal  regional and bilateral counter-terrorism instruments  and implemented them into national policy and legislation.  As well  it had implemented relevant Security Council resolutions and recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on financing terrorism  and had developed a coordination mechanism and a national strategy and action plan for combating terrorism financing.  Her country was a party to the 13 international counter-terrorism instruments and two Council of Europe counter-terrorism conventions  all of which had been implemented into national legislation.  In compliance with Security Council resolutions  a list of persons suspected of terrorist activities or being in relation with entities suspected of the same  was being maintained  which was regularly updated based on operative information  shared with relevant State structures  and regularly checked against the lists maintained under Security Council resolution 1267 (1999).  Recalling that 20 per cent of her nation’s territory remained under the Russian Federation’s illegal military occupation  she emphasized that when her Government was denied de facto control over its regions  the overall responsibility for the security situation rested solely with the State exercising the effective control. DUNCAN LAKI MUHUMUZA (Uganda)  associating himself with the African Group  OIC and the Non-Aligned Movement  expressed support for convening a high-level conference to respond to terrorism.  Pointing out that his country had long been engaged in the fight against terrorism and had successfully routed the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA)  he said that the armed group continued to cause suffering in the Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Terrorists must have no safe havens  and efforts must be stepped up in Somalia to build institutions that would prevent terrorist organizations from seeing that country as such.  Noting that recourse to justice was important in fighting terrorism  he said that suspects just recently arrested were now awaiting trial in Uganda.  Nonetheless  his country would not let down its guard on the military front.  He stressed unheeded appeals to stop toxic waste dumping in Somalia  as those sites could be turned into arsenals for the terrorists if they could recycle those materials to create weapons of mass destruction.  The responsible parties must be required to clean up their mess. ZOHRAB MNATSAKANYAN (Armenia)  associating himself with the European Union Delegation  condemned the recent terrorist acts and denounced all manifestations of that “evil”  regardless of its geography and motivations.  With catastrophic situations in Syria and the north of Iraq directly imperiling tens of thousands of Armenians of Aleppo  he reiterated the need to defend the Armenian population of Syria and Yezidi  and Christian communities in northwestern Iraq.  His country supported the recent Security Council resolutions 2133 (2014)  2170 (2014) and 2178 (2014).  Armenia had taken important steps in the fight against international terrorism  which included improvements to its border security  significant changes to exports control laws  and the holding of and actively participating in international anti-terrorism workshops and training courses. Mr. GANBOLD (Mongolia) said that his country fully supported the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and its four pillars  and was a party to the majority of international counter-terrorism instruments.  It had also strengthened its counter-terrorism regime  notably through 2013 and 2014 legislative amendments to the Anti-Terrorism Law  the Law on Combating Money-Laundering and Terrorist Financing  the Criminal Code  and the Code of Criminal Procedure.  Moreover  he took note of the work of the Security Council Sanctions Committees and the efforts taken towards freezing the assets and blocking the financial transactions of terrorist organizations and individuals  and towards preventing the entry into or transit through territories of Member States by designated individuals. Right of Reply In exercise of the right of reply  a Russian Federation’s representative recalled that his country did not have effective control over the territories of which the Georgian delegation spoke.  That had nothing to do with occupation and did not reflect reality.  Those territories had their own individual security policy  as independent Governments and States  which they were carrying out individually and in accordance with their international obligations. A representative of Georgia  in exercise of the right of reply  said it was not the first time that the Russian Federation had tried to justify its illegal activities.  The territorial sovereignty of Member States was a timeless principle enshrined in the United Nations Charter and numerous General Assembly and Security Council resolutions  which supported the territorial integrity of her country  and included [South Ossetia and Abkhazia] as integral parts of it.  She had voiced concern over those two regions because it was due to Russia that there was no international presence there.  Occupied forces were blocking access.  Her country was committed to international peace and security; a united Georgia would be a stronger partner in that endeavour. Statements on the Rule of Law at National and International Levels GHOLAMHOSSEIN DEHGHANI (Iran)  speaking for the Non-Aligned Movement  said that maintaining balance was indispensable in developing national and international dimensions of the rule of law.  States should be encouraged to use tools established under international law  including the International Court of Justice  for peaceful resolution of conflicts.  All States should fulfil their obligations to promote  observe and protect human rights and freedoms for all in accordance with the Charter  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant documents.  However  the application of unilateral measures was of concern  as they negatively impacted both the rule of law and international relations. He also expressed concern at the Security Council’s encroachment on the functions and powers of the General Assembly and Economic and Social Council.  While the Organization must oversee the exercise of international law  it must not replace national law.  Rather it should enhance national capacity-building at the request of recipient Governments  taking into account national customs and realities in order to avoid imposing models that would inhibit resolving national problems.  Pointing out that there was no agreed definition of rule of law  the Rule of Law Unit must recognize that indicators were not acceptable if they had not been agreed upon by Member States.  Commending General Assembly resolution 67/19 that recognized the Non-Member Observer State of Palestine  he voiced support for its full membership in the United Nations. KHIANE PHANSOURIVONG (Lao People’s Democratic Republic)  speaking for ASEAN  said that the inter-governmental regional organization attached great importance to enhancing the rule of law as it moved forward to realize the ASEAN Community by the end of 2015.  It was in the midst of developing and strengthening relevant national institutions and legal frameworks to fulfil ASEAN obligations and commitments under the United Nations Charter.  Many non-regional States had acceded  and were keen to accede to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia as a code of conduct governing the relations between States. To promote friendly relations among participating countries  the Declaration of the East Asia Summit on the Principles for Mutually Beneficial Relations had been adopted in 2011  she went on to say.  As well  the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea had been adopted in 2002  and currently its Member States were expeditiously working towards the early conclusion of the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea.  It also had established an inter-governmental commission charged with the promotion and protection of human rights  and in 2012  ASEAN leaders had adopted a human rights declaration  which established a framework for human rights cooperation in the region. THEMBILE ELPHUS JOYINI (South Africa)  speaking for the African Group  stressed that the provision of legal aid was a concrete way in which access to justice and the rule of law could be strengthened.  Thus  Member States must provide legal aid to the poor and vulnerable.  Well-functioning justice institutions bound by the rule of law were critical to peace-building and consolidating development gains.  Also key was building Member States’ capacity  including through enhanced technical assistance.  Capacity building and rule of law activities should be anchored by two interrelated concepts in determining needs and priorities  namely effectiveness and local or national ownership.  The customs  political and socioeconomic realities  and laws of each recipient State must be taken into account. He went on to note the various activities of the Rule of Law Unit under the guidance of Rule of Law Coordination and Resource Group  which aimed at bringing about better coherence and coordination in rule of law capacity building  both within the Organization and at the country level.  While the multifaceted application of the rule of law at the international and national levels had led to its consideration in different fora and committees within the United Nations  the Sixth Committee was the most suitable place to consider all aspects of the principle in the future  so as to ensure its coherent and continuous development. LIZANNE ACHING (Trinidad and Tobago)  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  and associating herself with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Non-Aligned Movement  welcomed additional initiatives aimed at providing training and education in the area of international law  especially to developing countries.  An important aspect of that capacity building was undertaken through the Programme of Assistance in the Teaching  Study  Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law.  In that regard  she called for the strengthening of that Programme through funding from the regular budget  noting that the current situation  which was based on a system of voluntary contributions  had never been contemplated when the Programme began its operations  and was undermining its effectiveness. She underscored CARICOM’s strong opposition to impunity  noting that member States’ legal systems also incorporated provisions relating to equality before the law.  Those were also buttressed by various international treaties and conventions that promoted the rule of law  of which CARICOM States were signatories.  As a region disproportionately affected by the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons  it looked forward to the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty in December of this year.  Among others  it also looked forward to beginning work on an international instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  focusing on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.  As a group of countries from a region highly vulnerable to the unprecedented loss of marine biodiversity and the impact of unsustainable practices on the marine environment  it viewed the conclusion of a legally binding instrument to address those matters as inextricably linked to its pursuit of justice and fairness for all. GEORGINA GUILLÉN-GRILLO (Costa Rica)  speaking for the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  said the Community was founded on the peaceful settlement of disputes  respect for the self-determination of peoples under colonial domination and foreign occupation  non-intervention in the internal affairs of each country  and the rule of law at national and international levels  among other principles.  She underscored the importance of rejuvenating the General Assembly  strengthening the Economic and Social Council and reforming the Security Council  so that they would be more transparent and effective.  The reforming of the Bretton Woods institutions was also important. She went on to say that the rule of law was essential for inclusive economic growth and sustainable development  to name a few.  The Outcome Document of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development had included “access to justice for all”  among its targets.  That document must be the basis for integrating those goals into the new development agenda  and should not be re-opened.  Pointing to the sub-topic for the Committee’s current session  “Sharing States’ national practices in strengthening the rule of law through access to justice”  she underscored the right of equal access to justice for all  including members of vulnerable groups.  It was of importance to raise awareness about legal rights  she said  affirming her commitment to take all necessary steps to provide fair  transparent  effective  non-discriminatory and accountable services that would promote that access  including legal aid. GILLES MARHIC  associating himself with the European Union Delegation  said that the 2014-2020 European Union Justice Programme provided funding for schemes which aimed to create a truly European area of justice.  The European Union was also prioritizing rule of law issues in its relations with enlargement countries  including through structured dialogues and targeted financial support.  Mobile legal aid clinics and mobile courts  construction of new courthouses  increased awareness and accessible legal services in rural and remote areas  as well as publication of material with guidance for policy makers and practitioners  were significant tools towards people’s legal empowerment.  They must continue in a sustainable way  including through dialogue and various initiatives  such as the Conference organised in July by Italy as President of the Council of the European Union in collaboration with United Nations entities and the International Development Law Organization. Through its financial instruments  the European Union was providing concrete rule of law assistance to many countries  particularly with access to justice  he went on to say.  The European Union Justice Support Programmes implemented in Tunisia  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Guatemala  Philippines and Benin  among others  were complemented by multilateral and bilateral assistance provided by its member States.  In addition  many of the Union’s civilian crisis management operations also focused on the rule of law.  He called for stronger language on the rule of law to be included in the proposal of the Open Working Group for Sustainable Development Goals.  It would also be important for the General Assembly to consider ways in which linkages between the rule of law  human rights  peace and security  and development could be strengthened. LIISA VALJENTO (Finland)  speaking for the Nordic Countries  urged the United Nations to intensify efforts to promote norms  standards and understanding of the rule of law.  She called on Member States that had not yet done so to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.  As well  the Organization should strengthen its cooperation with the International Criminal Court.  The Justice Rapid Response  which offered high quality assistance to national Governments  was also of importance.  Strengthening the rule of law at the national and international levels could only be achieved through a comprehensive approach from the Organization and its Member States  she said  suggesting a follow-up to the recent High-level meeting that would promote a forward-looking strategy towards achieving common goals. She further noted that the United Nations’ support for constitution drafting and legal reforms at country levels was crucial.  Access to justice would enable sustained economic growth and poverty reduction.  Furthermore  ensuring all persons access to a legal identity would be a first step in the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies and  in turn  would ensure access to justice for all.  She acknowledged the role of civil society in advancing the rule of law through raising awareness  fact finding and advocacy  facilitating dialog  and providing assistance to victims.  “We must make certain that our close cooperation with other stakeholders will continue in promoting the rule of law and access to justice ” she said. Mr. SPRESOV (Belarus)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  said rule of law was linked not only with sustainable development  but with any other important issue on the international agenda.  That link should not be used to politicize or erode the concept under the pretext of its cross-cutting character.  The rule of law should be achieved by having States fulfil their national obligations  while international organizations complied with their mandates.  His delegation had consistently spoken in favour of developing a clear and conceptual framework with an unambiguous definition of the term.  He also called for strict respect for clear distinctions of rule of law and related notions  such as human rights  access to justice and others outlined in the 2012 Declaration on the Rule of Law.  On access to justice  he highlighted the need to provide relevant assistance to States towards harmonizing best practices based on universal legal values  while taking into account the specificities of various national institutions. JULIA O’BRIEN (Australia) said that her country  as an elected member of the Security Council  had advocated for sufficient authority  clarity and direction to be given to United Nations peacekeeping missions to carry out their rule of law mandates  and that such mandates be given appropriate priority within missions.  Successful rule of law interventions conducted with the host State could significantly reduce the likelihood of the outbreak or resumption of conflict  as well as crimes of mass atrocity.  In its region and elsewhere  she said her country was helping to build effective law and justice systems to increase the safety and security of communities  improve people’s access to justice  and address violence against women  stressing that national ownership and leadership were vital for the success of such initiatives. TANIERIS DIEGUEZ LAO (Cuba)  associating with the Non–Aligned Movement and Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  said that genuine rule of law lay in a reformed United Nations.  Therefore  the pivotal role played by the General Assembly  as the sole body representing all Member States  must be strengthened.  In addition  reform of the Security Council should genuinely reflect the international community.  She did not support the statement in the report under consideration that the Council had made contributions to the rule of law  as the actions of the Council and several of its members had had the opposite effect.  Prohibition of the use of force and the non-interference in internal affairs of States must be observed.  Promoting and strengthening the rule of law started from recognizing the right of States to determine their own national legal and political systems  in keeping with their cultures.  Any attempt to undercut the issue of rule of law by claiming that it was a cross-cutting issue was to be rejected.  Furthermore  the report did not provide for proper balance between international and national rule of law  and she questioned on what parameters and on whose authority it would be determined which States had weak rule of law.  As well  she condemned and called for the immediate roll-back for the entire set of laws that made up the economic and trade embargo against Cuba for more than 50 years  urging the United States to abide by the numerous Assembly resolutions on the matter. STEFAN BARRIGA (Liechtenstein) said that given the strong consensus on the importance of the core elements of the rule of law  it was surprising that Member States had not been able to agree on the inclusion of the term “rule of law” in the title of goal 16 of the Sustainable Development Goals; it was now only referred to “access to justice”.  The agreed sub-topic of the Committee’s debate this year dealt with “strengthening the rule of law through access to justice”.  He voiced hope that the conceptual incoherence could still be corrected in the course of the remaining work on the post-2015 development agenda.  While the International Criminal Court overall had struck the right balance in applying the principle  the international community must redouble its efforts to strengthen the capacity of domestic justice systems  especially since the Court could only try a small number of perpetrators  or may not have jurisdiction in the first place. NATALIE MORRIS-SHARMA (Singapore)  associating herself with ASEAN and the Non-Aligned Movement  said the rule of law had been and would remain a cornerstone of her country’s stability.  Speaking on access to justice  she highlighted key components that had helped to strengthen the rule of law in Singapore  including that  under the country’s Constitution  all persons were equal before the law and were entitled to equal protection of the law.  Moreover  Singapore had an effective and well-functioning legal system  where laws were administered fairly and impartially  without fear or favour.  In the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014  it had ranked first out of 148 countries in terms of the efficiency of its legal framework in settling disputes.  Finally  Singapore’s laws were fair and predictable  with the country embarking on a new project called “Plain Laws Understandable by Singaporeans” to improve accessibility. LEE MOON-HEE (Republic of Korea) said that his country’s experience showed that implementation of the rule of law fostered economic and social development. In his country  access to justice rested on the principles of openness  transparency of legal systems and the responsiveness of judicial authorities.  That entailed providing access to information.  All court judgments and prosecutors’ decisions were publicly available; electronic litigation system was in place and information on national laws was accessible online and off.  The Republic of Korea also offered proactive and pro bono legal support  including free public attorneys  litigation aid and free legal counselling  among others  and promoted access to justice for the socially marginalized. ANA CRISTINA RODRÍGUEZ PINEDA (Guatemala)  associating herself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  emphasized that access to justice could not be measured in terms of numbers; standards of quality were also needed.  A high level of impunity in her country had undermined the rule of law.  However  cooperation with United Nations agencies had helped reduce its rate of impunity for murder in recent years.  Expressing concern over the increase in criticisms and questions with regard to the rule of law within the Organization  including its scope  purpose and relevance  she pointed out that any support to strengthen a State’s rule of law must take into account national ownership.  The main function of the Secretary-General was not to create an international mechanism that replaced national capacity  but to strengthen national capacity in the area of justice.  Her country’s experience was consistent with that.  Also  the Sixth Committee did not have a monopoly on the topic.  The rule of law was cross cutting and touched on the General Assembly’s work  as well as that of other United Nations bodies. JOHN MUAMBA (Democratic Republic of the Congo)  associating with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  noted that certain obligations under the Follow-up Mechanism for Peace  Security and Cooperation for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the region had been met  among them elections and establishing amnesty for acts of war.  Steps had also been taken for an overall reform of the justice system  notably with respect to its super structure  which had just led to the establishment of a Constitutional Court.  International assistance would be needed if the rule of law were to become a reality on the ground.  He expressed satisfaction that progress was being made on sexual violence and the recruitment of children  noting that several senior officers in the Eastern part of the country had been apprehended  tried and convicted of rape. Mr. AL- KHATER (Qatar) said his country had sought to establish a clear national judiciary to guarantee the rule of law.  The Centre for the Rule of Law for Combatting Corruption in Doha cooperated with the United Nations  and relevant regional organizations towards disseminating  through seminars and workshops  respect for the rule of law.  On a national level  his country had consistently emphasized the need for separation between its three branches of Government. Efforts were also being made to ensure laws were in line with international conventions to which it was a signatory.  In addition  Qatar had contributed to the peaceful resolution of conflicts as part of its commitment to international cooperation and efforts of organizations in the Arab and African regions. MOHAMMED ALI (Sudan)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and African Group  said his country was making efforts to bring its laws into conformity with international standards.  The Charter formed a comprehensive basis at the national and international levels  and was far removed from interference in the internal affairs of States.  Non-interference was one of the best ways to avoid conflicts and promote the rule of law.  Efforts towards strengthening the principle must be based on consensus without a “one-size-fits-all” approach.  Sharing experiences regarding access to justice would show that no single model could be imposed.  The Secretary-General should focus on technical assistance and capacity-building.  That would help developing countries strengthen their rule of law capacities.  He urged support for fair and just regional and international arbitration tribunals.  If the international community was genuinely interested in promoting the rule of law  international justice must not be politicized. SAMIRA A. ABUBAKAR (Libya)  associating herself with the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that in spite of extraordinary circumstances faced by her country  strengthening the rule of law was one of its priorities  in addition to completion of State reconstruction.  The constituent body for the drafting of the Constitution had been elected and had started work in April this year.  It was expected that once that body finalized the draft  a referendum would take place in 2015.  It had held free and fair legislative elections in June this year  which had led to elections of the House of Representatives that represented Libyans of various political orientations.  It had also promulgated legislation that criminalized torture and discrimination and had enacted law on transitional justice and the treatment of victims of sexual violence  as well as counter terrorism law.  She commended the United Nations for providing technical assistance and assisting in capacity building efforts to give impulse to her country’s democratic transition. KELEBONE A. MAOPE (Lesotho)  associating his delegation with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said that a global partnership was needed to enhance the capacity of developing countries to carry out their international obligations.  At the national level  Lesotho had made strides in strengthening the rule of law through a broad spectrum of legal and institutional frameworks safeguarding constitutional governance  and protecting human rights  particularly in the areas of sexual offences and gender equality  and children’s welfare  among others.  Apart from the ordinary courts  specialized courts had been established including commercial  labour  and children’s courts  as well as court martial and small claims courts. MASOOD KHAN (Pakistan)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that the essence of the rule of law was access to justice  and the essence of access to justice was the legal empowerment of people so that they could enjoy their full civil  political  and social rights  among others.  Over the years  his country had made efforts towards its judicial system being more accessible and responsive  including speedy and inexpensive justice  a culture of accountability  and elimination of corruption.  The Government was also focused on developing new laws  strengthening and expanding the network of judicial institutions  increasing the number of judicial officers  and building the capacity of police  prosecutors and judges.  In addition  measures were being made to make justice accessible to the most vulnerable and marginalized segments of society.  Pakistan now had an independent judiciary  free media  and a vibrant civil society.  The Pakistan Law Commission had been entrusted to review all existing laws  and recommended the repeal of outdated laws and amendment of laws in light of new requirements or developments. MIGUEL CAMILO RUIZ BLANCO (Colombia)  associating himself with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  said that the peace process following five decades of war was one of its most important legal activities.  Colombia was currently implementing initiatives with the United Nations country team.  Committed to truth  justice and reparations  his Government had instituted laws providing for the social reintegration of armed fighters  and on reparations for victims of armed conflicts.  In international situations  he said it was important to take into consideration the specific situations of States in formulating law  so as to avoid imposing inappropriate models.  Towards promoting the rule of law  the links between the General Assembly  Economic and Social Council and Security Council should be strengthened. JIM MCLAY (New Zealand) said that in his country a number of initiatives were strengthening access to justice in its communities.  New Zealand also supported promotion of the rule of law in its region and beyond  primarily through assistance and capacity-building initiatives.  Such actions supported its partners’ efforts to build effective law enforcement agencies  ensuring access to legal representation and creating independent and competent judiciaries  which reflected their own national needs and circumstances.  In addition  New Zealand supported the Pacific region with sitting judicial officers where needed  and provided electoral observers both in the Pacific and beyond.  His country had sent observers to the elections in Fiji last month and  under the leadership of Timor Leste  to the elections in Guinea-Bissau in 2013. DAMARIS CARNAL (Switzerland) underscored that it was important to strengthen international judicial bodies  particularly the International Court of Justice. The governance of the United Nations must also be strengthened to improve its credibility  influence and effectiveness.  Therefore  all its bodies should comply with the principles of the rule of law.  Switzerland was committed to an improvement in the Security Council’s working methods and increased observance of procedural safeguards in its sanctions system.  In addition  she welcomed the Secretary-General’s recommendation to conduct  on a regular basis  a full and thorough review of the rule of law and its linkages with the three main pillars of the Organization. MAXIM V. MUSIKHIN (Russian Federation) said that  despite the Secretary-General’s annual report  the topic had not received attention or resources  including strengthening financial allocations for the Programme of Assistance.  As a result  planned regional courses had been cancelled each year.  The Library of Audio Visual Materials was in a similar financial situation.  On the other hand  United Nations structures on rule of law at the national level had not experienced that type of lack of funding.  The problem was not in the concept of the rule of law  as his country had always spoken in favour of strengthening the international and national order.  Rather  he noted attempts to use indicators or measurements of compliance or commitments to bring all States under a single universal model  when the choice of model or system of governance should be an internal matter for States.  The Sixth Committee was the most appropriate forum to discuss the topic of the rule of law.  That format made it possible to avoid unnecessary politicization and to focus on issues of law.  In further work on the rule of law  he said it would be useful to reflect on not using a cookie cutter approach in national measurement of the rule of law  and to highlight the prerogative of States in developing an effective model of rule of law. Slawomir Majszyk (Poland) said his country had been taking measures to ensure efficient functioning of its judicial system  consisting mostly of increasing the efficiency of criminal proceedings  accelerating and simplifying civil proceedings  and enhancing the protection of child victims of crime and of victims of sexual crime and human trafficking.  Moreover  he acknowledged the importance of providing legal assistance to people living in poverty.  In that context  it was crucial to ensure the actual implementation of the principle of equality before courts  and to provide access to free legal assistance during both court and extra-judicial procedures.  Over the past few years  the Ministry of Justice had been implementing a project  “Improving public access to justice”  which had provided for  among others  opportunities for broad access to information about law  educational campaigns for young people and students  improvements in the quality of service for the parties at courts  and expanding alternative methods of dispute resolution. HIROSHI ISHIKAWA (Japan) said that rule of law was a pillar of Japan’s diplomatic policy  consisting of the progressive development of international law and its codification  as well as the peaceful settlement of disputes by fair and impartial application of international law.  To that end  he noted that Japan had accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice  and expressed the hope that those States who had not done so would reconsider.  His Government had also supported the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea  the International Criminal Court and the Permanent Court of Arbitration  both financially and by providing to those courts competent judges.  In addition  regional frameworks played a crucial role in promoting the rule of law  to which Japan gave support.  Japan had also provided support at the national level  especially in the countries of Asia and the Pacific. HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and ASEAN  said the rule of law in his country was guaranteed in the Constitution  as well as in federal and State laws.  Access to justice was also enshrined in that document  and was further exemplified by the role of the country’s Attorney General as the public prosecutor  who exercised his power to protect the interest of the public and the rule of law.  The independence of the judiciary was also guaranteed in the Constitution.  Furthermore  his country had taken legal reforms to uphold the principle of the rule of law through access to justice by conferring the right to legal representation to its citizens.  The National Legal Aid provided free legal assistance to those unable to afford legal fees.  As well  the Legal Aid Department provided legal assistance  as did the Malaysian Bar Council.  His country had also introduced mobile courts in remote areas and established several tribunals that dealt with home buyer or consumer claims. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-09,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gashc4099.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The international community could not afford to work in silos when combating the problems of illicit drugs and other transnational crimes  the Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) heard today during its general discussion of crime prevention  criminal justice  and international drug control. Opening the debate  Yuri V. Fedotov  Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)  called for integrated  comprehensive and coordinated global action to address all aspects of supply and demand of drugs.  The mandate of his office included ending trafficking and all forms of violence against children; reducing illicit financial and arms flows; strengthening recovery and return of stolen assets; combating all forms of organized crime; and reducing corruption. “The focus of law enforcement efforts ” he cautioned  “should be on the real criminals  the drug lords involved in the supply of narcotic substances.” Promoting alternative livelihoods was essential to achieving sustainable reductions in illicit crop cultivation  he continued.  Further  a public health response should consider alternatives to penalization and incarceration of people who use drugs  especially given that only one in six problem drug users were accessing drug dependence treatment services each year. Underscoring the importance of global coordination  he commended high-level  open  inclusive  and informed discussions  facilitated by Khaled Abdel-Rahman Shamaa of Egypt  Chair of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND). Mr. Shamaa then introduced the Commission’s report on international cooperation in this area  calling it a document that enjoyed global ownership and provided a common starting point in preparing for the 2016 General Assembly Special Session on the world drug problem.  The Commission had already created a website (www.ungass2016.org) to enable a global  transparent dialogue and to act as a resource hub for Member States.  It was our “joint responsibility” to use the available tools to fight this global scourge  he concluded. In the general debate that followed  a number of representatives saw the special session as a chance to consolidate regionally and globally coordinated approaches to combating illicit drugs.  A representative of Jamaica  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  said the special session presented an opportunity to assess and address the status of the world drug problem  re-evaluate strategies  and examine best practices.  Like other speakers  he also highlighted regional developments  including the region’s recently adopted crime and security strategy that focused on strengthening resilience to cybercrime  modernizing correctional services  and increasing trans-border intelligence.  Drugs and crime were eroding society  some delegates said.  Morocco’s speaker pointed out that that scourge was hampering sustainable development and must be dealt with multilaterally.  Colombia’s speakers called for transparent and innovative policies and alternative approaches. For some  joint efforts were paying off  some speakers reported.  Speaking on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  Malaysia’s delegate declared that  despite disparities within the region  “a drug–free ASEAN by 2015” was possible.  However  multilateral cooperation was necessary  because advances in technology and transportation had unfortunately resulted in enabling and diversifying transnational crime.  To address that  ASEAN would continue to dialogue with partners beyond the region. Also speaking in today’s debate were the representatives of Congo  Malaysia  Belarus (speaking on behalf of the CIS and in his national capacity)  European Union  Italy  United States  Russia  Cuba  India  Japan  Austria  Thailand  Syria  China  Nicaragua  Singapore  Brazil  Iran  Mexico  Algeria  Malaysia (speaking in his national capacity)  Tajikistan  Libya  Kuwait  Pakistan  Senegal  Ethiopia  Peru  Myanmar  Belarus  Qatar  Ecuador  Bolivia  Kenya  Nigeria  Egypt  and Albania. The Permanent Observer of the Holy See also delivered a statement. A representative of Ukraine spoke in exercise of the right of reply. The Third Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Friday  10 October  to conclude its consideration of this topic. Background The Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) met this morning to begin its general discussion on crime prevention and criminal justice  and on international drug control.  Before it were reports of the Secretary-General on the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (document A/69/92); Implementation of the mandates of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme  with particular reference to the technical cooperation activities of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) (document A/69/94); and Follow-up to the Twelfth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and preparations for the Thirteenth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (document A/69/89). It also had before it notes by the Secretary-General transmitting the reports of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption on its fifth session (document A/69/86); and the outcome of the meeting of the open-ended intergovernmental expert group on the development of a draft set of model strategies and practical measures on the elimination of violence against children in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice (document A/69/88). On the topic of international drug control  the Committee had before it the report of the Secretary-General on International cooperation against the world drug problem (document A/69/111); and a note by the Secretary-General transmitting the report of the Chair of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs on the Outcome of the high-level review by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs at its fifty-seventh session of the implementation by Member States of the Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem (document A/69/87-E/2014/80). Opening Remarks YURI V. FEDOTOV  Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)  assured Member States that his office stood ready to support them in advancing global cooperation in dealing with the threat of transnational organized crime  illicit drugs and corruption.  At the heart of his office’s mandates  he said  were ending trafficking and all forms of violence against children; reducing illicit financial and arms flows; strengthening recovery and return of stolen assets; combating all forms of organized crime; and reducing corruption.  In its continuing efforts to analyse current trends in organized crime  his office had recently launched a new research initiative on wildlife crime.  Noting the active engagement of civil society and governments in the debate on illicit drugs  he commended Khaled Abdel-Rahman Shamaa of Egypt  Chair of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND)  for facilitating “open  inclusive  and informed discussions” that had taken place at high-level sessions.  In order to rebalance the international policy on drugs by increasing the focus on economic  social and cultural measures  he went on  his office was supporting countries to scale up services and build capacities.  There remained serious gaps in service provision  with only one in six problem drug users accessing drug dependence treatment services each year. A public health response should also consider alternatives to penalization and incarceration of people who use drugs.  “The focus of law enforcement efforts should be on the real criminals  the drug lords involved in the supply of narcotic substances ” he stressed. Promoting alternative livelihoods  he added  was essential to achieving sustainable reductions in illicit crop cultivation.  The international community must strive to address all aspects of supply and demand  through balanced  integrated  comprehensive  and coordinated global action.  Such actions must consider countries with weak public health sectors that may be unable to cope with the social and health consequences of drug use.  It was also vital to grapple with record levels of opium and poppy cultivation and heroin production in Afghanistan  which was undermining that country’s development and affecting the region and beyond.  “What we cannot afford to do is work in silos ” he concluded. KHALED ABDEL-RAHMAN SHAMAA  Chair of the fifty-seventh session of the CND  described the world drug problem as a serious threat to public health  safety and well-being of humanity  in particular young people.  He then introduced a note by the Secretary-General transmitting the report on the Outcome of the high-level review by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs at its fifty-seventh session of the implementation by Member States of the Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem (document A/69/87-E/2014/80).  Member States recognized that “many challenges of the world drug problem have persisted  and new ones have emerged in some parts of the world ” he said.  In that regard  he underlined that the preparation process had been very active and intensive  resulting in a document which enjoyed global ownership and provided a common starting point in preparing for the 2016 special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem (UNDOC resolution 57/5).  Updating the Committee on steps taken in implementing resolution 57/5  he said the Commission had created a website (www.ungass2016.org)  to enable a global  transparent dialogue and to act as a resource hub for Member States.  In addition  inter-sessional meetings were being held  aimed at enabling the Commission to formulate “recommendations on the preparations for the possible outcomes of and organizational matters relating to that special session”. In conclusion  he emphasized that the world drug problem was truly a global challenge  requiring a global response.  Stressing the importance of collectively gained experience on the ground  at national and regional levels  he said “it is our joint responsibility to use the tools and valuable resources” available to respond to challenges in an effective way. General Debate E. COURTENAY RATTRAY (Jamaica)  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  commended UNODC for its work in guiding  developing and supporting the execution of key policies and strategies by Member States.  He urged Member States and other organizations to continue to provide voluntary contributions on the basis of earmarking.  He also pointed out that crime prevention and criminal justice were integral elements in any quest for sustainable development.  For its part  CARICOM members had adopted last year a crime and security strategy that contained key goals  such as strengthening resilience to cybercrime  modernizing correctional services and increasing trans-border intelligence. Lamenting that the region was at risk from the influence of transnational organized crime  he was pleased to be partnering with UNODC in the execution of the 2014-2016 regional programme in support of the CARICOM crime and security strategy.  In conclusion  he said that the 2016 special session presented an opportunity for all Member States and relevant stakeholders to assess and address the status of the world’s drug problem  as well as being an occasion to re-evaluate strategies  consider approaches  and examine best practices. CHARLOTTE OMOY MALENGA (Democratic Republic of the Congo)  speaking on behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  said challenges  such as poverty  unemployment  inadequate justice systems and high HIV rates  were affecting crime prevention in the region.  Illicit trafficking had been identified as the major crime to which countries’ responses were inadequate due to the lack of platforms for sharing information and intelligence.  Given that criminal activities were increasingly transcending national borders  she said crime prevention depended on regional and global cooperation. To address some of those concerns  one regional programme focused on countering illicit trafficking and organized crime  criminal justice and improving drug abuse prevention  treatment and care.  The programme aimed at strengthening both national and regional efforts through data collection and analysis  legislative assistance and capacity building.  HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia)  speaking on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  said unfortunately advances in technology and transportation had resulted in enabling and diversifying transnational crime.  For ASEAN members  regional cooperation on that subject took place within the framework of inter-ministerial meetings  with a recent meeting identifying various priority areas  including terrorism  trafficking  sea piracy  and arms smuggling. Transnational crime  he added  recognized no boundaries  and cooperation beyond ASEAN was necessary.  His organization would continue to work with partners such as China  Japan  and the Republic of Korea.  Alarmed at the recent spate of terrorist attacks around the world  he said ASEAN had adopted preventive measures to deal with those threats  including exchanging information and strengthening seaport  border and air controls.  Even though the region comprised of countries that varied in social and economic development  a drug–free ASEAN by 2015 was not a lofty goal given the high level support and cooperation. VALENTIN RYBAKOV (Belarus)  speaking on behalf of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)  said that recent years had shown an alarming increase in transnational violations such as the circulation of weapons.  Terrorist groups were actively making use of new forms of weapons technology.  A further challenge was the use of information and communication for illegal purposes.  Combating corruption was impossible without measures taken on a national scale with multilateral initiatives. This year  Belarus had undertaken a number of initiatives  including organizing events with UNDOC for the first World Day against Trafficking in Persons.  Further  CIS members have been cooperating on various programmes.  Lauding the Secretary-General’s reports on the world drug problem and on UNDOC  he said Commonwealth members believed there was a need for even more active participation by UNODC in technical cooperation between countries. THOMAS MAYR-HARTING  Head of the European Union Delegation  said transnational organized crime and corruption continued to pose serious threats to the welfare of citizens and peace and security worldwide.  Organized crime hindered sustainable development and legitimate economic activity  and undermined democratic governance  and the rule of law and security  he said; transnational crime must be tackled in a holistic fashion at the national  regional and international levels.  That was why the European Union reaffirmed the importance of United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) and its protocols  and had proposed the establishment of a strong and effective review mechanism for its implementation.  To tackle the related issue of arms trafficking  the Union had adopted a new strategy to better control the licit weapons trade and reduce their diversion into criminal hands  he said. Corruption also threatened the integrity of governments and administrations  he continued  noting the Union’s commitment to further promote the ratification and implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption.  On drug-related challenges  he recalled that the European Union drug strategy had provided a political framework and priorities for drug policies for the period of 2013 to 2020  which had contributed to regional and global discussions on related matters. SEBASTIANO CARDI (Italy) reiterated his country’s commitment to strengthening international cooperation mechanisms to fight organized crime and illicit drug trafficking  and to promote fair and effective criminal justice systems.  Mentioning Italy’s regular promotion of the United Nations General Assembly resolution on that matter  he said among the main objectives were to build consensus on the fight against transnational organized crime  and to promote the universal implementation of United Nations instruments.  WILLIAM BROWNFIELD (United States) said an unprecedented number of Member States had agreed  through international conventions  to establish a common framework of commitments against dangerous drugs.  Narcotics posed stubborn and complex challenges  he said  stressing that drug addiction deeply affected families  and corruption weakened the rule of law and democratic institutions.  Conventions were pioneering efforts as well as acknowledging the principle that no State could protect its people by working alone.  Confronting international crime must not be the exclusive responsibility of law enforcement  but also that of Member States  relevant United Nations agencies and civil society groups. “These are global issues that require global responses ” he said  stressing the importance of collective efforts in learning from each other.    EVGENY T. ZAGAYNOV (Russian Federation)  aligning his delegation with the statement delivered on behalf of the CIS  said that it was vital to counteract transnational organized crime  illegal circulation of arms and weapons  human trafficking and cybercrime.  His country supported the strengthening and universalization of United Nations treaties on those issues  and welcomed the global plan of action to combat human trafficking.  His delegation was particularly concerned about the problem of illegal trading in human organs.  The international community must make active efforts to eliminate gaps in cooperation and must strengthen international legal frameworks.  The production and circulation of Afghan drugs and the growing threat of synthetic drugs were matters of great worry.  The Russian Federation expected fruitful and substantive discussions at the upcoming Thirteenth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in Doha. RODOLFO REYES RODRÍGUEZ (Cuba) said that no country was in a position to combat transnational crime on its own.  An international economic order that was fair and equitable was essential to solve that global problem  he said  noting that Cuba rejected unilateral action.  The illicit drug trade was an extremely complex and multifaceted challenge that undermined development and public policy.  In Cuba  rehabilitation and social inclusion for the treatment of drug consumers was helping them overcome addiction.  Cuba was also meeting all its international commitments and had a good record in fighting terrorism  money laundering  piracy and trafficking people and drugs.  The United States had promoted illegal and unsafe migration of Cuban citizens  he said  noting that three Cuban fighters of terrorism were being illegally detained in that country.  Those people should be freed  he stated  noting that Cuba had never been used and would never be used as a place to organize terrorist activities. MAYANK JOSHI (India) said the increase in new illicit trade in psychoactive substances and in cyber-technologies posed serious challenges in the attempts to reduce drug supply and demand.  A robust  international control system was required for facilitating the legal trade while avoiding their diversion into illicit markets  he added.  Mentioning terrorism  cybercrime and trafficking  he called on the international community to contribute and help with financial and technical assistance in capacity building  technology- and information-sharing to fight and prevent all forms of crime. NAOTO HISAJIMA (Japan) said combatting human trafficking was a priority and was being addressed through prevention  prosecution  protection and partnership.  In addition  technical assistance projects were being implemented in Southeast Asia.  Turning to illicit drugs  especially synthetic drugs  he called for further international cooperation and information sharing.  On the issue of cybercrime  he said his delegation valued bolstering national capacities and advancing global cooperation based on existing international frameworks.  NADIA ALEXANDRA KALB (Austria) welcomed the Commission Chair’s commitment to involve civil society and the United Nations family  and to ensure an inclusive preparatory process.  Believing that more efforts were needed to fully implement commitments and targets aimed at countering the world drug problem  she welcomed the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem geared towards creating political momentum.  She said the event would be an opportunity to address the challenge as a common and shared responsibility  in a multilateral setting  through an integrated  balanced  and comprehensive approach.   JAKRIT RUANGKAJORN (Thailand) said crime prevention  rule of law  good governance  and sustainable development were mutually reinforcing.  The country attached great importance to a rights-based approach in the criminal justice system  and recognized a link between crime prevention and rights of the child.  Turning to gender-specific approaches in criminal justice  he added that discussions were ongoing to effectively prevent  investigate  prosecute  and punish gender-related killings of women and girls.  He also reaffirmed his commitment in sharing best practices and the implementation of alternative methods to address the problem of illicit drug cultivation.        MONIA ALSALEH (Syria) said human trafficking had never been a problem in her country until recently  when terrorist groups and mercenaries had crossed over its ineffectively controlled borders.  She said those groups had infiltrated Syrian borders from neighbouring countries  and were involved in human trafficking  money laundering  smuggling and theft of cultural properties and other treasures.  Investigations by Syrian authorities and a report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) found that many Syrians in refugee camps had been forced to sell their organs to illegal entities  and had been subjected to human trafficking.  In conclusion  she drew attention to the situation of Syrian people living in refugee camps  which required an immediate plan of action to protect them from those and other crimes. LIANG HENG (China) said that the authority of the existing drug control system should be maintained and fully utilized.  His country hoped that the 2015 Congress would come up with recommendations to further bolster international cooperation in tracking and recovering illicit assets  and in tackling cybercrime and other emerging forms of crime such as those involving cultural property.  In 2014  China had undertaken a series of major initiatives to combat corruption and improve governance.  The focus was on building the rule of law  improving the criminal justice system  and advancing the development of crime prevention and criminal justice.  Due to the cooperation between China and the countries concerned  a large number of cross-border drug trafficking gangs had been rooted out. MARÍA CLARISA GOLDRICK (Nicaragua) said her government had been working hard to combat narcotic drugs and transnational crime  offences that undermined society’s stability.  Noting that Nicaragua was one of the safest countries in the Latin American and Caribbean region  she said her country strongly believed in the importance of a Central America free of crime and drugs.  Mentioning her country’s hard work in ensuring peaceful  safe living standards  she stressed the important role Nicaraguan citizens played in tackling organized crime and drug problems  despite limited international aid.  In closing  she thanked the international community for their cooperation in fighting against drug trafficking. BRYAN YIP (Singapore) said that “even when I speak  a victim of drug abuse is fighting a battle to stay alive  and once every three minutes  the fight is lost”.  Financial difficulties and strained family relationships were also repercussions of a drug abuser’s habit  he added.  In response to another delegation’s position on the death penalty and drugs  he said that its application was a criminal justice matter for the competent authorities of individual States to decide based on their national circumstances.  At the national level  he added  the drug problem was met through preventative education  upstream intervention for young  first-time drug abusers  effective rehabilitation and strong enforcement and detection.  ANTONIO DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil) said fighting transnational organized crime required the international community’s concerted efforts and enhanced cooperation.  His country expected the 2015 Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to fully recognize the mutually reinforcing relationships between sustainable development and justice for all.  Supporting efficient collaboration between New York  Vienna  and Doha  Brazil invited Member States to work together on formatting the post-2015 development agenda to contribute to crime prevention and criminal justice.  Underlining cybercrime as a critical issue for the twenty-first century  Brazil was deeply concerned about the fluid nature of cyberspace and the lack of clear  multilateral governance guidelines for the Internet.  In that regard  Brazil welcomed the Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime by UNODC  which provided a detailed and broad analysis of the issue. In conclusion  Brazil recognized drug use as a public health problem  and reaffirmed its commitment to contribute to the debate in all its aspects. GHOLAMHOSSEIN DEHGHANI (Iran) said the world’s largest  illicit  opium-producing hub in Afghanistan was on the eastern border of Iran  which was a major impediment in the transit route of the illicit drug trade to the West. To address the problem  Iran had spent millions of dollars on border control.  Another rising challenge was the increasing illegal use of maritime routes for trafficking  he said  noting that more sophisticated equipment and investments were needed in combating the scourge.  The failure to fulfil the principle of shared responsibility for containing drug problems at the point of origin  was causing an increase in drug cultivation and production.  He  then  asked for the international community to adopt and implement effective decisions that supported alternative livelihood plans in Afghanistan. YANERIT MORGAN (Mexico) said illicit drugs affected the whole world  generating violence  damaging the health of young people  and destroying the social fabric of society.  Stressing that current policies had not proved effective in tackling the problem  she said organized crime had spread  requiring an urgent international response.  Her country was committed to tackling the issue by applying coordinated policies aimed at encouraging prevention  reducing the social violence associated with narcotic drugs  and strengthening international cooperation.  Further  she said the 2016 special session would be an excellent starting point to assess a new approach with a long-term vision. OMAR HILALE (Morocco) said drug control deserved special attention because of its effects on sustainable development  making it of interest to all nations.  National administrations needed to integrate law enforcement as a prerequisite  as well as honour international commitments.  At the national level  programmes had been developed to reform the judicial system  foster good governance  reform legislation  and combat money laundering and terrorism.  Those programmes were part of economic  political  and social reform programmes  launched a decade ago to promote and protect its citizens’ human rights  he added.  Strategically positioned at the border between Africa and Europe  Morocco had been contributing in the spirit of partnership  and shared responsibility to find effective responses to the drug and crime problems. KAMEL CHIR (Algeria) stated that the international community must strive to achieve universal participation in the Convention against Transnational Crime.  At the African level  Algeria welcomed the mobilization of leaders to cope with challenges that constrained several States by diverting significant resources from human development budgets to strengthening their public safety.  For its part  Algeria was implementing a programme aimed at reducing the consumption of drugs  through awareness campaigns that targeted young people  and the treatment of drug addicts  and by establishing a law on the prevention of the use and trafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. MIGUEL CAMILO RUIZ (Colombia) stressed the importance of the current session in strengthening commitments.  To make progress  he said  transparent and innovative policies and alternative approaches must be created.  Colombia stressed the need for the General Assembly to move forward towards its 2016 special session on drugs  saying it was imperative to include all stakeholders and ensure high-quality discussions.  In conclusion  he called on countries to renew their commitments and underlined the importance of producing an action-oriented outcome document in response to the international drug problem.  HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia) said acts of terrorism and transnational crime were global concerns that needed to be addressed as they had detrimental effects on social  political  and economic development.  In combating transnational crime  it was crucial to ensure collective cooperation among countries through exchanges of information  capacity-building  mutual legal assistance  and joint investigations  he added.  Turning to terrorism  he was perturbed by extremists committing acts of terror in the name of religion  and recognized effective international efforts in fighting that scourge.  On drugs  he said the major related problems were smuggling drugs into the country for local consumption; abuse of drugs by the local population; and the transit of drugs through Malaysia for third countries.  He  then  called for continued efforts in combating those crimes in a balanced and holistic manner through national  regional  and multilateral efforts  while maintaining respect for differences in the policies and situations of all countries. MAHMADAMIN MAHMADAMINOV (Tajikistan) said the severity and magnitude of the problems associated with illicit drug production and trafficking  threatened international stability and security.  Calling on the international community to coordinate measures aimed at reducing drug demand and supply  he said the establishment of a global  multi-level system of international cooperation  with the United Nations as a coordinating centre  would be an effective response.  For its part  Tajikistan intended to strengthen and expand cooperation with other Member States  and international and regional organizations  in the implementation of international conventions on narcotic drugs to tackle the world drug problem. DIA A. A. ABUBAKER (Libya) said transnational crimes were a challenge to all national governments  as terrorist groups were able to contact one another.  Technical assistance to combat terrorism and crime was needed  especially in developing countries  to encourage the implementation of international recommendations. “Drugs are a threat to humanity ” he said  “not limited to one specific people.”  Getting rid of plantations was seen as an international and multilateral effort.  At the national level  legislation had been adopted to criminalize selling drugs  which was viewed as a “weapon of mass destruction”.  IBRAHIM FAISAL AL-DAI (Kuwait) called on UNODC for effective measures to combat crime.  Turning to corruption  he said that national initiatives had been adopted to combat money laundering.  In adherence to international conventions on drugs  he said that a forum had been held annually to discuss that issue.  In addition  social activities had been organized to raise awareness among youth  he said  pointing out that drug crimes and deaths related to drugs had dropped. SAHEBZADA AHMED KHAN (Pakistan) stated that the twin phenomenon of drug abuse and narcotics smuggling jeopardized social stability and economic well-being in many ways.  As a transit state in the world’s most prolific poppy-cultivating region  Pakistan was especially vulnerable to its destructive impact.  His country’s counter-narcotics agencies maintained a robust level of operational preparedness  and worked in close cooperation with international agencies and regional countries.  The world’s drug problem  however  could not be controlled in a sustainable manner without paying adequate attention to the demand side of the international drug market.  In closing  he warned that the recent trend of legalization of narcotic drugs in some countries could further increase the demand for drugs. FODÉ SECK (Senegal) said organized transnational crime affected the stability and growth of States as it was dangerously linked with illicit activities  such as trafficking  terrorism  and money laundering.  West Africa was exposed to illicit trafficking  which was the main source of instability in the region.  Noting that more than 50 tons of cocaine was smuggled through West Africa  Senegal was working efficiently both in regional and international conferences to counter drug trafficking problems  which needed a global coordinated response.  In conclusion  he invited the international community to strengthen information- and capacity-sharing systems  promoting security system and justice reforms. FIRDOSA ABDULKADIR IBRAHIM (Ethiopia) said that the effects of human and drug trafficking  corruption  terrorism  and transnational organized crimes  had been felt by each state in one way or another and in varying degrees.  For its part  Ethiopia recognized the relevance of international cooperation in the fight against transnational organized crimes.  Turning to human trafficking  she noted that the Horn of Africa was the most affected area.  Since poverty  unemployment and lack of socio-economic opportunities were contributing factors  the Government had focused its economic growth and development policies on poverty eradication  creating job opportunities  democratization and good governance.  On corruption  she identified it as a serious barrier to effective resource mobilization  diverting resources away from activities  and strong political will and commitment to leadership was required to address it. GUSTAVO MEZA-CUADRA (Peru) said  because drugs had undermined development  anti-drug policies needed to be based on supply control  as well as reducing the demand and producing alternatives for farmers.  Transitioning from illegal crops to alternative options required international cooperation  he added  asking for an increased and sustained budget aimed to make that happen.  At the national level  17.5 per cent of illicit coca plantations had been eradicated in 2013.  In addition  opportunities for better education and health services were provided to the population affected.  The post-eradication plan  he added  sought ways for alternative forms of development  social inclusion  and caring for the environment.  The illicit drug problem could not be tackled by a State alone  he said  but only through collective and transparent interventions.  THANT SIN (Myanmar) said it was discouraging to learn from this year’s report that illicit opium poppy cultivation in 2013 was the highest level since 2008.  Serious supply-reduction efforts must be complemented by equally serious demand-reduction policies.  Successive Governments in Myanmar had adopted a series of practical measures to eradicate drugs in the country  by strengthening enforcement and providing alternative livelihoods to farmers to encourage them to end their dependence on opium poppy cultivation.  In 2013 alone  a total of 4 928 cases of drugs were exposed and narcotic drugs  including 2 350 kgs of raw opium; 238 kgs of heroin; and 10.18 million stimulant tablets were seized.  Further  Myanmar was working closely with fellow ASEAN members to reach the common goal of making the region free of drugs by 2015. LARYSA BELSKAYA (Belarus)  speaking on behalf of the CIS  said the 2015 Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice would be a significant opportunity to exchange views on combatting transnational organized crime and trafficking.  Stressing the importance of combatting corruption within national borders and beyond  as criminality became increasingly globalized  she said national and multilateral efforts must be combined to be effective.  Noting that the issue of human trafficking was a priority for Belarus  she added that national mechanisms should be aligned with international standards. AHMAD HASSAN AL-HAMADI (Qatar) said his country was addressing issues of transnational organized crime through multilateral and bilateral cooperation.  Crime and the global drug problem remained major challenges for the international community  violating the rule of law.  Qatar believed fighting against corruption and terrorism  and backing criminal justice systems must be the priority  as those were the essential elements of sustainable development.  Further  the Government was working closely with the United Nations and had conducted regional workshops to build the capacity to combat those challenges.  In conclusion  he said  in hosting the Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice next year  his Government would bring national  regional  and international actors together to fight against drug trafficking and terrorism. XAVIER LASSO MENDOZA (Ecuador) said the drug problem needed to be tackled comprehensively  as the current international strategy had not produced the results desired.  The consumption of drugs had a negative impact on the country and on the community  he noted  as it destroyed the social fabric.  Despite not being a producing country  but a transit one  Ecuador suffered from high social costs due to drugs  including money laundering and related deaths.  He  then  called on drug-consuming countries to step up their efforts to combat the illicit trade  as well as on the international community to elaborate a fairer strategy  aimed at preventing drug use and focusing on health.  In conclusion  he said that Bolivia had the right to use the coca leaf for chewing  as it was a cultural practice  which must be respected.  BERNARDITO CLEOPAS AUZA  Permanent Observer of the Holy See  said the illicit drug problem had become a multi-dimensional challenge demanding international cooperation towards reaching and implementing an internationally-agreed  common strategy.  “The production and trafficking of illicit drugs obey the law of supply and demand ” he noted.  An individual afflicted with drug addiction affected the family and the community  making the family a cornerstone of prevention  treatment  rehabilitation  reintegration  and health strategies.  Turning to human trafficking  he urged greater international cooperation to consolidate the progress to date.  He also appreciated those developing countries that had provided farming families with real alternatives to cultivating drug-related crops.  JUAN MARCELO ZAMBRANA TORRELIO (Bolivia) said narcotic drugs posed a threat to the public security of all humanity  and that was why all States shared a responsibility to address it.  Among his Government’s achievements  there had been a record reduction in the coca crop  without any killings  and with the full respect for human rights  he said.  Explaining his Government’s reservation to the 1961 Convention on Narcotic Drugs  he noted that chewing coca leaves was part of Bolivia’s cultural and ancestral legacy  and that the crop was also used for medical purposes. ANDREW KIHURANI (Kenya) said that the Eastern Africa and Horn of Africa regions had witnessed an increase in the supply of illicit drugs destined for Europe and Asia; the fight against that had not been very successful.  It was imperative to change tactics and discuss a completely novel approach to dealing with those problems.  Kenya was especially concerned about the continued proliferation of small arms and light weapons in Africa.  Those weapons maimed  killed  and disrupted essential services  such as education  health  and economic activities.  The Kenyan Defence Forces  which were part of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) troops  had successfully removed Al-Shabaab from Kismayo  Somalia’s major port  which was a crucial source of funding for terrorists.  Another area in which Kenya had made commendable strides was in combatting human trafficking  with recent legislation focused on improving measures for prevention and victim protection. PETER EMUZE (Nigeria) said his country’s commitment to fight illicit drug cultivation  trade  and use  was done through funding  legislative reviews  and enhanced personnel training.  However  the emergence of clandestine laboratories for the production of methamphetamine had presented a new challenge  especially in light of the growing problem associated with the diversion of raw materials used in illegal drug factories.  An effective way to combat illicit drug cartels in West Africa was to prevent the diversion of chemicals used in drug production  he said  and  thus  the activities of licensed importers of those chemicals were being closely monitored.  A major focus was also on capacity building  involving training and retraining officers  and on global collaboration with other nations. OSAMA ABDELKHALEK MAHMOUD (Egypt) said it was vital to provide UNODC with adequate  predictable  and stable resources  including additional regular budget resources to enable it to fulfil its mandate.  Egypt welcomed the adoption of the European Union Parliament resolution on asset recovery by Arab countries in transition.  The resolution stressed that the return of stolen assets to the countries of origin was a moral and legal imperative.  Combating trafficking in cultural property was a top priority for his country.  Drugs were another major concern  not only threatening national security but also the lives of many young Egyptians.  Egypt stood ready to engage actively in the preparations for the special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem. ERVIN NINA (Albania) said that trafficking in persons was the fastest growing activity in the world  and was a violation of the human rights of its victims.  Prevention  prosecution of the perpetrators  and protection of the victims were needed.  At the national level  measures had been taken to address that issue  including better access to the law for victims of domestic violence.  Since human trafficking was a transnational activity  he added  mobile technology was being used to raise awareness  increase identification of potential victims  as well as to provide quick access to assistance.  Turning to drugs and organized crime  he said that over 2 000 crops of illegally produced cannabis had been destroyed  erasing Albania from the list of countries of origin for that drug. Right of reply Exercising the right of reply  a representative of Ukraine said the delegation of Belarus had delivered a statement in its capacity as the president of the Commonwealth of Independent States.  He pointed out that his delegation had disassociated itself from the statement delivered by Belarus  and was in alignment with the statement delivered by the European Union.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-09,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaspd556.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. In a meeting dominated by harsh words and displays of raw emotion  the Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) heard petitioners on Western Sahara emphasize the urgency of international action to settle the territory’s long-running quest for self-determination and also bolster regional and global security. As petitioners on behalf of Morocco and Algeria blamed each other for the deadlock  Saharan activists spoke of the daily toil and turmoil that took a heavy toll on the people each day. Several petitioners spoke of Morocco’s constitutional and legal reforms as a reference point for a settlement in Western Sahara  as well as for region-wide change  while others cautioned against letting Morocco use such praise to skirt its international obligations. As other petitioners accused Algeria and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro (Frente Polisario) of stifling dissent in the Tindouf camps  one activist spoke of how young Saharans were attempting to improve their conditions under persistent danger to their lives  even outside the glare of international attention. One petitioner who had escaped from a Tindouf camp recounted how she was campaigning to improve the situation of current residents  while a Saharan college student in the United States blamed United Nations inaction for the death of his uncle under harsh conditions in a camp. Yet  another petitioner explained that he had made a point of calling the people there “detainees” and not refugees  and insisted that they be allowed to return freely to their homeland of Morocco. Activists and campaigners from outside the region made emotion-laden appeals for concerted international action  including one petitioner who said that the Saharan people could not bear to see their children play with rusty cans or survive on humanitarian rations while their homeland was full of resources. A law enforcement expert from the United Kingdom detailed how criminals  aided and abetted by Frente Polisario and Algerian officials  siphoned off international food aid and risked further destabilizing the wider region. A petitioner from the United States explained how Morocco was exploiting the natural resources of Western Sahara  often in collusion with companies from the developed world. Another said that the conflict had lasted too long  but argued that was no excuse for the United Nations to avoid its responsibility to give the people of Western Sahara the right to self-determination. The Committee will meet at 3 p.m. on Friday  10 October  to continue hearing from petitioners and to hold discussions on other items on the decolonization agenda. Background The Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) met this afternoon on decolonization issues  for which it was scheduled to continue hearing petitioners from Western Sahara. For further background  see Press Releases GA/SPD/554 of 7 October and GA/SPD/555 of 8 October. Petitioners for Western Sahara MOHAMMAD ZIYAD AL JABARI of the Palestinian Moroccan Friendship Society said he was perplexed by ongoing discussions because Morocco was making progress in many areas  including human rights  in coordination with regional and international organizations.  The political reforms witnessed in Morocco over the past 15 and efforts to ensure social and economic equity have been hailed as positive steps to resolve the question of Western Sahara.  Just as the European Union welcomed Scotland’s decision to remain in the United Kingdom  Morocco was hoping to resolve what he called a “manufactured crisis” for the benefit of the people of Western Sahara and the region at large. PAUL BUNDUKU-LATHA of the Observatory of Mediation and Conflict Management in Africa said that autonomy was a principle of self-determination according to United Nations texts.  The right to self-determination  although limited by the older principle of territorial integrity  could be expressed through referenda.  The results of such polling  however  could lead to upheavals  disputes and even civil war  which was why the United Nations seemed to prefer negotiated political settlements.  With regard to Western Sahara  the Organization had concluded that a referendum was not possible there.  Autonomy was the ideal means to overcome the suffering in the Tindouf camps  and to bring peace to the Maghreb region as a whole. FERNANDO CALLE HAYN said Morocco’s constitutional reforms provided a reference for the wider Arab world  as they built inclusiveness and openness in a broad range of areas.  There was acknowledgement of rule of law  international human rights standards  gender equality and constitutional safeguards.  Echoing former Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar  he said autonomy was the best hope for Western Sahara  as a fair and genuine settlement within the framework of United Nations resolutions. TANYA WARBURG  Freedom For All  called for the registration and census of the people living in Tindouf.  The increasing instability across the region threatened the safety of the Saharan refugees  while the lack of opportunity  and the corruption and brutality of Frente Polisario encouraged the radicalization of the youth and their association with terrorists.  While Morocco had strengthened its implementation of human rights reforms and worked with the United Nations  Algeria had denied the entry visas of five international non-governmental organizations focused on human rights.  Freedom For All believed that the Moroccan Plan for autonomy would deliver Saharan self-determination and provide a lasting resolution to the conflict. VANESSA RAMOS of the American Association of Jurists said that Western Sahara was subject to United Nations resolutions on decolonization and the people there had the inalienable right to self-determination.  Resolution 1514 (XV) compelled Member States to facilitate the process of decolonization  and called on the General Assembly to take up its responsibility where it had not been fully met.  Western Sahara had been occupied since 1975 and was divided by a militarized wall while natural resources were extracted illegally through agreements by Morocco  other countries and transnational companies.  This was all a violation of the rights of Western Saharans.  She called for a transparent referendum to be held under the supervision of the United Nations  and for countries to refrain from violating the sovereignty of Western Sahara by exploiting its resources.  She expressed hope that a settlement would be reached that allowed Morocco and Western Sahara to exist in peace and fraternity. VERONICA JANE BAHAIJOUB expressed concerns over the humanitarian situation in the Tindouf camps and the growing threat of terrorism in North Africa.  The escalated instability in the camps had made the youths prime targets for terrorist groups.  She recalled the requests made by several international institutions to conduct a census of the camp population.  In stark contrast to that situation  Saharans living in Western Sahara were allowed to travel abroad freely.  Refugees should be given travel documents and have the right to choose where they live.  She stated that the only solution for the refugee camps was the Moroccan proposal for autonomy. SYDNEY S. ASSOR  Surrey Three Faiths Forum  drew attention to the situation in the Tindouf camps  where more than 90 000 “detainees” had been held for decades.  He explained that he had made a point of calling them “detainees” and not refugees  and insisted that they be allowed to return freely to their homeland of Morocco. STÉPHANE DOMINGUES RODRIGUES said the Security Council had again underscored the worrisome situation in the Tindouf camps  despite the provision of humanitarian assistance by the European Union and other donors.  The question remained as to why that assistance had not improved conditions there.  It was now clear that much of it had been diverted  something that had been the subject of speculation for several years.  A report of the European office shed light on the wide scale of the diversion of aid  which he maintained was organized by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro (Frente Polisario).  He stressed that such aid should be monitored and properly distributed. AHMED LAKHRIF  a Saharan activist  said he and his colleagues were working to integrate the territory with its mother country  Morocco  with the backing of the people.  Frente Polisario  he said  could not claim that kind of legitimate backing for the course it was advocating.  It was  thus  perpetrating violence and denying the people their democratic right to express themselves.  He maintained that neither Frente Polisario nor Algeria represented the Saharan people  and thus  the opinions expressed by their petitioners did not carry much weight. YARBA ESSALLAMI  noting that he had descended from the Saharan region of Morocco  said he wished to draw attention to crimes committed against his people who were detained in the Tindouf camps.  He deplored the shooting death of a cousin and friend perpetrated by the Algerian army at the Mauritanian-Algerian border.  In an attempt to justify that crime  the Algerian authorities claimed the two men were smuggling fuel  which was untrue.  Every uprising contained murders.  Human rights organizations should hold accountable those who had committed that crime.  Young Saharans detained in Algeria continued their uprising  which was the beginning of a revolution that would liberate them from the hegemony of Algeria and Frente Polisario.  Concluding  he appealed to the United Nations to try the killers of his cousin and friend. FALA BOUSSOLA of Annahda des Droits des Femmes a Laayoune said that  while she enjoyed the rights and dignity offered to her by Morocco  the same could not be said of members of her community that resided in Algerian camps.  Women were easy targets as they could not complain and were separated from their children on various pretexts  she said  criticizing the “scandalous” silence of some organizations benefitting financially from the situation.  The fact that they condone inhumane acts must be exposed before the international community.  As a defender of human rights and specifically women’s rights  she said she had come to “raise the alarm” for the benefit of those hapless people. RACHID TAMEK said there must be effective counter-terrorism  which could only be realized through integrated and complete cooperation.  The borders between Morocco and Algeria were secure  but other borders of Algeria were less so and were vulnerable to drug smugglers and other criminals.  He deplored the intransigence of the Algerian authorities  which perpetuated the activities of terrorists.  Those responsible must be held accountable.  For the past 40 years  Algeria spent more than $250 billion to separate the Sahara from Morocco  depriving the Saharan people of their country’s wealth.  Saharans were ready for self-determination  which would be the main solution to the long-standing problem. MAHJOUBA DAOUDI  a Saharan researcher  said petitioners carrying the separatist banner in Western Sahara were in reality Algerians.  Why were the people living in the Tindouf camp not available to express their views before the United Nations?  The 2013 United States State Department report and the five leading international human rights organizations had cited restrictions placed by Algeria on its people  as well as on those seeking to study their plight.  “Get your own house in order before asking your neighbours to do the same ” she said. ERIK JENSEN  former Head of Mission and Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Western Sahara  said that the census undertaken by Spain 40 years ago was interesting as an historical document  but nothing more.  Figures for the camps still awaited assessment by UNHCR.  The breakthrough 20 years ago proved that the plan devised by the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) at the time could not deliver an outcome that was acceptable to both sides.  Ten years ago  it was clear that there was no further alternative plans.  In order for negotiations to work  those needed to be realistic  but with sufficient flexibility at the outset in order for aspirations to be expressed. OMAR DKHIL said that Algeria always said it had no claims to Western Sahara  but it was Algeria and not Frente Polisario that had access to the international forums.  If Algeria had no claims to Western Sahara  then it did not make sense for the Algerian President to take part in talks to partition the territory.  Suggesting partition did not acknowledge self-determination for Western Saharans.  That question was between Morocco and the Saharan people and was not a matter for Algeria to determine.  If the decision had been left to those in the camps and Morocco  it would have been solved long ago.  Instead  the Algerian authorities were hiding behind Frente Polisario to cause trouble. MAGHLAHA DLIMI  a former inmate from the Tindouf camps  described the difficult conditions she had endured there.  The propaganda campaign of those responsible must not be allowed to mislead the world.  She and her compatriots who had fled those camps always denounced the continuing systematic violations of human rights in flagrant breach of all international conventions.  She urged the United Nations and the international community to intervene to end the detention of the people in the Tindouf camps.  Experts should investigate and highlight the abuses more vigorously in order to ensure respect for the victims’ rights. BRAIGUNA LAAROUSSI said that  without a civil society that was organized and strong  democracy could never prosper  because it always needed to be protected  defended and guided towards the right path.  It was fortunate for Morocco that for a number of years there had been an extended network of governmental and non-governmental organizations to safeguard the Kingdom and support the democracy to which Morocco was committed.  She was confident that the new non-governmental organizations  established since the new Constitution of 2011  had achieved a high level of discipline  intellectual integrity and a sense of sacrifice.  Moroccans were proud of the vital role they were exerting to establish genuine democratic practices in the Kingdom. ARAABOUB ABHAI said a new generation of people had been trying to improve their situation in the Tindouf camp under great personal risk from Frente Polisario.  The young people was striving to end the nepotism and rotating leadership prevailing in the camps.  That they should come under threats from those running the camps was understandable  but what was surprising was the United Nations’ refusal to engage with the group. JENNY EUGENIA MARKETOU  Western Sahara Resource Watch  called attention to the problems of fishery and phosphate mineral rock reserve in occupied Western Sahara  and asked the United Nations to assume oversight of resource development there.  The development of resources from the territory enriched Morocco and served as a pretext for the continued Moroccan annexation of Western Sahara.  She recalled two undeniable facts :  the International Court of Justice had advised that Morocco had no territorial claim on Western Sahara and that the Saharan people were the territory’s original inhabitants.  She also drew attention to the issue of the petroleum exploration in the coastal waters of Western Sahara.  The Saharan people had clearly voiced their opposition to that out of fear petroleum would not be available to them in the future and that the economic activity from oil production would entrench an illegal occupation.  She asked the Committee to take note of the problem and condemn that activity. JANET LENZ  Not Forgotten International  Inc.  said that the Saharan people could not bear to see their children play with rusty cans  or survive on humanitarian rations  or watch them wasting educational opportunities while their homeland was full of resources.  She implored the Committee to do the right thing and give the Saharan people the right to decide of their own future and that of their children. ANNA MARIA STAME CERVONE  President of Centrist Democratic Women International  said that women in the camps faced human rights violations daily.  The camps were totally isolated from the international community  and many women  particularly widows  suffered sexual violence when they went to collect their rationed food aid.  She called on the United Nations and the international community to intervene to end the torment of those detained women in the Tindouf camps.  They and their children must be given the chance for a more dignified life that respected their rights to freedom of expression  movement and the voluntary return to their country of origin.  It was the shared responsibility of Algeria and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to protect them. LUC DELESTRE  speaking on behalf of Comite d’Establissement Regional SNCF de Normandie  accused the Moroccan Government of committing brutality in Western Sahara.  History reminded the world that chaos led to worse things  he said.  Holding the long-promised referendum  therefore  was vital to break the “wall of silence”.  His organization in France supported activities that instilled hope among the Saharans about their future.  Until peace was found  his organization would continue to demolish the “wall of shame” constructed by Morocco.  The world needed to hear that message of peace and do all it could to advance it. AANDALLAH SALMA  coordinator for families of Saharan victims killed in the Tindouf camps  said that  on 5 January  a dozen persons had gone to visit their families and get supplies.  They were then shot at with live bullets by Algerian soldiers hidden behind the dunes.  Some were hit and killed  as seen by witnesses who panicked and fled the scene so as not to meet the same fate.  The families of those killed had demanded an inquiry into what happened  but the bodies of the victims were buried without any follow-up to the requests for autopsies.  Nor had the perpetrators been brought to justice.  He demanded an investigation into that incident and the prosecution of those responsible. ROBIN KAHN read the statement of Kneita Buddah Mohammed  a Saharan woman living in Tindouf refugee camp  who was born and raised in refugee camps  where hunger  disease  thirst and heat were every-day conditions.  The “wall of shame”  separating the territories of Western Sahara occupied by Morocco and the refugee camps in the south-east corner of Algeria  divided both her family and country.  She recalled that women were the foundation of society and  with their own hands  they built the refugee camps  sewed tents and clothes  and carried water.  She asked the international community to end that painful situation and find a political solution. CYNTHIA BASINET  singer and actress  said that she had been petitioning on behalf of Western Sahara for more than 10 years  while many had been doing it for decades longer than that.  Ten years ago  there were no iPads  iPhones or “selfies” to distract from the issue  and yet  change still had not occurred.  She asked what could be done for the United Nations to be invested in aggregating the necessary change to “live the oath and pledge” that it had undertaken. EVA PFOSTL stated that  for the sake of regional stability  the dispute over the Western Sahara could not continue to be relegated to the status of the “forgotten conflict”.  Territorial autonomy  she said  met the fundamental right of ethnic groups to enjoy self-determination without changing international borders.  The Moroccan proposal to implement territorial autonomy and the advanced regionalization programme could create a sustainable solution to the Western Sahara conflict. MARINA CRISTINE PENTOJA highlighted the effort made by Morocco to empower the Saharan people in terms of economic  human development and job creation.  To encourage local entrepreneurship  Morocco guaranteed freedom to do business and liberty of circulation of goods and persons in the southern region.  Showcasing the company Phosboucraa  the largest employer in the Sahara  she illustrated the progress on job creation.  Regarding human rights  social protection and gender inclusion  she noted that non-discrimination and promotion of gender equality  women’s access to employment and primary education for children were showing better results in southern provinces than in other parts of the country. KIRBY GOOKIN  Western Sahara Human Rights Watch  said the people of Western Sahara  a colonial country  were the responsibility of the United Nations  as was the solution to the conflict.  He noted that the International Court of Justice had decided that a referendum for self-determination should be held.  The delay in the implementation of the decolonization process affected human rights in Western Sahara; the civil and political rights  economic rights and social and cultural rights were also systematically violated.  He concluded that the conflict had lasted too long  but that was no excuse for the United Nations to avoid its responsibility to give the people of Western Sahara the right to self-determination. KEVIN HARRIGAN  a United Kingdom law enforcement expert  highlighted how food aid intended for the Tindouf camps was being illegally diverted to places such as Mali and Mauritania.  Members of Frente Polisario and Algerians were involved in the illegal act  he said.  The World Food Programme (WFP) provided 125 000 general food rations per month  but those living there remained malnourished because criminals systematically took possession of the supplies and then siphoned off portions for illicit sale while inflating refugee numbers.  The international community must conduct a thorough investigation to prevent further destabilization in the wider region. JOSÉ MARIA GIL GARRE  Global Security Institute  said there was an undesirable situation in the region due to the erratic conduct and lack of prospect within the United Nations.  Frente Polisario was a dictatorship that was being supported by the international community.  The Saharan region was now seeing a very unstable situation  with the presence of armed groups and Jihadist terrorism.  Representatives of Algeria had made threats “in a very unsettled way”  and some of their speeches before the Fourth Committee were no less than provocative.  A group that was part of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS) was part of a group involved with Frente Polisario.  That issue must be addressed  as the door was opening up to a much worse situation  such as had been seen in Mali  Libya and Syria.  Jihadist terrorism would be the greatest cause of international instability imaginable.  The southern provinces of Morocco were already constitutionally endowed to assume territorial governance and autonomy  so now the United Nations could  once and for all  be consistent with Morocco’s proposal  which was real  serious and offered the possibility of getting rid of the spectre of instability. JAVIER A. GONZALEZ VEGA  Asturian Monitoring Centre for Human Rights in Western Sahara  said successive United Nations resolutions established various dimensions to the right of self-determination  including over natural resources  which continued to be flouted.  Morocco was exploiting the natural resources of Western Sahara without consultation with the people.  Parties that signed agreements with Morocco were equally guilty of breaches. INÉS MIRANDA NAVARROA  General Council for Spanish Advocates  said that Morocco was the occupying Power of Western Sahara and continued to alter that territory’s population.  That country employed arbitrary detentions  forced disappearances and torture.  The breach of legal order by the occupying Power included actions taken against defence attorneys.  Such trials were contrived and served to imprison activists and defenders of human rights in Western Sahara.  Legitimate actions were tried “as offences” when they should be enshrined by international legislation for the population of the occupied territories. MARÍA DOLORES TRAVIESO DARIAS  Canaria Juristas por la Paz y Derechos Humanos  said that the Saharan region was illegally occupied by Morocco.  There were many “anti-legal” elements systematically imposed on the Saharan population in its pursuit of self-determination for Western Sahara.  Additionally  the Saharan identity was being killed off.  The legal observers had denounced the arbitrary arrests of Saharans and trials without due process  as well as the dispersion of detainees across the territory of Morocco.  At the same time  Morocco continued its arbitrary policy of imposing penalties on the Saharans  such as unjust life imprisonment.  Effective action was needed to ensure compliance with international law and the protection of human rights in the region. JOSE REVERT CALABUIG  International Association of Jurists for Western Sahara  said that the international legislation of Western Sahara’s right to self-determination had been violated by Morocco’s military occupation in 1975.  That occupation had not even been recognized by the Spanish court  and was  therefore  technically still the administering Power.  Today  almost 39 years later  the Saharan people had not achieved self-determination  he said  adding that now was the moment to stop being neutral. CHRISTOPHER EDWIN BRAHAM  International Association for Strategic Studies  said his petition was on behalf of Morocco.  The Western Sahara conflict was a security threat to North Africa and the Sahel.  Citing a report to the British Parliament  he said that the Frente Polisario-controlled camps in Tindouf were a fertile ground for the recruitment of Jihadists.  Increased crime had made Tindouf a refuge for jihadists forced from northern Mali  following a crackdown there on Islamist extremists.  In 2012  another report  by CNA Corporation Strategic Studies  cited evidence that Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb had infiltrated the Tindouf camps  and that people from those camps had joined Mali-based terrorist groups.  Algeria was obliged to allow observers into Tindouf to assess the danger. MULA IHFID SID AHMED  a Saharan college student in the United States  spoke of the human rights violations perpetrated by the Moroccan regime in the occupied territory and the plunder of its natural resources in violation of international law. Citing the recent death of an uncle in a refugee camp amid severe conditions and shortage of equipment  he said he blamed the United Nations’ inaction for the tragedy.  How long would the Saharan people have to wait for a solution?  What the United Nations would allow was what would continue  he concluded. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-09,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaab4121.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. While the Organization’s financial indicators for 2014 were generally sound  the United Nations senior management official told the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) today that the regular budget’s cash position was low and under extra pressure from the emergency financing needs of the Capital Master Plan and emergency funding for the United Nations operations to control the Ebola outbreak. Yakio Takasu  Under-Secretary-General for Management  told delegates that the regular budget’s cash position  including reserves  now stood at $419 million  yet disbursements through year-end 2014 were estimated to total about $800 million.  The cash squeeze had been heightened by the use of the regular budget’s Working Capital Fund and Special Account as a temporary financing vehicle to meet the cash flow requirements of the Capital Master Plan.  The use of those accounts was authorized in April  through General Assembly resolution 68/247 B  until the Assembly could act on the Plan’s financing dilemma during the main portion of its sixty-ninth session. In addition  earlier this week the Committee approved the funding of $49.9 million for the newly created United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) through year’s end. Mr. Takasu said the final cash position of the Organization’s regular budget at the end of December would depend largely on the payments made by Member States.  Unpaid assessed contributions totalled slightly more than $1 billion in October 2014  $92 million more than the $945 million outstanding as of 1 October 2013.  [The United States was responsible for $882 million of the $1.04 billion that remained outstanding as of 2 October 2014  according to a chart Mr. Takasu presented to the Committee.]  Since that cut-off date  the United States had made a payment of $83.2 million.  The chart showed that Brazil owed $77 million; Venezuela $28 million; and 65 other Member States were responsible for $50 million. Mr. Takasu thanked the 125 Member States that had paid their regular budget assessments in full as of 2 October 2014  nine fewer than 1 October 2013 and 21 fewer than the 146 which had paid in full as of 31 December 2013.  Two Member States had made their payments since the 2 October 2014 cut-off date  bringing the number of States that had not paid their assessed contributions to the regular budget to 66. Mr. Takasu’s semi-annual snapshot of the Organization’s finances included details on the regular budget  United Nations peacekeeping operations  the international tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda  and the Capital Master Plan account.  That Plan’s account was created to manage the renovations of the world body’s New York City Headquarters. As part of his presentation  Mr. Takasu laid out four main financial indicators — assessments levied on Member States  unpaid assessments  available cash resources and the Organization’s debt to Member States.  [The Secretariat will incorporate this information into a report  which will be released for the Committee’s discussion at its 16 October 2014 meeting.] As always  the shifting demands of the Organization’s peacekeeping activities — which run from a 1 July to 30 June fiscal year — made predicting the financial outcome for peacekeeping operations more difficult  Mr. Takasu said.  In addition  assessment letters were sent out separately for each mission and issued for different periods throughout the fiscal year as they could only be issued through the individual mandate period approved by the Security Council.  “All of these factors complicate a comparison between peacekeeping operations and regular budget ” he said. Using the same 2 October 2014 cut-off date  Mr. Takasu said outstanding contributions for peacekeeping operations tallied $2.6 billion.  A total of $5.8 billion had been levied for peacekeeping operations in 2014.  That amount included $1 billion in assessments for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)  United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) that were sent out on 19 September.  Contributions received so far in 2014 tallied $5.5 billion. He expressed special gratitude to the 30 Member States which had fully paid the peacekeeping assessments due as of 2 October 2014.  He acknowledged that the unpredictable amount and timing of peacekeeping assessments could heighten the difficulty Member States encountered in keeping fully current.  Three more Member States had paid their peacekeeping assessment since 2 October 2014. Total cash available for peacekeeping operation as of 2 October 2014 was about $4.25 billion  including $3.8 billion for active missions  $310 million for closed missions and $134 million in the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund. Mr. Takasu said the Secretariat had made every effort to minimize the level of outstanding payments to Member States  which was expected to total $501 million by year’s end  compared with $513 million at the end of 2013.  As of 3 October 2014  the Organization owed $585 million to Member States for troops and formed police units.  Contingent-owned equipment claims totalled $1.3 billion  including $602 million for active missions and $86 million for closed missions.  “The Secretariat is monitoring the peacekeeping cash with a view to making payments whenever possible ” said Mr. Takasu.  “Payments are now being processed  and by tomorrow  the outstanding payments will be reduced from $1.3 billion to $815 million.” [According to a chart presented to the Committee  Ethiopia was owed the largest amount at $137 million  followed by India at $110 million  Pakistan at $109 million and Bangladesh at $108 million.] While noting the Secretary-General’s commitment to meet its obligations to Member States as quickly as the Organization’s cash situation permits  Mr. Takasu said the Organization is depending on Member States to meet their financial obligations in full and on time.  It was also depending on the prompt completion of the memorandums of understanding with troop contributors for providing equipment. Regarding the financial situation of the two international tribunals and the International Residual Mechanism  Mr. Takasu said their financial position was similar to 2013 and unpaid assessments for tribunals totalled $60 million on 2 October 2014.  That amount matched the 1 October 2013 level.  He noted that the number of Member States paying their assessed contributions for the tribunals in full was 98 as of 2 October 2014  two more than reported in 1 October 2014 of last year.  [According to a chart presented by Mr. Takasu  the United States was responsible for $29 million or the $60 million in unpaid assessments as of 2 October 2014.] Finally  Mr. Takasu outlined the financial position of the Capital Master Plan account.  Most of the $1.87 billion assessed under this special account had been received  with $500 000 still outstanding.  The account’s remaining cash balance [$33 billion as of 2 October 2013  according to a chart presented to the Committee]  would be fully used in November.  As mentioned earlier  the Assembly had authorized the use of the regular budget’s Working Capital Fund and Special Account  on an exceptional basis  to handle any financing needs of the Plan’s associated costs and secondary data centre expenditures  which totalled $154.8 million.  “Such arrangement cannot last longer before the Working Capital Fund is to be exhausted ” said Mr. Takasu  adding that the Secretariat looked forward to a decision by the Assembly as soon as possible “to keep the solvency of the regular budget”. He paid particular tribute to the 28 Member States that had paid in full their assessments that were due and payable as of 9 October 2014.  “Given the limited reserves available  the financial health of the Organization continues to depend on Member States meeting their financial obligations in full and on time.  On behalf of the Secretary-General  let me urge all Member States to continue to endeavour to do so.” In other business today  the Committee also discussed the activities of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) and the Independent Audit Advisory Committee  as well as the Organization’s use of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). Carman Lapointe  Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services  introduced the OIOS reports regarding its activities ending on 30 June 2014  while Joseph Christopher Mihm  Chair of the Independent Audit Advisory Committee  introduced that body’s report on its activities for the year-long period ending 31 July 2014. The Committee’s discussion on accounting standards began with the introduction of the Secretariat report on the Organization’s adoption of the international standards by Pedro Guarzo  Director of the Accounts Division of the Department of Management’s Office of Programme Planning  Budget and Accounting.  Hugh O’Farrell (United Kingdom)  Chair of the Audit Operations Committee of the Board of Auditors  then introduced the Auditing Board’s report on IPSAS implementation  while Carlos Ruiz Massieu  Chair of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions  introduced that body’s report. Also speaking today were representatives of Bolivia (on behalf of the Group of 77 and China)  Switzerland (also on behalf of Liechtenstein)  Philippines  United States and Ethiopia  as well as the European Union Delegation. The Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Tuesday  14 October  to discuss financial reports and reports of the Board of Auditors; the Joint Inspection Unit report on Implementing Partners  and construction and property management issues  which are part of the programme budget 2014-2015 agenda item. Activities of Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) & Independent Audit Advisory Committee (IAAC) CARMAN LAPOINTE  Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services  introduced the reports of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on its activities for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 (documents A/69/308 (Part I) and Add.1). Noting that this year marked the twentieth anniversary of the establishment of OIOS  she said that its key objectives continued to focus on supporting the Secretary-General in his oversight responsibilities.  During the reporting period  the Office issued 326 oversight reports  including five reports to the General Assembly.  A number of those reports focused on areas of particular strategic interest to the Organization  including implementation of Umoja and the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).  The reports included 936 recommendations to improve internal controls  accountability mechanisms and organizational efficiency and effectiveness  of which 45 were classified as critical. She said that audit recommendations had been categorized using the five components of internal control: control environment  risk assessment  control activities  information and communication  and monitoring.  OIOS implemented internal improvements  including: updating operating procedures and manuals; articulating programme impact pathways for each division; developing key performance indicators for managing activities; and assessing its own operational risks with the assistance of the Enterprise Risk Management focal point.  In addition  it was enhancing its risk-based planning process to leverage the results of the recently developed Organization-wide risk register. JOSEPH CHRISTOPHER MIHM  Chair of the Independent Audit Advisory Committee  introduced that body’s report on its activities for the period from 1 August 2013 to 31 July 2014 (document A/69/304). He said that the report contained his Committee’s detailed views  observations and recommendations.  Regarding implementation of oversight bodies’ recommendations  management continued to make progress  although there was room for improvement.  If the weaknesses identified by oversight bodies were properly addressed by management  one should expect to see a more accountable  effective and responsive Organization.  On risk management and internal control framework  IAAC called on the Secretary-General to secure sufficient capacity to effectively implement and sustain the Enterprise Risk Management. Turning to OIOS’s strategic direction and measures of effectiveness  he said that IAAC recommended that OIOS establish a long-term strategic plan to address  among other things  the alignment of its goals with the United Nations key risks and latest transformational initiatives.  The strategy should also include a focus on the Organization’s major challenges such as procurement fraud and annual goals for each division consistent with the strategic plan. On OIOS operational and budgetary independence  he said IAAC would closely follow any specific proposals relating to OIOS’s funding arrangement and the possible need for a legal advisor.  As for public disclosure of OIOS internal audit reports  IAAC thought that Member States  key internal and external stakeholders and the public should have access to the work of OIOS.  Managers reported that  to date  there had been no negative consequences.  Given the apparent success of the pilot project  IAAC endorsed the continued publication of international audit reports and  as a next step  OIOS should consider the publication of its evaluation reports. DAYANA ANGELA RIOS REQUENA (Bolivia)  speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  stressed the independent nature of OIOS’ work.  Its evaluations  however  should be carried out efficiently and effectively to implement programs and mandates of the Organization.  The work must also be done in line with relevant mandates of intergovernmental bodies  particularly the Committee for Programme and Coordination.  Along those lines  the Group reaffirmed the role of the General Assembly as the principal United Nations oversight organ and emphasized that the approval  change and discontinuation of legislative mandates were the exclusive prerogatives of intergovernmental legislative bodies. She also stressed the importance of continued coordination between OIOS and other oversight bodies  namely the Board of Auditors and the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU).  OIOS needed to establish fully integrated long-term strategic planning  with its objectives properly aligned with crucial United Nations risks and initiatives  such as staff mobility  IPSAS  Umoja and the Capital Master Plan.  On OIOS’s investigations services  she said a high vacancy rate would jeopardize the Office’s ability to properly fulfil its mandates  especially in the field.  Vacancies should be filled based on the principle of gender equality and equitable geographical distribution.  The Group also looked forward to a comprehensive discussion on IAAC recommendations. CARMEL POWER  a representative of the European Union Delegation  welcomed the OIOS efforts to work together with other United Nations oversight bodies and urged enhanced coordination to avoid duplication in their work.  The Union would address issues of strategic planning  risk management and vacancy rates during the informal consultations.  The bloc also welcomed IAAC’s views on the positive results of the pilot project on the public disclosure of OIOS international audit reports and endorsed its recommendation to continue the publication of the reports. Ms. SCHWEIZ (Switzerland)  speaking also for Liechtenstein  said that operational independence was a vital precondition for any oversight function  whether internal or external.  The highly fragmented funding structure of OIOS could negatively impact its operational independence.  Her delegation welcomed IAAC’s recommendation that OIOS establish a long-term strategic plan aligned with key United Nations risks.  She was also pleased that Enterprise Risk Management was finally given the necessary attention by top management and saw merit in IAAC’s recommendation to bring together the collective good work of the oversight bodies in one place. LIBRAN N. CABACTULAN (Philippines) said his delegation was pleased with the stronger functioning of OIOS  particularly its periodic external quality review process.  Those reviews gave Member States a benchmark for more informative decisions when assessing the Office’s requests and proposals.  He appreciated the Office’s efforts to assess and prioritize its audit recommendations based on risks and by highlighting the most critical recommendations.  There were 45 critical recommendations for the reporting period and those with financial implications totalled about $13.8 million.  He was also concerned that 25 critical recommendations  dating from previous recommendations made back to 2010  were still overdue.  IAAC had provided significant observations on how OIOS could increase its effectiveness  including the need for a fully integrated long-term strategic plan.  Another measure included addressing strategic goals aligned with risks and the Secretariat’s latest transformational initiatives  such as mobility  IPSAS  Umoja and the Capital Master Plan.  He also noted the need for client surveys to measure the performance of the Investigations Division and the Office as a whole. CHERITH A. NORMAN CHALET (United States) highlighted IAAC’s recommendation for the oversight bodies to explore doing a collaborative review of a single topic or organization.  That would help Member States have a complete picture of the issues under consideration and better assist them in performing their oversight duties.  Based on the overall success of the pilot project in public disclosure of OIOS internal audit reports  she urged the Assembly to make publication of those reports permanent.  Her delegation felt that greater authority over its budget would allow OIOS to perform its oversight functions free of influence from the organizations and officials it oversaw.  Her delegation looked forward to a review of the Office’s funding arrangement  including its impact on operational independence.  Noting efforts to transfer all investigations to OIOS  she said that the Office should focus on proactively pursuing and investigating serious cases of fraud  mismanagement of resources  corruption and sexual exploitation. TEKEDA ALEMU (Ethiopia)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that language in paragraph 36 of the OIOS report might lead to a wrong interpretation of the work of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA).  Citing the reference to “limited evidence on how ECA’s research and analysis influenced policy formulation”  he said ECA had actually become a critical institution like a think tank.  Ms. LAPOINTE said OIOS recognized the work of ECA  but it could develop better measures to track such influence.  Mr. MIHM pointed to the recommendation that oversight bodies explore an opportunity to bring together short documents. International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) PEDRO GUARO  Director  Accounts Division  Office of Programme Planning  Budget and Accounts  Department of Management  introduced the Secretary-General’s seventh progress report on the adoption of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards by the United Nations (document A/69/367)  for the 12 months ended 31 August 2014. He said that IPSAS implementation at the United Nations began as planned with peacekeeping operations on 1 July 2013.  Currently  the Organization was preparing its first IPSAS-compliant financial statements for peacekeeping operations  due by 30 September 2014.  A few remaining tasks must be completed before the delivery of those documents.   For the Organization’s other operations  he said  IPSAS-compliant accounting started on 1 January 2014 and all reporting entities  including the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)  United Nations Programme for Human Settlements (UN-Habitat)  International Trade Center  United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) and the tribunals  would produce IPSAS-compliant financial statements by 31 March 2015. HUGH O’FARRELL (United Kingdom)  Chair of the Audit Operations Committee of the Board of Auditors  introduced a note by the Secretary-General transmitting the Board’s fourth and final progress report on IPSAS implementation (document A/69/155).  He said that by the end of 2014  all United Nations system entities  including the United Nations and its funds and programmes  would have implemented IPSAS.  The level of progress reflected the commitment and energy of the entities concerned and represented a major step towards the modernization of the United Nations system.  All the entities that went live in 2012 received unqualified audit opinions  and the remaining entities going live in 2014 had made significant progress.  The real test  and the focus of future audits  would be whether the entities could quickly translate the new information into measurable improvements in operations and the cost-effective delivery of mandates. There was clear evidence that IPSAS implementation had led to improved financial management processes  but less evidence that the new financial information was being used outside of finance units to drive improvements in business functions  operations and the cost effectiveness of mandate delivery.  Progress in transforming the role of the finance functions across United Nations entities had been uneven.  Major issues with bank reconciliations  accounts payable and payroll had emerged following the implementation of the Organization’s new enterprise resource planning system in peacekeeping operations.  The Board could not provide assurance over the control environment for the full consolidation process across the United Nations complex architecture for the production of IPSAS financial statements. CARLOS RUIZ MASSIEU  Chair of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ)  introduced that body’s related report (document A/69/414).  He welcomed the achievement of important milestones for peacekeeping operations  especially the production of their first IPSAS financial statements.  For the other operations  the Advisory Committee was confident that IPSAS financial statements would be delivered by 31 March 2015 and noted that the project expenditures had remained within the indicative budget of $27 million.  Expressing concern about the continued delay in Umoja implementation and the risk it posed to the realization of the full benefits of IPSAS  he said that the Advisory Committee recommended that the Secretary-General track and report on the realization of those benefits across the Secretariat.  ACABQ was pleased to note that 21 of the 24 United Nations entities had successfully adopted IPSAS and had received unqualified audit opinions from the Board of Auditors on their 2013 financial statements. Ms. RIOS REQUENA (Bolivia)  speaking again for the Group of 77 and China  welcomed the progress made in the implementation of IPSAS across the United Nations system  particularly at the Secretariat.  The Group noted that 21 out of 24 entities had successfully implemented those international standards and the Group looked forward to updates on the progress of the remaining three entities:  the Secretariat  World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO).  The Group noted that the delay in the deployment of Umoja had contributed to delays in the international standards’ use.  The Group emphasized that the Umoja and IPSAS teams had to keep working together to mitigate significant risks and guarantee the expected benefits of the international accounting tools.  The Group urged that the best practices and lessons — gained as key stakeholders were trained in the use of IPSAS — be extended to the training of end users and others in Umoja.  The Group re-emphasized the need to track and record the expenditures and benefits of the project through its implementation. Ms. POWER  a representative of the European Union Delegation  said that IPSAS implementation was not a goal in itself  and that it should lead to new and more accurate financial information.  The Union was concerned that the new financial information was not being sufficiently used outside of finance units to drive improvements in business functions  operations and the cost-effectiveness of mandate delivery  given the fiscal and economic constraints and increased financial risks facing the United Nations.  The Union remained also concerned about the delayed Umoja implementation  which could negatively impact the IPSAS reporting timeline. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-09,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaef3397.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The Second Committee (Economic and Financial) was the only Main Committee of the General Assembly to date that had adopted a decision on improvements to working methods  Committee Chair Sebastiano Cardi (Italy) told delegates today. “Significant progress has been made ” he said  outlining several improvements already implemented but warning members of the need to remain vigilant.  Monitoring of working methods had to continue in order to find where refinements might be needed. The Committee faced “a crush of concurrent processes  dialogues and conferences” in the coming months  the representative of the United States pointed out.  He stressed that it was more important than ever for the Committee to be “strategic and disciplined”  underlining the importance of negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda  and joining a unanimous expression by delegates of the need for increased effectiveness and efficiency in the Committee’s work. Canada’s representative warned that the Committee should not “disrupt  pre-empt or otherwise replicate” intergovernmental negotiations on the route to September 2015  supporting the aim of ensuring that Committee resolutions were not used to prejudice or prejudge the outcome of the post-2015 discussion. In that context  he said that “a dozen  if not more” texts required no more than procedural treatment or technical update and the Committee’s 2015 session should be spared from overburdening by proscribing future actions within the current session’s texts. Also identifying scope for improvements  particularly on the timely conclusion of the Committee’s work  the representative of Barbados  who spoke on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  said proposed changes to working methods should aim to enhance its functioning and status.  Efforts to streamline agenda items had to improve the quality of deliberations and any decisions on biennialization or triennialization required careful consideration. The representative of the Delegation of the European Union supported proposals for biennialization and triennialization of drafts  as well as the idea to merge texts into omnibus documents.  The role of the Committee’s Bureau could be strengthened to help it ensure coherence in its work and to help ensure implementation of decision 65/530. Other delegations also offered suggestions on how to improve the Committee’s working methods  with Singapore’s representative suggesting that the Committee scrap the general debate and go straight to discussion of agenda items  and Iceland’s representative encouraging the Secretariat to make available as early as possible information on the high-level officials and experts who presented reports to the Committee.  For small delegations such as hers  such information greatly aided planning. Representatives of Switzerland and Japan also made statements. Prior to the discussion on working methods  the Committee concluded its general debate  with the representative of Liberia  who spoke on behalf of the Mano River Union  describing the negative impact of the Ebola outbreak in the countries of his group.  The virus threatened peace and security and development aspirations  putting health systems under so much pressure that they could not deal with illnesses other than Ebola. Also speaking in the general debate were representatives of Bulgaria  Fiji  United Arab Emirates  and Jordan. Representatives of the Food and Agricultural Organization (also speaking on behalf of the World Food Programme and the International Fund for Agricultural Development)  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies also spoke in the general debate. Committee Chair Sebastiano Cardi notified delegates of adjustments to the Committee’s programme of work as contained in document A/C.2/69/L.1.  They were the announcement of new dates for a side event and a joint meeting with the Economic and Social Council  and announcement of a new date for consideration of “Agriculture development  food security and nutrition”. The Second Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. on 13 October to consider “External debt sustainability and development”. Statements RADINA KOLEVA and ANI KOLEVA (Bulgaria) said that young people between the ages of 10 and 24 formed a quarter of the world’s population  yet they did not participate in the decision-making process in any way.  They were a major human resource for development and should be the key agents for positive social change globally.  However  unemployment was a major obstacle for them to actively contribute to development.  They were three times more likely to be unemployed than adults  with one in six young people out of job  education or training.  When they could not fulfil their potential  development was delayed.  As such  they called on Governments to substantially reduce the proportion of young people not in employment or training by providing support for and investment in formal and non-formal education  focused on entrepreneurial and leadership skills.  Young people should not only be the objects of policies but also should be recognized as key partners in their elaboration.  Accordingly  their full participation in the post-2015 development agenda was vital. PENI B. SUVEINAKAMA (Fiji)  associating himself with the Group of 77 developing countries and China  Alliance of Small Island States  and Group of Pacific Small Island Developing States  said the Samoa Pathway outlined a broad vision which placed an integrated approach  coupled with partnerships  as an indispensable requirement for the attainment of sustainable development.  Moreover  the Third International Conference on Financing for Development provided a critical basis for ensuring the full realization of the post-2015 development agenda.  As an ocean State  his country was highly dependent on a healthy marine environment for key developmental sectors such as tourism  transport and fisheries.  Thus  it was of utmost importance to conserve and sustainably manage and use marine resources  he said  calling for a stand-alone goal on oceans and seas as well as one on climate change in the post-2015 agenda. KHAULA ALI KHAMIS OBAID ALSHAMSI (United Arab Emirates)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  underlined the importance of poverty eradication and support for countries in special situations.  The report of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals should not be renegotiated and commitments on upholding recommendations on financing for development had to be upheld.  Sustainable development needed the participation of all sectors of society  requiring empowerment of women nationally and internationally.  Special attention was needed to tackle climate change and collective  coordinated efforts were vital  particularly to provide assistance with adaptation.  Reiterating solidarity with the Palestinian people and their aim to establish an independent State  she called on the international community and financial institutions to provide assistance to ensure its basic needs were fulfilled until a final settlement was achieved. NOUR MAMDOUH KASEB ALJAZI (Jordan)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  underlined the importance of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals report.  Gaps in achievement of the current Millennium Development Goals had to be addressed.  Poverty eradication must be at the core of the post-2015 agenda with better incorporation of the three pillars of sustainable development and of the global changes that had occurred since the Millennium Development Goals were agreed.  The Conference on Financing for Development would achieve an ambitious outcome  while climate change would best be dealt with through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Kyoto Protocol.  Lima was an important step in the journey to achieving a final agreement at the Paris conference in 2015. REMONGAR T. DENNIS (Liberia)  speaking on behalf of the Mano River Union and associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  African Group and the Group of Least Developed Countries  described how the post-conflict development trajectories of the States of the Union had been put at high risk because of the Ebola outbreak.  That virus had claimed many lives and threatened peace and security and development aspirations.  Health-care systems faced immense pressure and were unable to respond to illnesses like measles  typhoid  malaria  diarrhoea and others because they were geared totally towards Ebola.  Cultural practices like shaking hands or traditional burial could not be followed  while development projects were suspended and farming  mining  manufacturing and other sectors were disrupted.  Deaths continued to rise  suggesting weak progress in containing the epidemic. The global economic system needed serious analysis  he said  calling for a united front dedicated to achieving stable global economic growth.  The Millennium Development Goals deadline loomed and efforts to achieve them were ongoing.  In many areas progress had been made  but some Goals lagged.  Discussion on the post-2015 agenda brought into focus the needs and issues associated with small island developing States and the Samoa Pathway underscored the need for international solidarity with such countries.  A comprehensive financing framework for the post-2015 development process was needed and was the concern of all States  while the sustainable development goals needed to recognize national circumstances  capacities and priorities. SHARON BRENNEN-HAYLOCK  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)  also speaking on behalf of the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)  said the latest State of Food Insecurity report revealed a fall in the number of people suffering hunger and undernourishment globally.  The Millennium Development Goals hunger target was within reach  but marked disparities in successes between regions remained.  Sub-Saharan Africa and Western Asia showed only modest progress  for example.  Extreme poverty had been halved between 1990 and 2010  but the number undernourished was only 20 per cent lower.  The aim was a “zero hunger world” and sustained political commitment was needed.  Climate-smart agriculture could help address the interlinked challenges of food security  and climate change and family farming would be the theme of the 2014 World Food Day.  IFAD  WFP and FAO had initiatives that sought to boost the contribution of the agricultural sector to increasing incomes and ensuring food security within the context of a changing climate. JAMIL AHMAD  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)  said the Organization’s Environment Assembly had reaffirmed States' commitment to the environmental pillar of sustainable development  expressing a vision of socioeconomic prosperity without degradation.  The Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals had further emphasized that objective.  He discussed other work of the Assembly on various issues  including air quality and illegal trade in wildlife.  The Organization was on the way to a sustainable development agenda and the Second Committee had a concrete opportunity to further mainstream environmental sustainability in the work of the United Nations system.  UNEP was engaged in various inter-agency activities related to sustainable development  including the National Cleaner Production Centres with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO); UN-REDD with FAO and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); and the Greener Cities Partnership with UN-Habitat.  UNEP also supported system-wide support for small island developing States. ANNE BANG CHRISTENSEN  observer for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)  said that with 1.2 billion people living in extreme poverty  2.4 billion lacking access to basic sanitation  and more than 800 million going to bed hungry every night  her organization was addressing the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable.  She stressed the critical connection between reducing disaster risk and ensuring poverty eradication.  Disasters had often set back years of progress towards sustainable development  with disaster risk increasing due to urbanization and climate change.  Unless disaster resilience featured prominently in the post-2015 agenda  progress towards sustainable development would be threatened for years to come. JAN PIROUZ POULSEN (European Union) said the Committee should not duplicate or pre-empt the negotiations taking place outside of it in parallel intergovernmental processes.  If they agreed to a more focused approach to the Committee’s work during that session  they could create more space to improve its working methods.  The post-2015 development agenda  once adopted  would eventually also become the Committee’s agenda  he said.  As such  that was why he would welcome a comprehensive discussion on how to best ensure that the Committee  Economic and Social Council  and the high-level political forum on sustainable development could effectively follow-up on the outcomes of the July 2015 International Conference on Financing for Development and the September 2015 Summit. He saw a stronger role for the Bureau in protecting the Committee’s policy coherence by proposing measures that would counter the increased fragmentation and proliferation of resolutions at the sub-agenda/issues level.  In that regard  he supported the Bureau proposal for biennialization or triennialization of specific resolutions  as well as the proposal for a merger or combination of concrete resolutions into omnibus-type resolutions.  Another area where he saw a need for strong Bureau guidance was in ensuring that the Committee implemented decision 65/530.  Finally  while fully respecting the mandate of the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) over budgetary issues  basic information on possible cost implications of the Second Committee draft resolutions should be made available in due time in order for delegations to take the best informed decisions during negotiations. KEREETA NICOLE WHYTE (Barbados)  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  said she was mindful of the quality  relevance and timeliness of the Committee outcomes.  There was scope for improvement in the Committee’s functioning  particularly regarding the timely conclusion of its work.  They must ensure that the proposed changes enhanced its functioning and status.  Any proposals for streamlining the agenda items should improve the quality of the Committee deliberations  and any decisions on biennialization or triennialization should be carefully considered.  She also called for the Committee’s handling of decisions to remain timely and relevant. Certain proposals for the Committee’s work went beyond procedural and organizational considerations  she said  calling for a balanced integration of the three pillars of sustainable development.  They might wish to consider a relocation of agenda items at some point  and the consideration of the aspects that went beyond procedural might be best addressed following the adoption of the post-2015 agenda.  She welcomed cooperation between the Committee and the Economic and Social Council.  Moreover  since the social dimension of sustainable development was mainly dealt with within the Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural)  she highlighted the importance of cooperation between the two Committees. TATJANA VON STEIGER WEBER (Switzerland) said review of methods was important ahead of the post-2015 development agenda.  Resolutions could be merged so as better to integrate the three pillars of sustainable development.  She wondered whether it would be worth rationalizing agenda items so that resolutions could be more comprehensive but fewer in number.  Looking back to the sixty-sixth session  prior to the Rio+20 Conference  many sustainable development resolutions had been procedural in nature.  Given the negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda and on the financing for development conference  she called for a similar approach to be taken in the current session. DOUGLAS CAREY (United States) stressed the importance of improvements to working methods given that the Committee faced “a crush of concurrent processes  dialogues and conferences”  with negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda at the centre.  It was more important than ever to be “strategic and disciplined” and there was a need to avoid confusion or duplication of effort.  The Committee’s broader weaknesses could also be addressed  and he applauded the Bureau for already undertaking many proposals  including enforcing deadlines  indicating changes to draft texts and rules for extensions.  Convening the current discussion at the start of the Committee’s session was also positive.  He welcomed any additional proposals that would ensure timely submissions of drafts  improve efficiency and enable completion of work on time.  Guidelines for facilitators on responding to questions about programme budget implications were welcome and he supported streamlining of texts by various means. MASATO USUI (Japan) said that most of the Committee’s work was related to the post-2015 development agenda and financing for development  and should thus avoid duplicating the work done as part of those two processes.  Its work should be streamlined and effective  he said  noting that further streamlining of the agenda  clusters and resolutions in line with the post-2015 development agenda might be necessary in the future. MARIA MJOLL JONSDOTTIR (Iceland)  associating herself with the European Union  noted that her country’s small delegation benefited immensely from comprehensive information from the Secretariat for planning purposes.  Good information was available on QuickPlace but the list of high-level officials and experts who presented reports to the Second Committee should also be made available as early as possible.  Such was the practice in the Third and Fifth Committees  even in instances where lists remained subject to change.  In the future  such a list should be made available annually  before the start of the work of the Committee. MICHAEL DOUGLAS GRANT (Canada) said it was essential that the Second Committee not “disrupt  pre-empt or otherwise replicate” intergovernmental negotiations on the route to September 2015.  He supported the aim of ensuring that Committee resolutions were not used to prejudice or prejudge the outcome of the post-2015 discussion.  That was best achieved by using procedural resolutions for subject areas implicated in the post-2015 agenda and for issues addressed in other forums and conferences.  “A dozen  if not more” resolutions required no more than procedural treatment or technical update.  Adoption of the post-2015 agenda would offer a chance to rationalize the Committee’s agenda.  Next year’s agenda should be spared from overburdening by proscribing future actions within the current session’s resolutions.  Practical options included highlighting all new language in bold typeface  and the staggering of resolutions that fell under the same agenda item or that treated similar subject matter.  Strict adherence to deadlines would also allow help with the conclusion of work on schedule.  QuickPlace should also be used more and there should be greater communication with the budget office to identify budgetary implications of proposals as early as possible. LIM MIN JING (Singapore) said that it was an important year for the Committee  due to the ongoing process of developing the post-2015 agenda.  She called for increased effectiveness and efficiency of its working methods  suggesting that delegations make their statements concise and upload the longer versions if necessary.  Draft resolutions should be circulated early to give delegates enough time for deliberation and negotiation.  Moreover  she proposed the Committee not to hold a general debate  but to go straight to the discussion of the agenda items  following the examples of the Third and Fourth Committee. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-09,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gadis3499.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. To win the battle to eliminate nuclear weapons  the international community first needed to fight long and hard at the conceptual level and win the “battle of ideas”  the Disarmament Committee heard today as it continued its general debate. In a wide-ranging discussion that touched on the growing complexity and ambiguity of contemporary threats  the representative of Chile warned that delegitimizing nuclear arms would involve exposing the “persistent fallacy” that possessing them was a guarantee of peace. He called that narrative false  saying it had provided sustenance to the doctrines of the cold war  which had supported “erroneous perceptions” regarding the security benefits associated with nuclear weapons. Similarly  Norway’s representative said efforts to diminish the role of nuclear weapons in security policies must continue  and the process of reducing them — she said 17 000 still remained — must be accelerated  with the ultimate aim of securing all nuclear material.  Everyone  she declared  was concerned about the catastrophic effects of a nuclear detonation. The representative of Canada urged the international community to approach the challenges with unwavering commitment and not stand idle in the face of non-compliance with relevant bodies and norms.  Differences needed to be overcome to advance shared interests  she said  of the view that the coming year would present crucial tests for the global non-proliferation and disarmament system. The representative of Iraq stressed collective responsibility towards disarmament-related conventions  agreements and international arrangements.  Turkey’s delegate cautioned  however  that core mechanisms in that area were not functioning as effectively as they should.  With that  he said words must be complemented by “concrete steps towards action”. Time was of the essence in furthering the process  agreed the representative of Ireland  underscoring a collective “duty of care” to rid the world of nuclear weapons while warning that “later might simply be too late”.  He noted significant progress in relation to chemical and biological weapons  but said the horrific images of children gasping for breath near Damascus  in August 2013  after ingesting sarin gas had propelled the international community into action. Astonished at “astronomical” global defence budgets  Nigeria’s speaker said nuclear arsenals were being maintained and upgraded by nuclear-weapon States.  Against a global backdrop fraught with instability  those ultimate weapons of mass destruction posed an existential threat to the world.  Moreover  they offered no credible defence against enemies with similar weapons  he said  calling for their elimination to be the eventual objective of all disarmament processes. Also speaking were the representatives of Lesotho  Yemen  Saudi Arabia  China  Venezuela  Georgia  South Africa  Ecuador  Ethiopia and Qatar. Exercising their right of reply were representatives of Syria  Saudi Arabia  the Russian Federation and Georgia. The First Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. on 11 October  to continue its general debate. Background The First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) met this morning to continue its general debate.  For background  see Press Release GA/DIS/3498. Statements KELEBONE MAOPE (Lesotho) said that the international community’s commitment to achieve a world free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction had “not translated into concrete action” and cast a “shadow of doubt” on attaining that goal in the immediate future.  Nuclear weapons created a false sense of security  breeding mistrust and heightening tensions between States.  As they existed  he warned  the risk of their use remained.  As a result  efforts must be redoubled during this session to rid the world of those horrendous weapons.  At the same time  he reiterated that all States were entitled to enjoy their right to peaceful uses of nuclear energy  if exercised safely and securely.  In that regard  cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was “absolutely essential”. On the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  he said that there was no doubt that its entry into force would halve the proliferation of nuclear weapons and their modernization.  He called for its ratification by the remaining “Annex 2” States  adding that pronouncements of ratification were not meaningful unless they were accompanied by tangible action.  The impasse in the United Nations disarmament machinery  particularly the Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament and the Disarmament Commission was worrying  he said  urging the Conference to agree to and implement a balanced work programme  while reviewing the membership in order to make it more representative.  Member States must “rise above their individual interest” to reach a consensual outcome in 2015  when the new cycle begins. Turning to conventional weapons  he said it was gratifying that the international community had demonstrated a collective resolve to achieve the required number of ratifications to bring the Arms Trade Treaty into force later this year.  Nonetheless  a fair and balanced implementation of the Treaty would be critical in order to transform the global trade in arms and achieve the instrument’s goals.  Progress would also be needed on the 2001 United Nations Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons  which claimed scores of lives in Africa and elsewhere.  A lack of predictable funding was a stumbling block for the Programme’s effective implementation and  as such  there was a need for greater international cooperation. MOHAMED ALI ALHAKIM (Iraq)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  stressed the collective responsibility to implement the disarmament-related conventions  agreements and international arrangements.  Iraq had deposited the instrument of accession to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material  to be the 150th State party.  Iraq was also a member of the major arms control agreements and had been one of the first countries to have adhered to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1969.  His country was also a party to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  the two conventions on biological and chemical weapons  the additional protocol of the IAEA safeguards system  as well as the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and the Mine Ban Convention  among others. The proliferation of small and light weapons was no less a threat than nuclear weapons  he said  calling on the international community to firmly seek implementation of all relevant resolutions to combat proliferation.  Weapons of all kinds impeded development and could easily find their way into the hands of terrorist groups when countries had weak export regulations.  In that regard  Iraq welcomed the Arms Trade Treaty and called for the intensification of diplomatic efforts to provide support to affected countries.  His country was itself one of those most affected by mines and small munitions.  Establishing a zone in the Middle East free from nuclear and other mass destruction weapons was an important step  and he called for the immediate commencement of negotiations in that regard. LEVENT ELER (Turkey) echoed calls for a world without nuclear weapons  but said they must be complemented by concrete steps towards action.  Unfortunately  the core mechanism  the NPT  was not functioning as effectively as it should.  Nevertheless  the disarmament community must remain optimistic while seeking practical outcomes  he said  adding that the extent to which the nuclear-weapon States were willing to fulfil their disarmament commitments impacted the success and credibility of the NPT.  At the same time  the right to peaceful use of nuclear energy must be carefully upheld along with the relevant international obligations. He said that  as the current NPT Review cycle came to a close  Turkey shared the frustration of many Member States on the non-implementation of the consensus Action Plan of the 2010 review.  Commitments had been overlooked and promises had not been upheld  he noted  highlighting the commitment to begin negotiations in 2012 on a Middle East zone free from weapons of mass destruction.  Turkey supported globally recognized and verifiable zones and welcomed the signing of the Protocol of the Central Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone  by the five nuclear-weapon States.  He urged full ratification of the treaties and protocols of all five regional zones. Underlining the special responsibility of the Conference on Disarmament in the modern disarmament agenda  he urged that body to resume its substantive work without delay.  Towards this end  he viewed the re-establishment of the Informal Working Group as a sign of willingness to urgently reach a consensual programme. He went on to highlight the importance of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Convention  and confirmed that Turkey did not possess such weapons.  The country supported implementation of those treaties as well as efforts to promote their universalization.  Turkey would continue to cooperate with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to dismantle the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons inventory.  Turkey condemned the use of those weapons on civilian populations in Syria  which was an “abhorrent violation” of the United Nations Charter and international law. ELISSA GOLBERG (Canada) said that the proliferation of mass destruction weapons  be they nuclear  chemical or biological  remained among the most pressing challenges to global peace and security.  The coming year would feature a series of crucial tests for the global non-proliferation and disarmament system  which the international community must approach with an unwavering commitment to concrete outcomes.  In a tense global context  that would necessitate overcoming differences in order to advance shared interests.  She called for the urgent commencement of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty  which would have significant value for global security. She said strengthening non-proliferation bodies and norms remained a priority  and the international community must not stand idle in the face of non-compliance  which could undermine those instruments and the security and stability they sought to guarantee.  In that regard  Canada remained “deeply sceptical” of Iran’s nuclear ambitions.  A nuclear-armed Iran would not only have devastating consequences for regional stability and security  but also undercut the integrity of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime.  Despite diplomatic progress  the regime’s failure to engage in any meaningful way with the international community to address long-standing concerns regarding its nuclear programme raised serious doubts about the country’s true motives.  Further  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea must abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile program  and Syria must ensure complete compliance with its obligations under Security Council resolution 2118 (2013) and the Chemical Weapons Convention. On conventional weapons  she said that ending the era of anti-personnel mines was within reach  and she urged all States parties to join the Mine Ban Convention.  Canada remained firmly committed to the Convention on Cluster Munitions and was in the process of ratifying it.  Her country had never used those weapons and had destroyed all stockpiles of those weapons. AMJAD ALKUMAIM (Yemen) said that against the backdrop of global instability  the failure to achieve the goals of the NPT and the weak implementation of other treaties had led to a worsening of humanitarian and economic situations.  That was particularly true in the Middle East.  Given the role of disarmament in the maintenance of international peace and security  it should be a top priority at the United Nations. He said his country deplored the fact that the international community had not yet been able to hold a conference on ridding the Middle East of mass destruction weapons  as recommended in the Outcome Document of the 2010 Review Conference.  Despite the willingness shown by Arab countries on that front  the major Powers must redouble their efforts to ensure that such a conference is convened.  There could be no peace until that threat was removed from the region.  In that regard  Yemen called on Israel to ratify the NPT.  It also supported the draft resolution by the Non-Aligned Movement calling for a global treaty on nuclear weapons  and a conference on that issue be held by 2018. On the CTBT  Yemen called on all States that had not yet joined it to do so without delay  he said  welcoming efforts by the Preparatory Committee to speed up the process.  Moving onto chemical weapons  some of the most deadly in the world  Yemen thanked the OPCW for its work and assistance to member States.  He highlighted the need to achieve disarmament in order to promote social and sustainable development.  Although the Arms Trade Treaty was an important milestone  Yemen was concerned at how it was being interpreted  stressing that countries could still obtain conventional weapons  but in the right manner.  Yemen had signed that Treaty.  He also stressed the importance of allowing the Conference on Disarmament to do its work  stressing that it was the only international forum that considered all disarmament issues on the international agenda. BREIFNE O’REILLY (Ireland)  associating with the New Agenda Coalition and the European Union  said that by this time next year  the Arms Trade Treaty would have entered into force.  His country was committed to ensuring that irresponsible arms flows  which destabilized States and contributed to violence  conflict and gross human rights violations  were stopped.  The international community must not be complacent  however  as the Treaty’s entry into force was just the beginning.  Its effective implementation and universalization would make a real difference and ultimately save lives. Significant progress had been made in relation to chemical and biological weapons  he said  noting that the overwhelming majority of States now agreed that the possession and use of such weapons under any circumstance was simply unacceptable.  It was precisely because of the success of the Chemical Weapons Convention that reports of the use of chlorine as a weapon in Syria earlier this year was met with absolute revulsion and utter condemnation.  The horrific images of children near Damascus gasping for breath after ingesting sarin gas in August 2013 had propelled the international community into action. He touched on the NPT as well as the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons  and expressed frustration that the CTBT had not yet entered into force.  With that  he urged the “Annex 2” States to ratify it as soon as possible.  In 1946  he noted  the international community recognized the necessity to rid the world of nuclear weapons  but nearly 70 years later  their role had not diminished.  If anything  with increased knowledge of the risks  there was a pressing “duty of care” for all Governments.  Later might simply be too late. ABDALLAH Y. AL-MOUALLIMI (Saudi Arabia)  associating with the Arab Group and Non-Aligned Movement  was concerned that the Middle East region had not yet established a nuclear-weapon-free zone and pointed to Israel as the cause for that delay.  Despite the adoption of several General Assembly resolutions  there had been no concrete action in that regard.  Furthermore  Saudi Arabia expressed deep regret at the postponement of a conference on that issue that was to have been held in Helsinki  Finland in 2012.  As that was a key pillar of the NPT  such a conference must be held as soon as possible.  That was the responsibility of the entire international community and any delay would cast severe doubts on the process of multilateral consensus  he said. He also stressed the importance of continuing negotiation with the “P5+1” over Iran’s nuclear programme  as well as the continuation of negotiations between the IAEA and Iran.  He urged a clear timeframe for those talks  stressing that Iran must reassure the world that its nuclear programme was peaceful.  At the same time  Saudi Arabia reaffirmed the inherent right of all States to obtain nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.  His country also reaffirmed the importance of the Chemical Weapons Convention  while voicing concern at the incomplete destruction of those stockpiles.  He commended efforts by the OPCW and the United Nations joint mission in Syria  acknowledging the exceptional circumstances in the transfer and destruction of that country’s chemical weapons.  However  that did not dispel his country’s “grave concern” about the “vagueness and inaccuracy” of the data included in the Syrian declaration.  Saudi Arabia urged firm adherence to the mandate on Syria until the perpetrators responsible for the “barbaric  immoral  and inhumane” attacks were brought to justice. WU HAITAO (China) said that the tragedies of the two world wars and the shadow of the cold war had made people around the world value peace and security more than ever.  Now  peace and development had become the mainstream of current times  and countries were growing more and more interdependent.  Arms control and disarmament were closely linked with international security  and the world should make joint efforts to promote those aims.  Nuclear disarmament should be approached in a step by step manner  and the risks of nuclear proliferation must be eliminated.  Countries with the largest nuclear arsenals should continue to make drastic reductions  while development of missile defence systems by certain countries should be abandoned. He urged timely measures to develop international norms through which all could benefit  as well as the building  through transparent cooperation  of peaceful and secure cyberspace activities.  China had consistently stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons  and adhered to the policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons while also honouring the commitment not to use or threaten to use them against non-nuclear-weapon States.  China stood for the peaceful uses of outer space as well  opposing its weaponization and an arms race in space.  Together with the Russian Federation  China had submitted to the Conference on Disarmament an updated draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space and of the threat of use of force against outer space objects.  China would continue to actively and fully participate in international arms control  disarmament and non-proliferation  and would make due contribution to safeguarding world peace and security. SAMUEL MONCADA (Venezuela)  associating with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that nuclear disarmament  especially the elimination of all nuclear weapons  was a priority objective for Latin American and Caribbean States.  That region had been declared a “region of peace” under the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean  or Treaty of Tlatelolco.  He firmly believed that setting up such a zone strengthened non-proliferation and international security.  In that regard  an international conference on the Middle East was extremely important  and he urged its convening as soon as possible  as that would be a decisive step for the peace process in that region. He rejected the use of chemical weapons in any circumstance and by anyone  and appealed to any State party to the Chemical Weapons Convention that still possessed those weapons to destroy them.  He reaffirmed the importance of the Programme of Action to combat the illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons  which negatively impacted several regions of the world.  The time had come to prevent the use of cyberspace as a weapon of war  for spying  sabotage and attacks against the infrastructure of other countries.  Standards should be adopted relating to the Internet to guarantee the protection of communications  particularly in connection with State sovereignty and citizens’ privacy. KAHA IMNADZE (Georgia) said that European security was once again “deliberately challenged” by the Russian Federation’s ongoing military aggression against Ukraine.  Efforts to alter international borders presented a serious threat to peace and stability and undermined the fundamental principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity.  Georgia condemned those actions and called on the Russian Federation to withdraw all its military forces and hardware from Ukraine  including from the Crimea region.  As a victim of the 2008 invasion  Georgia had experienced Russian military aggression.  As such  he called on the Russian Federation to abide by its international obligations and end its illegal occupation of sovereign Georgian territory. He said that the risk of nuclear terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction had become a major challenge to common security.  In that regard  full compliance with the relevant instruments must remain priorities of the international community.  Despite a broad understanding of the threat that nuclear weapons pose to humanity  the NPT lacked significant elements to provide a comprehensive response.  As a vital instrument for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation  the CTBT must enter into force without delay.  Georgia  for its part  continued to actively cooperate with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Provisional Technical Secretariat to strengthen its monitoring and verification system. Georgia shared the international community’s resolve regarding the illicit trade in conventional arms  he said  adding that the uncontrolled dissemination and accumulation of those weapons and ammunition represented a serious threat to international peace and security.  Efficient export control mechanisms were needed  and to that end  Georgia had passed a new version of the Law on Export and Import Control of Armaments  Military Equipment and Dual-use items  which entered into force on 1 October. GORDON BRISTOL (Nigeria) said that global defence budgets were “astronomical”.  Nuclear arsenals were being maintained and upgraded by nuclear-weapon States and unauthorized non-State actors had unfettered access to an array of conventional weapons.  From Africa to the Middle East  the unprecedented carnage and bloodshed unleashed by terrorists had left cities and communities destroyed or deserted  and led to the loss of precious lives  destruction of property and livelihoods.  Those mindless forms of aggression were largely enabled and effectively supported by illicitly purchased arms sold to non-State actors.  Access to a wide range of conventional weapons  including small arms and light weapons and their ammunition  was often denied to sovereign States  while at the same time  they were illicitly procured and indiscriminately used by terrorists and other bandits to unleash mayhem and unprecedented massacre of innocent civilians  including women and children. He said Nigeria bore living witness to the fact that small arms and light weapons in the hands of criminal gangs  terrorists and armed groups were responsible for more than 1 000 deaths each day.  In the current environment fraught with accidents and terrorism  he reaffirmed that nuclear weapons remained the ultimate weapons of mass destruction  and their total elimination  therefore  should be the final objective of all disarmament processes.  Those weapons offered no credible defence against other enemies possessing similar weapons  and they posed an existential threat to those who did not possess them at all. MAY-ELIN STENER (Norway) said that broad participation at the Oslo and Nayarit conferences reflected the international community’s recognition that the catastrophic effects of a nuclear detonation was of concern to all.  It had become clear that no State or international body would be able to address the immediate humanitarian emergency that would follow such an explosion.  While the number of nuclear weapons had significantly reduced since the end of the cold war  some 17 000 still remained.  The potential humanitarian impact had revived interest in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and the risks and consequences of continued collective inaction.  Norway encouraged all countries to participate in the 2015 NPT Review Conference and urged the full implementation of the review’s 2010 Plan of Action.  At the same time  Norway remained a staunch supporter of bilateral disarmament measures  such as the New START. She said that while there was little doubt about the overall objective to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons  there was disagreement as to how to reach that goal.  In that respect  the international community should continue efforts to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in security policies  while supporting new nuclear-weapon-free zones  notably in the Middle East.  Great importance must be attached to holding a meeting that would pave the way for such a zone before the 2015 NPT Review Conference.  At the same time  the process of reducing existing arsenals of nuclear weapons must be accelerated.  A nuclear-weapon-free world would not be possible without a credible  non-proliferation regime  she declared. Norway reaffirmed its commitment to nuclear security and looked forward to continuing that process in Washington in 2016  with the ultimate aim of securing all nuclear material.  However  robust verification systems were needed to instil confidence in the integrity of the process.  The United Kingdom and Norway had cooperated at the expert level to explore the technical and procedural challenges associated with a nuclear disarmament verification regime  she added. CARLOS OLGUÍN CIGARROA (Chile)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  said that to win the battle to eliminate nuclear weapons  the international community first needed to fight long and hard at the conceptual level and win the “battle of ideas”.  First  it was necessary to delegitimize nuclear arms through an exposure of the persistent fallacy that possessing nuclear weapons was a guarantee of peace.  That narrative was false and had provided sustenance to the doctrines of the cold war  which  in turn  supported the erroneous perceptions regarding the security benefits associated with nuclear weapons.  Nuclear weapons possessors must comply with their obligations under the NPT. He said that the effective inclusion of women in the disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control process should be a priority of and a commitment for all Member States.  Mechanisms should be implemented which allowed for real equality in decision-making and essential peace-promoting actions.  Similarly  civil society and non-governmental organizations occupied space in the United Nations disarmament machinery  and he opposed resistance to the incorporation of their opinions.  Chile  for its part  would be instrumental in ensuring that civil society was not only an observer in disarmament  but a participant. JOHANN KELLERMAN (South Africa) said that while some advances had been made during the past year in strengthening the multilateral disarmament and international security environment  much remained to be done.  The impasse in the disarmament machinery was of particular concern  he said  urging revitalization of the multilateral bodies so that they could again discharge their respective mandates.  The general lack of progress on nuclear disarmament was frustrating to the vast majority of United Nations Member States  and achievements in that area remained particularly uneven.  The NPT was constantly reaffirmed  and yet its pillar on nuclear disarmament remained neglected. He said South Africa  on many occasions  had expressed concern about the humanitarian impacts of cluster munitions.  Regarding landmines  he sought accelerated implementation of the Mine Ban Convention during the next five-year cycle.  South Africa stood ready to contribute towards creating a better world — one that was free of anti-personnel mines.  The implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons remained as relevant today as when it was adopted in 2001.  He looked forward to the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty and its full implementation. XAVIER LASSO MENDOZA (Ecuador)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that his country had recognized the “right of nature” in its Constitution for the first time.  Ecuador had also declared its national territory as a zone of peace.  He condemned the very existence of weapons of mass destruction  and considered their use or threat of use to be a crime against nature and humankind.  Nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation must be pursued in parallel as interrelated processes.  As a non-nuclear-weapon State  Ecuador had and would comply with its commitments under nuclear non-proliferation  and hoped that nuclear-armed States would live up to their nuclear disarmament commitments.  It could not be said that that commitment had been honoured  and it was now high time for the international community to recognize the priority given to nuclear disarmament and begin negotiating a universal and legally binding treaty to prohibit the development  possession  use and threat of use of those weapons. He said his country shared the concern over the stalemate in the Conference on Disarmament  which was due to a lack of political will.  He hoped the Conference would continue to offer the international community important legal instruments  as it had done with the Chemical Weapons Convention.  In that vein  the Disarmament Commission had not been able to adopt any recommendations  and he deemed it necessary to have an overall analysis of the disarmament architecture of the United Nations.  Ecuador was a party to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean  or Tlatelolco Treaty  which was the first nuclear-weapon-free zone in a heavily populated area.  He urged all States to make efforts to establish and strengthen other such zones  and called for the rapid convening of the conference for a Middle East zone. He expressed concern over new war technologies  particularly unmanned drones and autonomous killing machines  adding that the implications for international humanitarian law with regard to those weapons should be explored with the aim of banning them.  Security and international relations should be based on trust and respect  and a mass indiscriminate system of spying on world citizens  and attacks against State sovereignty introduced a serious element of instability in inter-State relations. NEGASH KEBRET BOTORA (Ethiopia) said that multilateralism remained the most reliable setting in which to comprehensively address critical global issues of international peace and security  including disarmament in all its aspects.  The unchecked proliferation of weapons of mass destruction posed great danger to all of humanity.  As those threats were deadly and complex in nature  they required a fundamental and effective global response.  Of paramount importance was curbing an escalating arms race and reducing stockpiles of all weapons of mass destruction through implementation of existing treaties and conventions. The African continent  he said  had shown its unwavering commitment to regional peace and security through the signing of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty  or Pelindaba Treaty  and the CTBT.  Ethiopia supported the early entry into force of the Test-Ban Treaty  and called on States that had not yet done so to sign and ratify it.  His country joined others in reaffirming the relevance and importance of the Conference on Disarmament  and was convinced that overcoming the impasse was an urgent priority.  As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement  Ethiopia supported various resolutions on the total elimination of nuclear weapons based on a specified timeframe. Regarding the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons  he welcomed the successful conclusion of the Fifth Biennial Meeting of States to consider the small arms and light weapons Program of Action.  However  their illicit trade and use continued to destabilize and create havoc in many parts of the world  including in the Horn of Africa.  For that reason  implementation of international and regional commitments and treaty-based obligations was critical. AHMED BIN MOHAMMAD AL-THANI (Qatar)  associating with the Arab Group and the Non-Aligned Movement  stressed the importance of a multilateral framework when dealing with disarmament and non-proliferation.  Despite the importance attached to disarmament  the stalemate in the Disarmament Commission since 1996 indicated a lack of political will to reach the desired objective.  He urged that a “ceiling” be set on objectives  with a view to reaching concrete results and recommendations.  Sadly  a conference on a zone free of nuclear and other mass destruction weapons in the Middle East had not been held due to the resistance of one country in the region.  However  creating that zone was an extremely important step and should be undertaken without delay. The spread of small arms and light weapons required all manufacturers and exporters to establish effective controls on their operations  he said  stressing also the importance of full implementation of the Programme of Action.  Qatar was keen to promote the NPT  which was an extremely important treaty that should be observed by all parties.  Non-proliferation was the basis for international peace and security  and cooperation was the only means through which to achieve that. Right of Reply Speaking in exercise of the right of reply  the representative of Syria reiterated the strong condemnation of the horrific use of chemical weapons against Syrian citizens and soldiers and said his country was committed to the full implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention in the framework of the OPCW.  It was amusing  then  that the Turkish and Saudi rulers had been making baseless allegations against Syria.  Those countries did not realize that hardly anyone in the Hall believed them.  Everyone present recognized the repulsive actions which those regimes had committed against humanity as a whole  as evidenced in their support for barbaric acts of terror and terrorist ideology.  The actions of those countries represented a “dark and bloody reality”  and even their friends did not believe them.  Allies of Turkey and Saudi Arabia had themselves said that those nations poured hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of tons of weapons into the fighting in Syria  including chemical weapons provided by Turkish and Saudi rulers. Wishing to sound a warning  he said that all present should beware of the rulers of Turkey and Saudi Arabia  as they wished only harm on all. The international community should be wary of their hidden intentions and be watchful  for they were willing to unleash a monster against countries and societies.  Turkey wanted to enter the European Union  but the world must realize that Turkey had an Ottoman agenda.  Many Europeans would remember the Ottomans  and would compare the Ottoman acts to the acts of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS).  “Beware  friends  and do not let them into your society ” he said.  As for the Saudi rulers  he asked delegations to look at how they treated their citizens.  Saudi Arabia funded terrorists around the world who only sought to spread killing  extremism and murder.  That had been seen from Bali to New York.  Saudi Arabia was the headquarters for international terrorism  and had made it their business to terrorize based on a perverted and perverse interpretation of Islam  which only Saudi Arabia represented. Also speaking in exercise of the right of reply  the representative of the Russian Federation cautioned the Georgian partners not to become involved in the “loud rhetoric” in connection with the Geneva discussions on security and stability of the trans-caucuses region.  He would urge Georgia to do its utmost to settle the problem in the Ossetia and the trans-caucuses  on the basis of mutual respect for the benefit of the peoples of Georgia and those sovereign States. The representative of Saudi Arabia said his delegation was surprised by Syria’s rhetorical way of hiding the truth.  The world had become a village indeed  and no one could hide the facts.  With regard to the statement made about the use of chemical weapons by helicopter gunships  that information was not a figment of the imagination but came from a report prepared by a fact-finding mission of the Human Rights Council.  Helicopter crafts  in the Syrian regime’s possession  were used to drop chlorine gas on Syrians.  That was mentioned in the report and was not made up.  Furthermore  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had been among the first countries at the United Nations to fight terrorism; it had contributed effectively to the establishment of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre and had taken part in many conferences held in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere with the sole objective of fighting terrorism.  His country had also contributed to the Centre for Rapprochement among religions  which also had been established as a means to fight extremism and terrorism.  Saudi Arabia had always made the best efforts to fight those who claimed to be affiliated with ISIS. The representative of Georgia said that the Russian Federation made several important arguments.  One was related to the Geneva discussions.  The First Committee must know that Georgia had participated in the Geneva discussions in good faith  and had a constructive approach to solving all outstanding issues with the Russian Federation.  However  the Geneva discussions were a result of the ceasefire agreement signed in August 2008  with the mediation of the European Union  and most of its provisions had not been met by the Russian Federation.  In fact  the Russian Federation was in breach of almost the entire agreement.  The Russian Federation also had used a second argument  telling Georgia to talk with the occupation regimes that Russia had established on Georgian soil.  Russia was an occupying Power  because it stationed its troops on Georgian soil without the consent of the Georgian Government.  Everyone knew that was a violation of international law.  The host country’s consent to allow foreign troops on its soil was absolutely essential.  Georgia tried its best to talk to communities on both sides of the line created by the Russian Federation and provided medical and educational services.  However  it was the Russian troops and the Government that hindered the peoples of Georgia  including in the occupied territories. Speaking a second time  the Russian Federation representative said he wished to remind Georgia and all delegations present that in the Geneva discussions it was not only Georgia and the Russian Federation  but also Abkhazia and South Ossetia participating as sovereign countries. Also speaking a second time  the delegate from Georgia said the Russian Federation had given an ultimate distortion of the facts on the ground.  The representatives from the occupied regions were at the Geneva process only in their capacity as individuals  and did not represent any entity except themselves. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-08,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gal3476.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. In order to fully defeat terrorism  the international community must confront emerging threats posed by foreign fighters and evolving trends in communication technologies  speakers told the Sixth Committee (Legal) today as deliberations on measures to eliminate international terrorism continued. The threat was growing more sophisticated and complex  as noted by Morocco’s representative  who  troubled by terrorist organizations’ expansion and their use of new technologies to attract adherents  pointed out that there was no longer a prototypical terrorist.  One example of that changing nature was the phenomenon of foreign fighters flowing into Iraq and Syria. Syria’s representative also underscored the reality of foreign fighters  which he said had severely impacted his country.  He welcomed the Fourth Review Conference on the United Nations Global Strategy and its outcome document  which  for the first time  stressed the importance of addressing foreign fighters. Several delegations addressed the use of the internet and media by terrorist organizations  with Sri Lanka’s representative noting that these rapid developments in technology and communications were enabling them both to seduce youth to join their ranks and to seek funding.  Ethiopia’s representative concurred  but added his concern that the global response to that trend had been inadequate. Given such menacing trends in terrorism  many delegations stressed the urgency of finalizing a comprehensive convention.  South Africa’s representative pointed to the 14 years that had passed since negotiations on the definition of terrorism for the draft text began.  “We have reached the point where a decision  one way or the other  must be made.  We either adopt a convention or call it a day ” he urged the Committee. Also speaking today were representatives of Viet Nam  Philippines  Turkey  Montenegro  Israel  Indonesia  Zambia  China  Cuba  Thailand  Peru  Sierra Leone  Gabon  South Sudan  India  Bangladesh  Japan  Eritrea  Algeria and Iraq. The Committee will meet again on 10 a.m. on Thursday  9 October to continue its consideration of measures to eliminate international terrorism and to take up the rule of law. Background The Committee would continue its consideration of the Secretary-General’s report on Measures to eliminate international terrorism.  For background please see Press Release GA/L/3475. Statements YIDNEKACHEW G/MESKEL ZEWDU (Ethiopia)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and African Group  said the international community should be concerned about increasing use by terrorists of new information and communication technologies to spread propaganda.  The global response in that regard had been inadequate.  International  regional and sub-regional organizations should continue to play a key role in promoting counter-terrorism cooperation  while the international community’s joint response must be long-term and multi-pronged to address the various elements of terrorism.  His Government had taken a number of measures to combat terrorism  enacting legislation against terrorism financing  as well as imposing severe penalties against convicted terrorists.  Ethiopia was also engaged in multilateral and regional initiatives  had established joint investigation efforts with neighbouring countries and the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol)  and was party to several agreements on counter-terrorism. PHAM QUANG HIEU (Viet Nam)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  emphasized that the fight against terrorism must be conducted in accordance with the United Nations Charter and international law  and be grounded in the rule of law.  He gave a detailed overview of national efforts on the issue and stressed the importance of regional and international cooperation  noting that Viet Nam actively participated in projects at both platforms.  In addition  his country was party to 12 international instruments on counter-terrorism.  He called for full implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and encouraged Member States to finalize and adopt a draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism. IRENE SUSAN BARREIRO NATIVIDAD (Philippines)  associating her delegation with the Non-Aligned Movement and ASEAN  said that interfaith  interreligious and intercultural dialogue had been a cornerstone in her country’s efforts to suppress and eliminate terrorism.  The Philippines had also enacted legislation against money laundering and terrorism financing.  Currently  before its Congress was draft legislation on strategic trade management involving dual-use goods  the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention.  Grassroots efforts continued to help communities understand and protect themselves against extremist terrorist propaganda.  To raise their security awareness  the Target Hardening Program helped train them to monitor and prevent terrorist attacks against vital installations and critical infrastructures  key economic points  and places of convergence.  The Football for Peace program  which brought together children from conflict areas for sports clinics  also transformed their outlook on life as “a culture of violence” to that of “a culture of peace”. Y. HALIT ÇEVIC (Turkey) said that because international solidarity and cooperation were essential to countering terrorism  his country was actively contributing to capacity-building efforts regionally and internationally  and was party to most United Nations conventions and protocols.  Three areas deserving focus were foreign terrorist fighters  kidnapping for ransom and the increase in violent extremism.  He welcomed the adoption by the Security Council of resolutions 2170 (2014) and 2178 (2014) on those matters.  In addition  there must be greater efforts to resolve conflicts before they attracted extremists.  There must be no safe haven for terrorists.  In that regard  he cited the importance of the principles of “prosecute or extradite”. MILORAD ŠĆEPANOVIĆ (Montenegro)  associating himself with the European Union  said the national actions to combat terrorism  no matter how effective  could not ever be sufficient  noting that his country had participated in multilateral counter-terrorism initiatives.  He expressed strong support for the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force and the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Community.  While there was no military solution against foreign terrorist fighters  he said Security Council resolution 2178 (2014)  of which his country was among the first co-sponsors  served as a valuable tool in fighting international terrorism.  In addition  his Government had actively implemented a criminal code to prescribe penalties for mercenaries.  Nevertheless  he pointed out that all necessary counter-terrorism measures must comply with international humanitarian and refugee law.  Terrorism provided a litmus test for those instruments and the international community must not fail in that regard. MOHAMMED ATLASS (Morocco)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and African Group  expressed alarm at terrorist organizations’ expansion  including by the “Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS)”  and noted that such groups now used all means  including new technologies  to attract adherents.  There was no longer a prototypical terrorist.  His country’s approach was based on optimizing security and standardizing the legal framework  and legislation had been adopted to prevent youth travel to flashpoints.  Morocco was also working with imams from Mali  Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire to teach moderate Islam.  They would return to their countries to teach others  who  in turn  would teach on other parts of the continent.  However  efforts must be redoubled in the Sahel and West Africa to cooperate and coordinate to combat terrorism in the region where a number of groups were affiliated with the “Islamic State”.  The phenomenon of foreign fighters had intensified with flow into Iraq and Syria and  in that regard  he welcomed the unanimous adoption by the Security Council of resolution 2178 (2014). AMIT HEUMANN (Israel) said that the international community had realized the need for a robust strategy to contain the threat posed by radical terrorist groups like ISIS.  The same thinking should apply to State sponsors of terror like Iran  whose “fingerprints” could be found on hundreds of campaigns that had claimed thousands of innocent lives in Africa  Europe and Latin America.  He welcomed the call for renewed efforts to implement the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted this year  as well as the recent adoption of the Security Council resolution on foreign terrorist fighters.  Israel was party to the core universal instruments on counter-terrorism and had implemented Council Resolution 1373 (2001)  the centerpiece of the United Nations efforts to create a robust counter-terrorism regime.  It also adapted legislation to ensure compliance with Council Resolution 1267 (1999) on the establishment of the Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee.  Israel supported a comprehensive convention on international terrorism  with a clear definition of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. JEREMIAH NYAMANE KINGSLEY MAMABOLO (South Africa)  associating himself with the African Group and Non-Aligned Movement  said that while thematic conventions on counter-terrorism were well-received by States  a comprehensive convention dealing with issues of law enforcement in a cross-cutting manner was necessary.  However  since 2000  negotiations on the draft convention had been stuck on which acts were to be excluded from or included in the definition of terrorism.  Alarmed by the seeming inability to make progress  his delegation had suggested  during the Ad Hoc Committee meeting in April 2013  that after 14 years  the time had come to make a decision.  There were three possible options  including agreeing to adopt the convention on the basis of the 2007 text.  The second option  in order to preserve progress achieved  was to “package” a consolidated text including all proposals and recommend a “pause” in the process to the General Assembly.  The final option was to simply concede that there was no consensus and abandon efforts to articulate a convention.  Continuous annual meetings without any substantive discussion or movement would only continue in various for a at great expense if there was no political will to adopt a comprehensive convention.  “We have reached the point where a decision  one way or the other  must be made.  We either adopt a Convention or call it a day ” he stated. DESRA PERCAYA (Indonesia) said that promotion of the value of peace and tolerance must become a priority in international cooperation in order to counter terrorism.  His Government had taken steps to incorporate dialogue between convicted terrorists and moderate clerics into its de-radicalization program.  It hosted the Global Forum of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations in August to nurture tolerance and respect.  The Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy remained the universally accepted framework of international cooperation.  To contribute to the capacity-building of States  the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation had trained more than 15 000 officers from more than 70 countries since its opening in 2004.  ISIL had nothing to do with Islam  and his Government had banned the group as an organization. MWABA PATRICIA KASESE-BOTA (Zambia) said that her country had taken measures to ensure that people and organizations engaging in terrorism would not find a safe haven in its territory  including the adoption of several laws aimed at prohibiting money laundering  protecting whistle blowers  and forfeiting the proceeds from crimes.  Her Government was working to establish a national counter-terrorism center to provide a policy and administrative framework.  The United Nations had developed 18 universal instruments to set a thorough legal framework for combating terrorism.  The international community had also concluded six new counter-terrorism instruments  including one on nuclear terrorism.  But more must be done.  Negotiations on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism  which remained at an impasse  should be concluded. KOUSSAY ABDULJABBAR ALDAHHAK (Syria)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  expressed satisfaction with the Fourth Review Conference on the Global Strategy and its outcome document  which  for the first time  stressed the importance of addressing foreign fighters.  The brutal acts against the people of Syria were being carried out by foreign proxies waging war on behalf of others in foreign lands.  The international community knew well who was furthering those goals  arming  training and sending extremist fighters to Syria  and offering unlimited support.  Other countries then formed a coalition outside the United Nations to fight ISIL.  Despite the situation in his country  Syria continued to fight ISIL  al-Nusra Front and others  and stood ready to fight all forms of international terrorism  provided that it was done with respect for the lives of citizens and for international law.  However  international efforts could not succeed as long as there was a double standard and as long as Israel’s State terrorism perpetrated against the occupied Syrian Golan and other occupied territories continued. WANG MIN (China) said the international community should fully use existing mechanisms to increase international cooperation against terrorism  emphasizing the maintenance of a zero-tolerance stance  with all countries acting together to combat terrorism.  Among other points  he also underscored the strict observation of international law  leveraging the leading role of the United Nations and its Security Council in counter-terrorism cooperation  and improved integrated policy implementation.  His Government had increased its efforts to fight the Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement  the so-called “East Turkistan” terrorist forces  and was accelerating its efforts to create a counter-terrorism law. TANIERIS DIEGUEZ LAO (Cuba)  associating herself with the Non-Aligned Movement and Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  said the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy lacked clear condemnation of unilateral acts committed by specific States and thus gave those States the illegitimate right to justify acts and make politically motivated lists  contrary to international law.  The use of modern technology and communications to promote or commit subversive acts to effect a regime change was also unacceptable and should be rejected by the international community in keeping with international law.  Some States’ practice of financing or promoting intolerant messages of hatred also constituted a breach of the basic principles of the Charter and international law and should be the focus of the international community in combating terrorism.-eob- NORACHIT SINHASENI (Thailand) said his country was fully committed to preventing  combating and eliminating terrorism at the international  regional and domestic levels.  He welcomed the recent unanimous adoption of Security Council resolutions 2170 (2014) and 2178 (2014)  and reaffirmed Thailand’s readiness to implement the two resolutions and other relevant resolutions.  Thailand had ratified nine out of 16 United Nations anti-terrorism conventions and protocols. At the regional level  it worked closely with ASEAN.  The need for a comprehensive convention on international terrorism was more evident than ever.  A final draft of the convention was a prerequisite to convening a High-level conference under United Nations auspices. AUGUSTO THORNBERRY (Peru)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and CELAC  expressed commitment to fighting the scourge in strict compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law.  He urged finalization of a comprehensive convention against terrorism  noting that a definition of terrorism must be hammered out.  Peru had suffered for two decades from violent terrorist groups and had therefore decided to address the conditions that led to terrorism.  Noting that non-governmental organizations and non-profits had been used as fronts in that struggle  he urged such groups to keep terrorists from taking advantage of them for their own purposes.  Expressing concern about foreign combatants  he said they presented a danger to countries of origin  transit and residence. It was vital to take all measures to safeguard the Global Strategy on Terrorism  both nationally and internationally. AMADU KOROMA (Sierra Leone)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and African Group  said that while his delegation recognized the commendable work of the United Nations through entities such as the Centre for Counter-Terrorism  the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force and measures such as General Assembly and Security Council resolutions  it was critical that the source of funding of terrorist organizations be identified and stopped.  Terrorists should also be deprived of easy access to arms and ammunition.  States must strengthen their cooperation and information-sharing on terrorist activities  as well as speed up enactment of robust anti-terrorist legislation.  Efforts to build the capacities of small States in counter-terrorism intelligence and anti-money laundering must be intensified. ANNETTE ANDRÉE ONANGA (Gabon)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and African Group  called for strong and united action from the international community to defeat terrorist groups who desired to control entire States through a reign of terror and disrupt international peace and security.  She expressed support for Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) on foreign terrorist fighters and encouraged States that had not yet done so to ratify all the United Nations protocols and conventions to combat terrorism.  Given the universality of terrorist threats  no nation was protected from the scourge  but there was asymmetry in the ability to fight it.  The perpetrators were able to use sophisticated methods.  In that regard  she appealed for support to African countries. AMANUEL YOANES AJAWIN (South Sudan)  associating himself with the African Group  said that while Member States continued to disagree on semantics in the draft convention  more lives and property would be lost around the world due to acts of terrorism.  In addition to the Lord's Resistance Army  his country was facing a new rebellion under the umbrella of the so-called Sudan People's Liberation Movement in Opposition  which had killed and maimed thousands of innocent civilians across his country.  Stressing that their methods of killing and torturing civilians were the same as those used by terrorist organizations around the world  he called on the international community to condemn the group and that no country provide a safe haven for them.  Furthermore  his Government was extremely concerned by the recent mandate of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS)  which prohibited requests from national and local partners for assistance in capacity-building activities for governmental institutions.  The new mandate would negatively affect the country’s security sector in fighting terrorism. CHAGANTI KOTESWARA RAO (India)  noting that the General Assembly had an important role to play in the fight against international terrorism  said that a comprehensive convention was needed.  Voicing support for the text proposed in 2007 by the coordinator of the Assembly’s Ad Hoc Committee  he said he hoped that all Member States would consider steps to finalize the text during this session.  His country supported all other efforts to strengthen international and regional cooperation and participated in all major global initiatives  including the Financial Action Task Force.  At the national level  India had enacted laws to deal with all aspects of terrorism  including the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act  The Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention) Act  and the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act. A.K. ABDUL MOMEN (Bangladesh)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and OIC  noted that his country had not experienced any terrorist attacks for six years.  It was party to 14 universal anti-terrorism instruments and currently implementing a national counter-radicalization strategy through education  job opportunities for youth  women’s empowerment and the promotion of moderate values.  All branches of law enforcement had been strengthened  as well.  Supporting the conclusion of the draft convention  he called for consensus on the definition of terrorism.  The text should also address the root causes of terrorism.  Promoting a culture of peace and unity in diversity was an effective way to defeat terrorism. “[W]e need more than ever before harmony  understanding and mutual respect for all cultures and peoples and accept their diversities ” he stressed. PALITHA KOHONA (Sri Lanka)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that ISIS had “jolted terrorism back to the […] centre of our attention ” but noted that they had not invented terrorist violence and brutality; they had borrowed from existing methods.  His own country had experienced terrorism for three decades from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam  which had refined suicide technology.  Rapid developments in technology and communications were used by many terrorist groups seduce youth to join their ranks and seek funding.  Media should be better used to counter the narrative propagated by terrorist groups  and States should work with credible partners with influence in the religious groups with which terrorists have claimed affiliation to discredit their narrative.  Socio-economic factors creating the hopelessness that spawned terrorist sympathizers must also be addressed.  A comprehensive convention was urgently needed to clarify a unified strategy to confront the problem. KAITARO NONOMURA (Japan) said that ISIL demonstrated that global terrorist threats had been proliferating despite international efforts  and posed serious threats to the international order.  To counter terrorism  measures were needed to block terrorist financing and establish effective border control.  To that end  his country was implementing capacity-building programmes in North Africa  Sahel and the Middle East  which should strengthen governance in those regions to prevent violent extremism from taking root.  Japan was also enhancing its counter-terrorism dialogue with ASEAN.  He stressed the importance of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism and expressed the expectation that there would be an early conclusion to negotiations for the draft convention with a view to complementing existing counter-terrorism conventions. GIRMA ASMEROM (Eritrea)  associating himself with the African Group and Non-Aligned Movement  said his country  50 per cent Muslim and 50 per cent Christian  remained peaceful and stable in the volatile Horn of Africa by pursuing a policy centred on inclusion.  Eritrea was party to relevant regional conventions  among them the Community of Sahel Saharan States Convention on Mutual Assistance in Security Matters  which allowed members to take stringent measures to prevent terrorism.  In addition  his country had co-sponsored the recently adopted Security Council resolution on combating foreign terrorist fighters.  He stressed the need for cooperation in sharing information and exchange of best practices.  All four pillars of the Global Strategy must receive equal emphasis and resources.  Long-standing conflicts and unjust sanctions against developing countries should also be addressed as part of overall strategy. FETHI METREF (Algeria)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  underscoring the need to agree upon a definition of terrorism  said any confusion between acts of terrorism and the legitimate struggle of peoples under colonial or foreign occupation to achieve their inalienable right to self-determination in accordance with United Nations documents should be avoided.  A High-level conference should be convened to formulate a common stand to eradicate terrorism  which would also contribute to overcoming the remaining outstanding issues to reaching the required consensus on a text.  The Global Strategy must be kept relevant in light of emerging threats and evolving trends.  He welcomed progress made in prohibiting the payment of ransoms and other means of financing terrorism.  Algeria was also contributing to stabilizing and promoting peace in the Maghreb  the North of Mali and the Sahel region. AMMAR AL-KHALIDY (Iraq) said that ISIL had carried out barbarous acts against Iraqis and had destroyed sacred sites.  His country valued the efforts of the Security Council  especially resolutions 2170 (2014) and 2178 (2014) against ISIL and appreciated international initiatives and conferences that had provided counter-terrorism support to his country.  However  despite United Nations efforts over several decades in studying and combating terrorism  it still brutally attacked various countries in the world  especially his.  That had led his country to seek and identify reasons for continued acts of terrorism.  It was important to agree upon a definition of terrorism in order to unite international efforts in formulating comprehensive measures to study its causes and eradicate it.  He expressed hope that the recent Baghdad conference on counter-terrorism as well as the one to be held next year would serve as important occasions to study the topic. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-08,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaspd.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Speakers painted a harrowing picture of deprivation and distress on the ground and also offered glimmers of hope today as the Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) heard from a broad range of representatives and petitioners on behalf of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Fabian Picardo  Chief Minister of Gibraltar  and Cynthia Ligeard  President of New Caledonia  addressing the Committee  cited the progress made by their respective territories towards ensuring self-determination  while also pointing to challenges ahead. Petitioners from both territories reflected a breadth of sentiments  with those from New Caledonia representing voices in favour of full independence  as well as for continued association with the administering Power.  Echoing comments by Mr. Picardo  a petitioner for Gibraltar added that young Gibraltarians wondered why Spain  despite being a vibrant democracy and responsible international stakeholder  did not support their aspirations for self-determination.  “Gibraltarians  no matter how long it takes  would keep pressing their right to be recognized as a people who were free to choose their own destiny ” he said. A petitioner from French Polynesia underscored the long-term environmental and health risks from France’s now-discontinued nuclear testing  while another insisted on greater global action to force the administering Power to meet its international obligations. The bulk of today’s petitioners spoke on Western Sahara  reflecting a diversity of views on existing realities and on the ways ahead.  One speaker held Frente Polisario mainly responsible for the persistent deadlock  especially amid the absence of freedom to choose  adding that Morocco  while not blameless  deserved a fair hearing on its proposal for a settlement. Another petitioner from Algeria  criticizing Morocco’s effort to skirt its international responsibilities  said vulnerable people  including children  were being victimized merely for seeking their legitimate rights. A speaker said she came to the United Nations as a spokesperson and woman to plead the cause of the Saharan people  both at a psychological and humanitarian level  while another stressed the role of self-reliance and personal responsibility in removing the “victim mentality” that fostered hatred and resentment.  Yet  another petitioner called for concerted action to prevent further destabilization of the region. The session opened with a statement by the representative of Spain  who  reaffirming his Government’s support for the general principle of decolonization  said “colonialism by consent” was unacceptable as it sought to perpetuate itself regardless of United Nations criteria. Following him was the representative of Papua New Guinea  who emphasized that the millions of people living under the intolerable yolk of colonialism must not be left behind as a new sustainable development paradigm was formulated for the decades ahead.  Referring specifically to New Caledonia  he said leaders there needed to use their positions wisely to fulfil the people’s aspirations  while the international community should address major concerns over the electoral process. The representatives of the United Kingdom and Spain exercised their right of reply. The Fourth Committee will meet again at 3 p.m. on Thursday  9 October  to continue hearing petitioners on Western Sahara. Background The Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) met this afternoon to continue consideration of decolonization issues  for which it was scheduled to hear from representatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories and petitioners.  For further background  see Press Release GA/SPD/554 of 7 October. Statements JOSÉ JAVIER GUTIÉRREZ BLANCO NAVARRETE (Spain)  reaffirming his Government’s support for the general principle of decolonization  said “colonialism by consent” was unacceptable as it sought to perpetuate itself regardless of United Nations criteria.  He added that Spain did not cede territorial waters  and thus  could not be accused of “illegal incursions” by Britain.  Spain would not accept the perpetuation of the present situation.   He called for a solution that included restitution of territory transferred by the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713  as well as areas later illegally occupied by the United Kingdom. While insisting that the interests of the population of Gibraltar must be taken into account  he said Gibraltar could not be a party in the dialogue on sovereignty between Spain and the United Kingdom  which he called the only two competent parties in that regard according to the established principles of the United Nations.  He maintained that unilateral and provocative actions taken by the Gibraltarian local authorities  which inconvenienced inhabitants while the administering Power stood idly by  made it even more urgent to put an end to the colonial situation.  It was necessary to achieve a political solution that took into account the particularities of the case through bilateral negotiation with the United Kingdom. ROBERT GUBA AISI (Papua New Guinea) said that the millions of people living under the intolerable yolk of colonialism must not be left behind as a new sustainable development paradigm was formulated for the decades ahead.  Respect for self-determination of all peoples was recognized by the United Nations as paramount.  The stalling process had renewed a sense of urgency on the matter.  He called for sustained efforts to make self-determination a living reality for New Caledonia through an inclusive process that led to a durable settlement.  He added that New Caledonian leaders needed to use their positions wisely to fulfil the people’s aspirations. He said there was major concern over the electoral process in New Caledonia that should be addressed ahead of the scheduled referendum by everyone  including the administering Power  in the interest of a fair and transparent outcome.  Lauding France’s cooperative spirit on the self-determination of the territory  he called for greater efforts for the dissemination of information on developments there.  It was also crucial to ensure that migration of people into the territory did not undermine the interests of the indigenous people  he added. Petitioners on the Question of Gibraltar FABIAN PICARDO  Chief Minister of Gibraltar  cited a report from the office of the Deputy Chief Minister of Gibraltar that gave details on what he called “politically motivated queues  artificially created by the Spanish Government” that affected 10 000 Spanish and European citizens crossing the border between Gibraltar and Spain for work every day.  He said that there had been 245 “illegal” incursions by Spanish vessels into what he labelled British Gibraltar territorial waters  the de facto value of which was to assist the Spanish Government to claim sovereignty of the waters around Gibraltar.  Spain had turned down the chance to issue a claim on the waters at the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea in 1966  but was now prosecuting a case by illegal incursions. Stating that gangs in the Strait of Gibraltar were transporting cannabis and cocaine from North Africa into Spain  he requested the Spanish government to cooperate with Gibraltar on law enforcement.  Gibraltar  he said  would stick to the jurisdiction of territorial waters as defined by the map of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  as well as the United Nations designation of sovereign rights. Spain  he said  wished to take over the sovereignty of Gibraltar  but “does not even allow for the consent of the people of Gibraltar to be expressed”.  However  he maintained  the people of Gibraltar were the “only relevant decision makers” in regard to their self-determination.  Gibraltar would like to work with national  regional and municipal authorities to promote business opportunities in the Bay of Gibraltar  transforming it into an “arc of prosperity” for both sides.  Calling for political reconciliation  he proposed ad hoc talks with the United Kingdom in parallel with the trilateral forum  in order to kick-start dialogue. RICHARD BUTTIGIEG of the Self-Determination of Gibraltar Group requested the international community’s support for the realization of Gibraltar’s right to self-determination.  He said young Gibraltarians wondered why Spain  despite being a vibrant democracy and responsible international stakeholder  did not support their aspirations.  Gibraltarians  no matter how long it took  would keep pressing their right to be recognized as a people who were free to choose their own destiny.  The rights of all people  no matter how small  to live in freedom and dignity must be respected  he stressed. Petitioners on the Question of New Caledonia CYNTHIA LIGEARD  President of the Government of New Caledonia  said that responsibility-sharing was not self-evident  nor had there been a convergence of common desires.  Following the elections of 11 May  the transfer of competency and genuine autonomy were progressing rapidly  including in the areas of civil and commercial law  education and civil security.  The March 1999 emancipation process had now covered all of the competencies due to be transferred.  Nevertheless  the tension persisted.  Caledonian citizenship could not be built on exclusion.  “We need to find a dignified path ” she added.  Cultural values must be allowed to flourish  and “bridges” between common law and customary law needed to be built.  The fiscal system was rebuilt  and two months after the Government’s installation  efforts were made to improve cost of living and better distribute wealth.  The Government had undertaken efforts for “social insertion”.  Additionally  a global transport scheme was being finalized.  The triple identity of French  Indonesian and Polynesian had been recognized  she said  voicing hope for sharing a common future. DANIEL GOA  Front de Liberation Nationale Kanak et Socialiste  said the Kanak people were determined to exercise their right to self-determination.  However  he said  the road was difficult because of electoral fraud  illegal exploitation of natural resources and other activities of the administering Power.  He urged the United Nations to initiate mediation with France on eliminating colonialism. ROCH WAMYTAN  UC-FLNKS and Nationalists Group  explaining his organization’s decision to boycott the 1984 elections  sought conditions for a free and fair vote that would truly reflect the aspirations of the people. Activities such as liquidation of independence leaders and illegal settlement of migrants had made New Caledonia’s Kanak people minorities in their own country.  The time had come to ask the United Nations for official mediation with France to ensure that the 2018 election took place in optimal conditions. PHILIPPE DUNOYER  Pour Caledonie Ensemble  speaking at the United Nations for the first time on behalf of people advocating against independence  said efforts should be accelerated to integrate the people of New Caledonia  instead of fostering divisions.  The road to full emancipation could be traversed only through the participation of all stakeholders in New Caledonia and should include all options  ranging from independence to association. Petitioners for French Polynesia MANUTAHI TEMARU OSCAR  Tavini Huiraatira  UPLD  recalled that  just after the re-inscription of French Polynesia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories on 17 May  thousands of people moved through villages of Tahiti to commemorate that event  which allowed them to start the process of self-determination  under United Nations’ auspices.  He took note of the June resolution of the Special Committee on Decolonization  which recognized the inalienable right of the people to self-determination and to control their natural resources.  France created a special committee on strategic minerals in which the residents of French Polynesia “have no say” and were “bound to become the powerless spectators”.  Job seekers would saturate the French Polynesian job market and leave its people with the scraps.  Their brothers from New Caledonia had learned that first hand when vast amounts of nickel were found.  The rules  in the context of self-determination  needed to be clearly defined. CHARLES BROTHERSON MOETAI said that  as deputy mayor of Faa’a  French Polynesia’s biggest city  he witnessed daily the unilateral definition and application of both electoral laws and organizing laws governing operations in the communes.  The Code Général des Collectivités Territoriales did not consider his people’s needs  while the electoral laws were defined  voted upon  updated and applied unilaterally from Paris  without local consent.  French Polynesia was under the United Nations decolonization process  which obliged administering Powers to prepare territories for full self-government  consistent with international law.  However  the administering Power had not transmitted information on the territory this year  pursuant to its Charter obligations.  He called on the United Nations to visit the territory. RICHARD ARIIHAU TUHEIAVA  Tavini Huiraatira  No Te Ao Maohi  FLP  referring to the relevant United Nations reports  including on environmental health and the impact of nuclear testing  said he was disappointed that the last report had been published “strategically”  as the people of the territory were deprived of a chance to provide their views.  A 1996 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) study said the impact of nuclear testing on the people was negligible  yet the testing in the area involved one of the largest release of radioactive materials.  It had been 17 years since France’s last nuclear test  but the people were still living with the legacy of hundreds.  There were long-term health and environmental effects  he said  drawing attention to an independent expert scientific report on nuclear testing  which Member States would find useful.  He requested the United Nations’ assistance in connection with the impact of nuclear testing. Petitioners for Western Sahara ERIC CAMERON  World Action for Refugees  spoke of the abysmal human rights situation in the camps.  He said the Frente Popular para la Liberación de Saguia el-Hamra y de Río de Oro (Frente Polisario) was mainly responsible for the persistent deadlock  especially amid the absence of freedom to choose.  Morocco was not blameless either  he said  adding that the country had nevertheless undergone changes in recent times.  Morocco had forwarded a proposal for a settlement and the Frente Polisario should allow the Saharan population to make their voice heard on the matter. ANDREW M. ROSEMARINE said Morocco’s 2007 autonomy proposal offered the best solution to the Moroccan Saharan dispute.  It was “fair  flexible and far-sighted”  as it combined a large degree of self-determination for Saharans with an emphasis on negotiations.  Parties could tailor their claims to their needs.  Further  Saharans could run their affairs democratically through legislative  executive and judicial bodies  as well as have the financial resources for the region’s development.  Morocco could be trusted to deliver on those issues. ANDREA MARGELLETTI  President  Center for International Studies  reflected on the war in Mali and the uprising of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham  illustrating two common points:  the socioeconomic marginalization and its transformation to Jihad; and the support of tribal and clan networks that had found in extremism a chance to make their voices heard.  The same threat to global stability in the Middle East could occur in North Africa and in the Sahel.  Before becoming military  those crises were primarily social and political  and in that context  he said respect for human rights and the promotion of self-determination appeared to be the way towards national reconciliation.  That could be the response to many African geopolitical scenarios.  However  only compromise with Governments and a common agenda between the parties would lead to a full and mature realization of mutual goals. NANCY HUFF  Teach the Children International  said that  as the world engaged in shuttle diplomacy  people on the ground continued to suffer.  Self-reliance and personal responsibility would go far towards removing the “victim mentality” that fostered hatred and resentment.  Victims would continue to search for ways to prove they were victims  even by manufacturing them.  The Morocco Saharans stood by and watched while their counterparts in Tindouf voiced their self-imposed exile cry that they were victims of their conflict.  When the Saharans learn to take responsibility for their situation and start to improve their lives  they would begin to heal and would reach out in peace to their brothers and sisters.  The world must give Morocco’s proposal a chance to grant autonomy to Western Sahara. SMAIL DEBECHE  Algerian National Committee of Solidarity with Western Sahara People  said that no United Nations member recognized Morocco’s occupation of Western Sahara.  Morocco was against any meaningful progress for a free  fair and transparent referendum  having violated international law in the exploitation of resources and military oppression in the occupied territory.  The people of Western Sahara were waiting for the United Nations to put into action its resolutions and decisions for self-determination and a referendum.  Morocco had no claim to sovereignty over Western Sahara  he said  noting that the Moroccan proposal for self-autonomy in itself was a recognition that the people of Western Sahara had their own identity. GALE SHERRILL  Common Ground Ministries  urged the world’s intelligent and reasonable people to help to relocate the Saharan people from the camps in Algeria to homes in Morocco.  The United Nations should focus its money and talent on ending the unreasonable confinement and containment of Saharans in Algeria.  Morocco had opened the door to their return and the United Nations should do its utmost to foster the process for the sake of the people; it was common sense. DONNA SAMS  Antioch Community Church  requested assistance for the Saharan people in Tindouf  as well as in Morocco  citing prevalent reports that education in the camps had declined.  Each year the United Nations delayed a decision on Western Sahara  the children in the camps suffered  with many going without an education.  She urged the United Nations to become a key player in building schools  so that education was available to every child in the camps.  As for the Frente Polisario practice of allowing only one family member at a time to participate in United Nations confidence-building measures  she said visits were termed “family visits”  and as such  entire families should be allowed to participate in a single visit. MHAND BERKOUK  Algerian Foundation for Strategic and Security Studies  said Morocco had unlawfully occupied Western Sahara for 39 years  underlining that no international organization recognized its sovereignty.  Africa had been “intransigent” in defending the right of the Saharan people to independence and emancipation  with the Organization of African Unity having recognized the “Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic” as a member since the early 1980s.  Yet  Morocco continued with extra-judicial killings and torture  and “generous” spending on its military to quell the Saharan’s peaceful struggle for independence.  Such moves could push disillusioned Saharan youth towards armed resistance.  United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) should be enabled to organize a referendum for self-determination and equipped with a legal instrument to monitor human rights violations.  The Security Council should adopt a resolution pressing Morocco to be more proactive in negotiations with Frente Polisario. JEANETTE JOY HOORN called for concerted action to prevent further destabilization of the Sahel region.  Algeria faced challenges from terrorism  which risked radicalizing the refugee camps.  Already beset by environmental degradation  poverty and malnutrition  the Sahel was now threatened by terrorist groups  as well as arms and drug traffickers.  Weak and porous borders had exacerbated the instability  and poorly functioning markets had made households vulnerable.  The international community should build a regional platform to address the challenges  given their magnitude.  Morocco’s efforts in that direction had been recognized by the United Nations and should be encouraged. ALI SAHEL  National Association for Youth Exchange  said the Saharan people were having a difficult time  with young people suffering painful consequences and an uncertain fate.  It was important to find a solution.  The hopes prompted by the ceasefire turned out to be an illusion and the insurrection of 2010 along with other demonstrations had been repressed with bloodshed and abuse measures like torture by the Moroccan authorities.  The basic needs of the population in the camps were not being met.  Among other ills  there had also been a significant drop in employment among the Saharan youth.  Ninety per cent left school after primary education; they took refuge in the deserts because of persecution  and were subjected to other precarious situations  all because the Moroccan occupation starved and terrorised them.  That policy also aimed to implant occupation in the minds of the young people and to kill any hope of a peaceful solution. HASSIBA BOULMERKA said she came to the United Nations to please the cause of the Saharan people  both at a psychological and humanitarian level.  As a sportsperson and as a woman  she said she hoped to raise her voice against the illegal occupation by Morocco and the fostering of a referendum that would allow the people to exercise their right to self-determination.  Saharan women  despite their extremely difficult circumstances  continued to practise civilized and democratic behaviour even in the camps  facing their oppression with grace and fortitude.  The residents of the camps looked upon visitors with great aspiration and anticipation  she said  urging the international community to restore the Saharan’s hope and confidence in themselves and humanity. SAID AYACHI  Algerian National Committee of Solidarity with the Sahrawi People  said all human rights violations in Western Sahara had been committed by Morocco  which had forced the Saharan people to endure arbitrary detentions  rapes and forced disappearances.  In 2014 alone  some 23 foreigners  including jurists and observers from non-governmental organizations  had been brutally repressed by Moroccan police at the territory’s entrance.  By signing the ceasefire agreement in 1991  the Saharan people had expressed their confidence in the United Nations  which had determined that a referendum on self-determination should be held in 1992.  He called for widening the mandate of MINURSO to enforce human rights and organize a referendum as soon as possible. BABACAR DIALLO said the Saharan-Moroccan conflict was manipulated by Frente Polisario and was a factor in the destabilization of the entire region and all countries in Africa.  No international organization except the African Union recognized that.  The activities of Frente Polisario  sponsored by Algeria  were a main source of destabilization in the Maghreb area and in the Sahara.  Algeria must assume its responsibility and find a realistic process.  The Security Council must also assume its responsibility in the conflict. AMY KARIMI  The Pacis Group  urged action to address the needs of people in the Tindouf camps.  “These persons desperately need your intervention ” she said  especially women imprisoned in unacceptable conditions for the “crime” of sexual relations outside of marriage.  She urged reclassification of sex outside of marriage  as it concerned rights of women over their bodies.  The Frente Polisario leadership systematically violated the rights of Saharan women and girls  some as young as 13 years old  by forcing them to marry.  There had also been reports of forced pregnancy.  She strongly urged the United Nations to investigate  report and take action on those matters. ABDELHAKIM BETTACHE  Assemblee Populaire Communale d’Alger Centre  described the Fourth Committee as the principal forum to mobilize energies to ensure the respect and fulfilment of the right to self-determination.  He emphasized Algeria’s stand on the full application of international law and criticized Morocco’s effort to skirt its responsibility.  Vulnerable people  including children  were being victimized merely for seeking the legitimate rights  he said  urging the United Nations to force Morocco to fulfil its obligations.  There was an urgent need to establish a mechanism to protect the human rights of the Saharan people. Right of Reply The representative of the United Kingdom  speaking in exercise of the right of reply  recalled that the sovereignty of his Government over Gibraltar and its territorial waters was recognized by the United Nations.  The people of Gibraltar enjoyed the right to self-determination and their relationship with his Government could not be characterized as colonialism.  The United Kingdom would not enter into a process of negotiation on sovereignty that was not acceptable to Gibraltar.  The tripartite forum remained the right platform for resolving the issue and he regretted that Spain had withdrawn from the talks in 2011.  The United Kingdom sought constructive movement between ad hoc officials  to fully reflect the interests and rights of the people of Gibraltar.  Gibraltar’s active participation in any dialogue was non-negotiable.  The United Kingdom rejected the accusation that it illegally occupied Gibraltar and its waters.  A State that was sovereign over its land was sovereign over its sea  extending to three miles.  He drew attention to several tax agreements and proposals of Gibraltar  to which Spain had not replied.  He also highlighted the conclusions of the report of the European Anti-Fraud Office concerning cigarette smuggling over the Spain-Gibraltar border  and noted the disproportionate waiting time for workers at the border. The representative of Spain  also speaking in exercise of the right of reply  said his delegation’s position was based on the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht.  Spain did not recognize that the United Kingdom had the right to land and maritime areas  which only the city and the state of Gibraltar were accorded.  Spain had no doubts about the extent of its territories  and its boats would continue to exercise their rights as they had done “since time immemorial”.  The attitude of the Gibraltar authorities had been confrontational  and they had sought to prevent the Spanish fisherman from fishing.  Spain was currently working with the United Kingdom on regional cooperation schemes  in a process that included the local authorities of Gibraltar. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-08,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gashc4098.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The biggest problem facing young people around the world — in developing and developed countries — was unemployment and underemployment  youth representatives told the Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) as it concluded its general discussion on social development  with lively contributions from a number of delegates  many of whom had grown up alongside the Millennium Development Goals. Young people from around the world spoke candidly about the obstacles that they faced  with several speakers lamenting that youth had not been given their due roles in public life.  A youth delegate from Finland noted that after 15 years of implementing the Millennium Goals  less than one fifth of Finnish young people had ever heard of them.  When asked about the future they wanted  they described a fair and equal world  where people were judged by their skills.  “Ideology and religion are not the leading factors behind radicalization of youth ” he stressed.  “Much more important is the lack of economic and social opportunities.” Some speakers focused on national challenges.  Two youth delegates from Sri Lanka spoke about the tribulations of a country emerging from three decades of conflict.  Noting a disparity in resource distribution between rural and urban areas and the burden of conflict on women  they called on the international community to “rethink structural dominance and power relationships”. Knowledge was power  some speakers said.  A youth delegate from Belgium said many children and young people were unaware of the existence of their rights and lacked full and equal access to the information that would allow them to seek help when their rights were violated.  Many youth  including girls and lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender (LGBT) children  faced social limits and exclusion at schools. Romania’s delegate pointed to an outdated education system structure  where accumulation of information had replaced gaining knowledge.  “We dream of an education that nurtures critical thinking and creativity ” she said  because those were the qualities employers sought. Agreeing that education was crucial to achieving the Millennium Goals  several delegates reported on the strides made.  A speaker from the Dominican Republic said the country was investing heavily in education  with 4 per cent of its gross domestic product allocated to education and an expansion of school infrastructure.  By the end of 2014  the country could declare itself “free of illiteracy”  he said. Along similar lines  a representative of Lesotho noted that his country had the highest literacy rates in Southern Africa.  Nepal’s speaker praised his country’s policy of providing positive discrimination in the form of quotas in education to ensure that all children  particularly girls  children in difficult circumstances and those belonging to ethnic minorities  had access to free and compulsory education.  Despite that progress  many challenges remained  he said  joining other delegates in calling on the international community to place the unfinished Millennium Development Goals at the top of the post-2015 agenda. Also speaking today were the representatives of Austria  Egypt  Iraq  Belarus  Mongolia  Kuwait  Pakistan  Suriname  Zimbabwe  Bulgaria  Peru  Turkey  Republic of Moldova  Norway  China  Paraguay  Viet Nam  Ecuador  Bangladesh  Malta  Saudi Arabia  Germany  Bolivia  Honduras  Panama  Algeria  Kenya  Albania  Nigeria  Burkina Faso  Botswana  Ukraine  Republic of Korea  Chile  Georgia  Maldives  Eritrea  United Republic of Tanzania  Sudan  El Salvador  Yemen  Kyrgyzstan and Argentina. Also delivering a statement was a representative of the International Labour Organization (ILO). The Third Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Thursday  9 October  to take up the issues of crime prevention and international drug control. Background The Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian & Cultural) met this morning to continue its debate on social development.  For background  see Press Release GA/SHC/4097. Statements LYDIA WALTER  a youth delegate from Austria  said that the paramount importance of education could not be emphasized enough.  Educational institutions of any kind fulfilled a crucial role in bringing change because they fostered critical reflection and constructive action.  “The society I am envisioning does not exclude any groups” for reasons such as their sexual orientation or gender identity  she stressed.  It was also crucial to encourage tolerance to erase borders that provoked armed conflict and indifference.  Calling on the international community to rethink the global economic system and face the drastic consequences of environmental degradation  she concluded that there could be no peace  prosperity or progress without the full and equal participation of people all over the world. OSAMA ABDELKHALEK MAHMOUD (Egypt)  aligning his delegation with the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  said empowerment should be at the centre of social development.  Identifying a need for an effective strategy to enable people to empower themselves  he said the right to social development was central in Egypt and benefitted all  including vulnerable groups  with increases made to minimum wages and social allowances.  Turning to persons with disabilities  he said a database had been established to identify them and address their needs.  On families  he noted their important role in eradicating poverty.  Regarding the ageing population  he called on the United Nations to mainstream their needs.  Recognizing the importance of youth  he outlined national policies targeting development  employment  literacy and capacity development.  In closing  he highlighted the situation of people living under foreign occupation and the need to include the effects of terrorism in social development discussions.  YAHYA AL-OBAIDI (Iraq)  aligning his delegation with the statement delivered on behalf of the “Group of 77”  said his country was committed to promoting prosperity for citizens and ensuring that they were at the forefront of its policies.  National efforts were under way to ensure housing  health care  social security and equal opportunity for all.  Over the last decade  Iraq had adopted legislation that focused on dignity of life as a basis for social development.  Social services were provided for families  older people and persons with disabilities.  In order to help young people  Iraq had established professional training centres to enable them to create their own businesses.  Iraq had also ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  By reforming national institutions  the Government was trying to bridge the gap between common practice and the post-2015 agenda goals.  Terrorism was a big challenge in Iraq  he said  as it targeted State infrastructure as well as private institutions.  As a result  he concluded  Iraq would continue to fight terrorism side by side with developing social welfare policies. EMILY KELLY  a youth delegate from the Dominican Republic  said that it was time to reset priorities and put social development at the forefront of the United Nations agenda.  Poverty eradication was the most urgent international requirement.  In order to achieve this goal  the Dominican Republic was investing heavily in education and had allocated 4 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) to education  which had led to an expansion of school infrastructure.  By the end of 2014  the country could declare itself “free of illiteracy”  with the Secretary-General having chosen the Dominican Republic as a champion in the campaign for global education.  In closing  she welcomed the nomination of an independent expert on the rights of older persons  adding that a global legal instrument was necessary to protect the rights of the ageing population. JOEL LINNAINMÄKI  a youth delegate from Finland  said after fifteen years of implementing the Millennium Development Goals  less than one fifth of Finnish young people had ever heard of them.  When asked about the future they wanted  they described a fair and equal world  free from threats of violence and climate change  where people were judged by personality and skills.  He mentioned UN-Women’s HeForShe campaign and asked that all business be green in the future.  “Ideology and religion are not the leading factors behind radicalization of youth ” he continued.  “Much more important is the lack of economic and social opportunities.”  Calling for a permanent forum on youth  he asked for the empowerment of young people from developing countries. VALENTIN RYBAKOV (Belarus) said transitional social policies had been set up  where the responsibility was shared between citizens and the State.  Faced with an increased life expectancy  the need for active labour and ensuring a decent life was of pivotal importance.  To address those and related issues  the country had pursued national strategies for social development  redistribution of social expenditure  developing entrepreneurship and establishing new jobs.  Turning to the Millennium Development Goals  he informed that the share of the population living under the poverty level dropped to 5 per cent in 2014 from 40 per cent in 2002.  Other initiatives revolved around providing quality health and education and homes for older persons and persons with disabilities.  Noting that every fourth citizen was a young person  he emphasized the importance of providing education  health services  jobs and housing to empower the youth to participate in the economic  social and political development of the country. OCHIR ENKHTSETSEG (Mongolia) said promoting the empowerment of people to work towards achieving poverty eradication  social integration and full employment and decent work for all was a pressing issue.  Stressing the importance of investing in essential social services and social protection  improving access to decent work  promoting open and inclusive institutions  and transparency and accountability  she highlighted national efforts aimed at empowering people through increased public participation  information and communications technology (ICT) development  improved access to decent work and education.  Further  she said the Government had launched the national “An Employed Mongolian with a Job and Income” programme  which created 34 000 jobs and provided vocational training for unemployed middle-aged and young people. ALIA ABDULLAH A Y ALMUZAINI (Kuwait)  aligning her delegation with the statement delivered on behalf of the “Group of 77”  said societies were duty-bound to provide an environment of equal opportunity to all citizens and to build transparent institutions.  “Kuwaiti society was governed by solidarity and dependence ” she said  noting that her Government had earmarked over $70 billion in the 2013-14 budget for general services  with the largest share going to social and health services.  Commensurate with the Secretary-General’s recommendations in his report on ageing  Kuwait was dedicated to protecting the rights of this vulnerable group.  Guardians of older persons were penalized if they abused or neglected their commitments.  Further  in order to integrate people with disabilities into society  Kuwait had undertaken several projects  including the “Journey of Hope”  which was a maritime voyage that sailed from Kuwait to 19 States  with a crew that included people with Down syndrome.  As the world celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the Year of the Family  Kuwait continued to stress the importance of families and the work-life balance.  In particular  women in Kuwait were given many special privileges  such as maternity leave and time off for breastfeeding. SAHEBZADA AHMED KHAN (Pakistan) said that the empowerment of people was a key enabler in the process of poverty eradication and social integration.  Committed to realizing the objectives of the World Summit for Social Development  known as the Copenhagen Summit  to build a just and prosperous society for all its citizens without any discrimination  he said Pakistan had put socioeconomic development at the heart of the Government’s national agenda.  Concluding  he said Pakistan had taken several steps to address the growing needs of its more than 11.6 million senior citizens  as respect and reverence for the elderly was part and parcel of their sociocultural ethos. RAYNEESH HARIBHAJAN  a youth delegate from Suriname  said that the National Youth Parliament had taken a number of steps towards achieving participation in capacity-building and skills training for youth.  In addition  there had been discussions with the Ministry of Education to evaluate and amend school regulations to make them more child-friendly  provide recommendations on improving access to ICT and to establish a confidential hotline for youth to call on any matter affecting them.  Further  Suriname had played an active role in building a bridge between the youth of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR).  Concluding  he underlined his country’s positive experiences and his willingness to share them with the international community. FREDERICK MUSIIWA MAKAMURE SHAVA (Zimbabwe) said that meaningful development should include all people and should strive to lessen inequalities rather than widen them.  With that in mind  he said that since independence  Zimbabwe’s development policies were geared towards achieving economic empowerment and independence for its citizens.  Recognizing that policies that prioritized investments in social services  including education and health  were critical in laying a sound foundation for vibrant economies  he emphasized Zimbabwe’s commitment to ensure that every Zimbabwean had access to education.  In conclusion  he hoped that the post-2015 development agenda would answer the development aspirations of millions of people who were looking to delegates to set strong normative standards for the development of their nations and societies. RADINA KOLEVA and ANI KOLEVA  youth delegates from Bulgaria  said that young representatives had advocated for active youth participation in the decision-making process on pertinent social issues.  Non-formal education was a key tool to integrate young people with disabilities and to reduce the rate of youth unemployment.  In addition  they hoped the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda would include ambitious yet achievable goals and clear quantifiable milestones to measure its successful implementation.  Stressing that unemployment was one of the main challenges for young people  they underlined that education should not be taken for granted. AUGUSTO THORNBERRY (Peru) said that in 2011  his country had established the Ministry for Social Inclusion and Development to implement and administer public policies to combat poverty and inequality.  The Ministry had produced a national strategy that identified priority areas  such as child nutrition  early child development  economic inclusion and the protection of older persons  he said  noting that “it is clear that economic growth is no guarantor for social inclusion.”  Economic development and social inclusion required a stable political environment and  therefore  each year  Peru had increased the budget allocated to social investments.  Noting that national efforts required a favourable international environment to be successful  he called on States  the United Nations system and international financial institutions to bolster cooperation in consolidating social inclusion policies in developing countries. MAHISHAA BALRAJ  a youth delegate from Sri Lanka  said young people faced multiple challenges as the country recovered from a 30-year armed conflict.  She and other youth delegates had travelled across their island to engage in consultations to capture the thoughts and aspirations of young people.  Since Sri Lanka provided a state-funded education for all  the 92 per cent literacy rate for boys and 90 per cent for girls were among the best in the developing world.  The biggest challenge now was the disparity in resource distribution between rural and urban areas.  Unemployment and underemployment was another challenge to youth  both in developing and developed countries.  As skills development was a critical need  Sri Lanka had combined the ministerial portfolios of youth affairs and skill development. SENEL WANNIARACHCHI  a youth delegate from Sri Lanka  said that he was born 22 years ago in a conflict-scarred island where his mother had fought a lonely battle to raise two children.  Women and girls around the world faced many structural barriers  he said  highlighting that it was crucial to rethink the way the international community viewed structural dominance and power relationships.  Expressing solidarity with UN-Women’s HeForShe campaign  he vowed to take its message of gender equality to men and boys in cities and villages nationwide.  While it was a matter of pride that girls were actually performing better in Sri Lanka and the world’s first elected female President was Sri Lankan  it was also important to do much more to ensure that more women were represented adequately in the public sphere. YIGIT CANAY (Turkey) recognized social development as the core of any development efforts.  The recent steady growth had allowed the country to focus on social development issues  with achievements centred on eliminating extreme poverty and gender inequality and ensuring universality of primary education.  Yet despite progress made  challenges remained  especially concerning persons with disabilities and a need to raise awareness on rights of older persons.  Social development would be incomplete without addressing issues including women rights and youth employment.  Central to that endeavour was equal access to education to combat discrimination and improving knowledge of human rights. KELEBONE MAOPE (Lesotho) said because poverty reduction was a complex problem involving economic and social issues  international cooperation was required.  HIV/AIDS remained a challenge for Lesotho  he continued  asking that the post-2015 agenda place the unfinished Millennium Development Goals at the top of the new framework.  Turning to education  he said his country had one of the highest literacy rates in Southern Africa. CAROLINA PODOROGHIN (Republic of Moldova) said that Governments should pursue far more than economic growth to achieve social inclusion.  The international community needed to stay on track with the outstanding targets of the Millennium Goals.  During the last few of years  the social development paradigm of his country had been oriented towards empowering people and capitalizing on human potential.  Mainstreaming the internationally agreed development goals into national laws and strategic policies had facilitated the configuration of a comprehensive and forward-looking national agenda.  One example was the accession to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  with the Government pursuing not merely their social protection and health assistance but also the recognition of their human value  dignity and potential.  Further  in order to reduce youth unemployment  career guidance and recruitment assistance had been expanded to reach more young people. JOSEPH DELLATTE and LIEN WYCKMANS  youth delegates from Belgium  said that children and young people were not aware of their rights.  Full and equal access to information must be available to enable them to seek help when their rights were violated.  Turning to issues concerning young girls and lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender (LGBT) children and young people  Ms. WYCKMANS said they faced social limits  exclusion at schools and youth movements.  She called on Governments to both inform them of their rights and to protect them.  In conclusion  she applauded UN-Women’s HeForShe campaign for raising awareness of gender equality. ISELIN HEBBERT LARSEN (Norway) said international efforts for people with disabilities were focused on education  humanitarian assistance  health and women.  “Education is an important tool to ensure that children with disabilities can realize their human rights ” she added.  Strengthening education programmes for persons with disabilities needed mapping  data collection and planning for their inclusion in the public school system  she continued.  That  she concluded  required both financial resources and political will. ADRIAN LORENTSSON  of the Norwegian Association of Youth Mental Health  said that mental health problems among youth were an emerging global problem.  He urged Member States to involve service users as a guiding principle in the design  planning  delivery and organization of all health care services.  He said it was important to allow young people with disabilities to participate in decision-making processes on issues that concerned them.  BIANCA DRAGOMIR  a youth delegate of Romania  said the quality of education was a concern.  She noted that there were many outdated education system structures that existed  where an accumulation of information had replaced gaining knowledge.  “We too dream of an education that nurtures critical thinking and creativity ” she said.  Indeed  employers were interested in good communication and critical thinking  problem solving  responsibility and integrity  she concluded.  LUCA CIUBOTARU  a youth delegate of Romania  said that education prepared students for civic engagement  yet only 5 per cent of young people were involved with non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  In conclusion  he called for an increase in youth participation at the United Nations. YAO SHAOJUN (China) said that correct social policies could lead to inclusive and sustainable development.  The international community must attach great importance to reducing inequalities between countries  he said  recalling a Chinese proverb that recognized people as the foundation of the country.  Therefore  each Member State must ensure a decent standard of living for each member of its population.  In addition to social reforms that promoted employment and social security  public efforts must extend to protect vulnerable groups  such as people with disabilities and ageing populations.  China had achieved significant progress in improving its people’s well-being.  In 2013 alone  there was an increase of 13.1 million new jobs in China and per capita disposable income had increased by 7 per cent.  Urban and rural minimum subsistence allowances had been increased and the reform of the medical system had been deepened.  Further  China stood firmly with the Governments and peoples of Ebola-affected countries  he said  noting that in addition to shipments of medicines and medical equipment  his country had dispatched 200 medical workers to help. RITA DHITAL (Nepal) said that his country’s efforts were guided by the constitutional provision that prohibited discrimination “on grounds of religion  colour  caste  sex  tribe  origin  language or ideological conviction”.  Under its poverty reduction strategy  Nepal had initiated several programmes to generate employment opportunities and enhance productive capacity  with a particular focus on agriculture and infrastructure development in remote or rural areas.  Other efforts included positive discrimination in the form of quotas in education as well as targeted programmes in capacity-building initiatives and skill development training.  The Government was committed to ensuring that all children  particularly girls  children in difficult circumstances and those belonging to ethnic minorities  had access to free education.  Further  Nepal was a State party to 22 human rights instruments.  While not all Millennium Development Goals would be achieved by 2015  he said his country believed that the unfinished agenda must find a place in the post-2015 development agenda. JOSÉ ANTONIO DOS SANTOS (Paraguay) said that despite economic growth  it faced challenges to ensure that the growth was inclusive and to bridge the equality gap.  Poverty had been reduced to 23 per cent in 2013 from 35 per cent in 2009.  Specific programmes had been developed to benefit the families in rural and poor areas  he continued.  Providing an overview of efforts  he said action had been taken in various areas  including monetary allowances conditional to vaccinations and the education of children  pensions  housing  building family centres and distributing school kits and school lunches.  He then reiterated the importance of international cooperation as an important tool for the development of national programmes. NGUYEN TRAC BA (Viet Nam) said that the international community had made significant achievements in promoting social development  one of the three pillars of sustainable development.  Pointing out serious social challenges that remained  he called on the international community to redouble efforts to address the root causes of poverty  inequality and social exclusion  and to ensure social protection.  It was also crucial to support people with disabilities so they could exercise their political  economic  cultural and social rights  and participate equally in social activities.  In that regard  Viet Nam was preparing for the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities before the end of that year  he concluded. XAVIER LASSO MENDOZA (Ecuador) noted the need to overcome inequalities  which could be achievable if the post-2015 development agenda put human issues at the forefront.  In Ecuador  social issues were important  proven by the country’s investments in health care and education  ensuring access to justice  promoting economic and social rights and fostering artistic expression.  Turning to women’s empowerment  he said initiatives had been undertaken to promote and protect the rights of all women  including indigenous women.  Other areas addressed by the Government addressed issues concerning persons with disabilities  early childhood care and education and youth. ABULKALAM ABDUL MOMEN (Bangladesh) said that the adoption of the historic Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and Programme of Action in 1995 had put people at the centre of the development agenda  and identified poverty eradication  social inclusion  full employment and decent work for all as key elements for people’s empowerment.  Pointing out that 250 million primary school age children were not acquiring basic skills for reading  writing and mathematics  he pointed at a lack of access to quality education.  Further  mainstreaming youth in the overall development process  bringing the issue of disability to the forefront and enhancing international cooperation and collaboration for the empowerment of people were the prerequisites for sustaining the national efforts  he concluded. CHRISTOPHER GRIMA (Malta)  aligning his delegation with the European Union’s statement  recognized the need to strengthen the channels of communication between persons with disabilities  the State  service providers and NGOs.  The promotion and protection of rights of persons with disabilities had been put in place  he said  adding that partnerships with the private sector on development projects were also being sought to cater the everyday needs of persons with disabilities.  What was called for now  he said  was political decisiveness  harmonization and better coordination. KHALED MANZLAWIY (Saudi Arabia) said that efforts had been made towards social development  including targeting families  youth and persons with disabilities.  Training programmes for family dialogue were aimed at addressing issues facing society and strengthening their skills and communication.  On the elderly  he said that policies on putting them in better positions within the family had been developed.  Turning to persons with disabilities  he said their caregivers received support.  On youth he said that the national strategy focused on the needs of young people  including training  education and employment. CELINA GREPPLER  a youth delegate from Germany  said that there might be 20 million young people in Germany  yet there were 7 billion people worldwide  who did not want to be defined merely by their age.  People should contribute to creating and implementing policies and programmes at all levels against all forms of age-based discrimination against older but also against younger persons  she said.  OZAN SOLMUS  a youth delegate from Germany  said that age was just one feature of people.  People had multidimensional  dynamic personalities  which adapted according to their environment and experiences.  He underlined that identity meant many things  including being young and traditional  being old  being full of dreams for the future  or being European and Muslim at the same time. JESSICA ELIO (Bolivia) said her country’s major challenge was to build an equitable society.  The desired aim was to eradicate discrimination  overcome exclusion and reduce inequities and inequalities.  The 4.8 per cent national economic growth had contributed to a decrease of extreme poverty from 37 to 18 per cent.  School drop-out rates  especially for young girls  chronic malnutrition and illiteracy had also decreased  she said.  A national housing programme for indigenous families saw 47 000 houses built.  Turning to the issue of water  she said that 75 per cent of the population had access to drinking water. DANIEL ROSA  a youth delegate from Honduras  noted that his presence at the United Nations was the first time his country had sent a representative of young Hondurans.  The Government had created local laws and supported international resolutions  which had improved the inclusion of the youth in national dialogue and policymaking.  Despite limited resources  he said that Honduras had made considerable progress  and invited all Member States to support projects that would improve the inclusion of their youth in relevant activities. DESIRÉE DEL CARMEN CEDEÑO RENGIFO (Panama) said that eradicating poverty was the main challenge on the international development agenda.  Geography  vulnerability  age limitations and illnesses were the main factors affecting poverty around the world  she said.  Panama  in that regard  had been implementing several programmes aiming at reducing exclusion of vulnerable groups and inequality in society  including initiatives such as Guardian Angel  Universal Grant System  Safe Neighbourhood  and Network of Opportunities. SABRI BOUKADOUM (Algeria) said investments made in economic and human development had led to a reduction of the portion of the population that was living in poverty  from 15 per cent to 6 per cent.  On employment  he said that investments were made to create jobs in agriculture  industry  tourism and small- and medium-sized enterprises.  To support business creation  he added  administrative procedures had been simplified and shortened.  Turning to issues involving the elderly  he said that laws  regulations and policies to promote and protect their human rights had been adopted  alongside other social development initiatives. GLADWELL WAMBUI KAHARA  a youth delegate from Kenya  noted that the Ebola crisis had negatively impacted the course of social development.  Several regions of the world were experiencing situations that acted as obstacles to achieving economic and social growth  she continued  as resources had to be deployed to respond to humanitarian crises.  She also noted that the recent discussions of sustainable development goals provided an impetus for the post-2015 agenda framework.  Turning to another challenge  she said the influx of refugees had exerted a burden on the delivery of social services  particularly education  health and provision of security.  On unemployment  she said that the Government had instituted policy measures to set aside 30 per cent of all its tenders  including goods and services  to youth  women and persons with disabilities.  ERVIN NINA (Albania)  aligning his delegation with the statement delivered on behalf of the European Union  said unemployment was the major national challenge that needed urgent attention.  His country had recently introduced a new strategy to overcome unemployment and to promote social inclusion in order to ensured that no one was left behind.  In that regard  the Government was doing its best to protect and support people facing socioeconomic challenges and discrimination.  Underlining that providing opportunities to young people should be Albania’s priority  he noted that the Government was also concerned with the protection and promotion of human rights for people with disabilities. AMINA SMAILA (Nigeria) said efforts to confront poverty and unemployment had not yielded results  especially in least developed countries and sub-Saharan Africa.  For its part  Nigeria was focusing on strengthening its institutional capacities so that all social groups  including the vulnerable  could function effectively in society.  Further  her Government had formulated a youth development policy as well as a draft policy on ageing.  Nigeria was also addressing the issue of accessibility of persons with disabilities in all public buildings and facilities through sustained advocacy campaigns. DER KOGDA (Burkina Faso)  aligning his delegation with the statement made on behalf of the “Group of 77”  said progress had been made in social development  including in youth employment and in the promotion and protection of the rights of persons with disabilities and the elderly.  Financial resources had been set aside to benefit persons with disabilities  especially children  he added.  Also  a general census had been conducted to gather data and information in order to better tailor interventions targeting children with disabilities.  Additional initiatives had been set up to benefit the youth and the family  he concluded. MPHO MICHELLE MOGOBE (Botswana)  aligning his delegation with the statement delivered on behalf of the “Group of 77”  said that her country was prioritizing the eradication of poverty  creation of employment opportunities and promotion of social integration.  Many citizens in Botswana still had limited access to potable water  sanitation  food and shelter  or access to quality education and health care.  Therefore  the Government had introduced several initiatives to solve these problems.  Programmes were also in place to enable vulnerable population groups to participate actively in the economic  social and cultural spheres of the country.  However  national capacities were inadequate to effectively respond to those challenges and Botswana had joined the Secretary-General in calling for the establishment of a coordinating mechanism within the United Nations to address those and other gaps. YAROSLAV GOLITSYN (Ukraine) said that the progress of reform within the Millennium Development Framework had been fundamentally disrupted by the conflict in his country’s two eastern regions and the illegal annexation of the Crimea.  Ensuring the protection of 5.1 million citizens living in conflict-affected areas was a priority for his Government.  Calling on the international community to support the launch of the preliminary response plan  he said that providing technical support to the Government in the field of preparedness and humanitarian response would enable thousands of Ukrainians to start rebuilding their lives. HAHN CHOONGHEE (Republic of Korea) said that a highly empowered population can change the future of a nation  as shown by the example of his country.  Basic social protection schemes  such as income support for vulnerable people and universal health care services  had proven to be effective in helping members of society stay resilient in times of economic crisis  he added.  Several policies had already been put in place to address the needs of the youth  the elderly  persons with disabilities and the family. YEJI PARK  a youth delegate of the Republic of Korea  said when considering the post-2015 development agenda  economic development and environmental protection could not bring the “future we want” if social development was underestimated.  She also said her country’s full utilization of ICT had been a driver for economic development and social inclusion. CRISTIÁN BARROS MELET (Chile) said that the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day was reduced by 50 per cent since the day Chile committed itself to the Millennium Development Goals.  His country had made progress in reducing extreme poverty  providing basic services  improving quality of life and overcoming inequality.  In addition  he said that the empowerment of people was key to working towards eradicating poverty.  In that regard  his Government had focused on a number of areas  including educational reform  gender equality  economic growth and decent work for all.  Despite some progress  gender inequality remained a challenge.  Next year would mark the twentieth anniversary of the World Summit for Social Development  and as one of its first organizers  Chile had urged the Member States and United Nations funds and programmes to renew their commitment to ensuring social inclusion  creating decent work for all and eradicating extreme poverty. LASHA SHAKULASHVILI  a youth delegate from Georgia  said that young people perceived themselves as both the generation of tomorrow and also a generation that could make change today.  Speaking about the importance of participation in the decision-making process  she confirmed that young Georgians were ready to contribute and build a desired future together with older generations.  Further  increased participation of youth in international affairs was critical for achieving sustainable development in the post-2015 development era.  Noting that there were 73 million unemployed young people worldwide  she concluded that youth could act as the main watchdogs for observing the process and make a positive impact on issues that concerned youth  both locally and globally. SHIRUZIMATH SAMEER (Maldives) said that despite impressive progress made on economic development and poverty eradication  income distribution remained a major challenge.  She recognized that building equitable societies required social integration through full employment and decent work for all.  The provision of small- and medium-sized enterprise loans  diversification of the economy  increasing vocational training and skills development and expanding employment opportunities could address those issues  she said.  In advancing social development  it was important to remember that climate challenges could not be ignored  as they undermined sustainable development. AMANUEL GIORGIO (Eritrea) said that youth remained Africa’s greatest asset  although the rate of unemployment and underemployment among young Africans was a concern.  At the national level  programmes related to food security  building and delivering basic services and restoring the environment were being implemented.  However  despite efforts to improve education and health care service delivery  Eritrea had faced additional obstacles  particularly sanctions and the occupation of its territory. ELLEN AZARIA MADUHU (United Republic of Tanzania) said that access to universal quality education could serve as a pathway for vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals to move out of poverty.  Her country had achieved great success in providing universal primary education and had embarked on the expansion of tertiary education  but still faced challenges of the quality of education  the literacy ratio between men and women and a lack of skilled teachers.  While her Government would continue to do its part  she asked that development partners assist developing countries in building the financial and human resource capacity needed to respond to needs  particularly education  health and employment of people with disabilities. MOHAMED IBRAHIM MOHAMED ELBAHI (Sudan) said the global financial crisis and related challenges had “cast a shadow” on achieving social development.  International efforts were needed to foster development goals in a more cohesive way and international partnerships should incorporate social development in the post-2015 development agenda.  At the national level  a comprehensive initiative involving all sectors of society was in place to discuss issues affecting them.  Turning to persons with disabilities  he said that social care homes had been established.  The remaining challenges required strengthening coordination  deepening cooperation through partnership-building  disbursement of development assistance and debt forgiveness  he concluded. RUBÉN IGNACIO ZAMORA RIVAS (El Salvador) said that Governments played a significant role in enabling people to escape from poverty  find productive employment and decent work and to achieve social integration.  To reach long-term development goals  his Government had reiterated its commitment to combat poverty and inequality by seeking active participation of its citizens.  Governments should pay attention to the problems and needs of young people who were the agents of change.  Giving them the opportunity to express their views about the future of the development agenda in both regional and international forums would have a significant impact for the development. BANDAR AL-ERYANI (Yemen) said his country was the poorest nation in the Middle East  with over 45 per cent of the population living under the poverty level.  Since the food  fuel and financial crisis of 2009  the country had been dealing with food insecurity  chronic malnutrition and a lack of access to water  education and health.  Providing services was also challenging as many citizens lived in remote areas.  To address those and related issues  he called for an improvement in humanitarian assistance  an increase in cooperation and coordination to find development solutions. MADINA KARABAEVA (Kyrgyzstan) said that debt burden  geographic isolation and its status as a landlocked developing country posed difficulties in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  She asked that greater attention be paid to that special category of countries in international forums.  At the national level  the vision was for a stable Government to guarantee human rights  observing the rule of law and pursuing sustainable economic growth.  Recognizing the increase in migrant workers and the importance of remittances for food  health and housing  she called for the post-2015 development agenda to pay attention to the nexus between migrants and development.  MARÍA LUZ MELÓN (Argentina) said that strengthening social development must be based on human rights  including civil  economic  social and cultural.  Recognizing the key role of Governments  she said her country had developed people-centric strategies.  She then underlined the importance of ensuring human rights for all  particularly older adults  adolescents  persons with disabilities and indigenous people  without prejudices.  Eradicating extreme poverty must be the main aim of the international community  she said  noting that Argentina had succeeded in its efforts to combat poverty despite its economic and financial crisis in 2008.  Seeing the Millennium Development Goals as catalysts for shaping public policy  her country expected all Member States to engage in dialogue to make progress. KEVIN CASSIDY  International Labour Organization (ILO)  agreed that empowerment was needed for the effective participation of all members of society in decision-making processes.  Pointing to the Secretary-General’s report  which stated that “empowerment is a long-term process towards the effective participation of all members of society in decision-making processes that affect their lives”  he recognized decent work as empowering in itself in its ability to effect positive change in people’s lives at the national and local levels.  Efforts to increase trade and promote investment liberalization and infrastructure spending  he continued  were not sufficient to improve economic and social development unless accompanied by dedicated efforts to boost employment and decent work opportunities.  Despite the challenges faced  he welcomed the recognition of decent work as an important goal that is relevant to all countries regardless of their stage of development. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-08,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaef3396.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. As the Second Committee (Economic and Financial) continued its general debate today  delegates discussed a number of development issues  including the need to tackle external debt. “Unscrupulous speculation” by vulture funds had to be curbed  according to Argentina’s representative  because it “conspired against equitable growth and sustainable development”.  Adoption of General Assembly resolution 68/304 on a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring sought to tackle the issue and gear the financial system and its institutions towards helping countries emerge from crises. The representative of Venezuela also supported that resolution  adding that vulture funds posed a threat to the restructuring efforts of countries.  The distortions such practices caused were a function of an economic model that promoted “accumulation of wealth” by the minority at the expense of the whole  and which caused desertification  biodiversity loss and climate change. While echoing calls for action on sovereign debt distress  the representative of the United States stressed the need to do so without creating market uncertainties.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Capital Markets Association were the institutions best equipped to handle such debt issues. Among several delegates noting the significance of the Committee’s session  the representative of Pakistan looked forward to its “most momentous” for many years  as negotiations continued on a post-2015 development agenda and sustainable development goals.  The agenda should be transformative  but States did not need to “reinvent the wheel”  and the new agenda should build on past successes and lessons learned.  Resources had to be commensurate with the mandates given. A number of delegates repeated the call for adequate resources to tackle poverty  with Nigeria’s representative calling for a doubling of official development assistance (ODA)  and the representative of Ethiopia noting that ODA to Africa had declined.  He called for action to reverse that trend and hoped that the upcoming conference on financing for development  which his country would host  would achieve a robust and sustainable agreement. The representative of Spain echoed the view that financing was a major challenge  but pointed out that his country was meeting its commitments to global development  and he urged other States to follow that example.  His country had established the first fund devoted to the sustainable development goals  and it had been the first to contribute to the adaptation fund to tackle the effects of climate change. The threat posed by climate change was clearly articulated  with the delegate of Maldives underlining the particular vulnerabilities his country faced  and Burkina Faso’s representative noting the threat posed to humanity at large.  Resilience capacities needed to be built  meaning technology transfer would be important.  The Paris conference needed to end with an agreement to achieve both “the future we want” and to ensure humanity’s continued survival and development. The representative of United Republic of Tanzania also underscored the need for an agreement on climate change  continuing to outline his country’s commitment to sustainable  inclusive agriculture policies under the terms of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development’s (NEPAD) Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme.  He described several national initiatives  including a food security investment plan. The representative of Azerbaijan also described national level policies  notably the progress made towards achieving the aim of ensuring that 9.7 per cent of Azerbaijan’s total energy consumption came from wind and solar power by 2020.  She also discussed regional cooperation on the $15 billion Southern Gas Corridor and the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway line. Such cooperation and partnership was vital  with several delegations taking up the issue.  The representative of Qatar hoped to be able to strengthen her country’s involvement in South-South cooperation  while she was also one of a number of delegates to highlight the importance of an open  non-discriminatory and multilateral trade system. Also speaking today were representatives of Nepal  China  Chile  San Marino  Thailand  Mongolia  Sri Lanka  Yemen  El Salvador  India  Bangladesh  Dominican Republic  Uganda  Myanmar  Australia  Republic of Korea  Guyana  Cameroon  Botswana  Singapore  Zimbabwe  Rwanda  Guatemala  Peru  Kyrgyzstan  Viet Nam  Zambia  Guinea  Afghanistan  Jamaica  Ecuador  Kuwait  Samoa  Papua New Guinea  Solomon Islands  and Lebanon. An observer for the Holy See also spoke. The Second Committee will reconvene on Thursday  9 October  to continue its debate. HENRY SUÁREZ (Venezuela)  associating himself with the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  described the negative impacts of an economic model that promoted “accumulation of wealth” and caused inequality and destruction of resources.  The world was weakened by war and financial crisis  and the only place enjoying prosperity was the financial system.  Resources were in the hands of a few instead of being used to benefit the whole  and the economic system catalysed desertification  biodiversity loss and climate change.  A “Pre-COP” meeting in Caracas ahead of the Lima Climate Conference would offer space for dialogue between Governments and social organizations.  New proposals for sustainable development had to minimize the risks of crises like the ones the world had recently faced  while solutions were needed for systemic economic distortions like sovereign debt crises and corrupt practices.  Vulture funds threatened countries’ restructuring efforts  and he supported multilateral regulatory legal framework for debt resolution and reform of the international financial architecture  to ensure democratization and participation of developing countries. MATEO ESTREME (Argentina)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  stressed the importance of tackling external debt.  It was time to end the “unscrupulous speculation” by vulture funds that “conspired against equitable growth and sustainable development”.  Resolution 68/304 on the multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring sought to do that  gearing the financial system and its institutions towards helping countries emerge from crises.  If negotiations in the session proceeded smoothly  States could arrange substantive issues in 2015.  Argentina’s development efforts focused on improving people’s quality of life  and no single development model was the prescription for success.  That had to be a central tenet of the post-2015 development agenda.  He underlined the right to migration and his hopes for an international convention  and noted that the effects of climate change affected developing countries most  despite their small contribution to the problem.  A draft of the elements of a new global agreement should emerge from the Lima Conference.  The international trading system needed reform  and he promoted all varieties of alternative international cooperation. DURGA PRASAD BHATTARAI (Nepal)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Group of Least Developed Countries  said the latter were most off-track in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  The post-2015 development agenda should incorporate the unfinished business of those Goals  with an overarching aim of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.  Nepal had set the goal to graduate from the least developed country status by 2022  but also being a land-locked economy  it faced many structural barriers in its development efforts.  Due to its remoteness from the market  marginalization and lack of integration into the regional and global value chains  its competitive strengths had been limited.  He also said that saving mountain ecosystems through appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures was critical in addressing the adverse effects of climate change and the associated disasters. WANG MIN (China)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said the international community should plan carefully for the future of cooperation for development.  The session should focus on mobilizing the international will to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  for which it was necessary to guarantee development resources.  The new agenda should have those Goals as its basis  and make poverty eradication a priority.  He called for improved global economic governance  an increased voice for the emerging markets in developing countries  and the reduction of their debt burden.  His country’s gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 7.7 per cent in 2013 and by 7.6 per cent in the first half of 2014  and it intended to deepen reforms and further open up their economy. CARLOS OLGUÍN CIGARROA (Chile)  associating himself with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  and the Group of 77 and China  highlighted the central role of international multilateralism in tackling global problems.  His country would maintain the same level of commitment to build a single post-2015 agenda  and would focus on a consensus to guarantee sustainable development and the eradication of poverty.  He outlined the following goals as particularly important for his country: combatting poverty; empowerment of women and girls; inclusive economic growth and job creation; environment and climate change; and a peaceful society  citizen security  access to justice and strengthening the rule of law.  On the post-2015 development agenda  it should be flexible and adaptable to challenges that might arise in the future. DANIELE D. BODINI (San Marino) said no single country or institution could find a lasting solution to economic challenges alone.  Recent crises had caused uncertainty among people and leaders.  The historic economic model had been proven wrong  while new models were not in place.  The United Nations was the best place for making long-term plans to tackle long-term crises  and it had to remain at the centre of dialogue on the world’s future.  Many ideas were being considered  and the task now was prioritizing and ensuring that goals would be implemented.  Whatever goals were agreed  it was vital to meet them because there was nothing worse than making promises and failing to deliver.  When things went wrong with no solutions offered  populations turned to “unpredictable  uncontrollable and violent behaviour”.  Member States had to work together to agree on plans for the future of youth  women and elders. MASOOD KHAN (Pakistan)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said the current session was “the most momentous” for many years  because the Committee was charged with crafting the post-2015 development agenda and fulfilling the processes initiated at the Rio+20 Conference.  While aiming to set a transformative agenda  States did not need to “reinvent the wheel”.  Rather  cumulative experiences and collective wisdom needed bringing to bear  and the new agenda should build on past successes and lessons learned.  The Millennium Development Goals had changed global discourse  but their work was far from done.  Where they had fallen short  they did so because of a lack of resources.  This time  resources had to be commensurate with the mandates given.  The Monterrey Consensus had outlined policy actions needed to achieve the Goals  and it was important to assess shortfalls fairly and agree on actions needed to implement the sustainable development goals if the Third Conference on Financing for Development was to be successful. NORACHIT SINHASENI (Thailand) said that once the Millennium Development Goals had reached their end-point  the international community would have to arrive at a post-2015 development agenda.  His country firmly believed that the sustainable development goals proposed by the Open Working Group should be the main basis of negotiations on that.  People had to remain central to the agenda  a strong means of implementation was key  and all avenues of partnership had to be explored.  He touched on issues involving climate change  disaster risk reduction  trade  financing for development  and agricultural development as well as food security  and noted that 2015 would be the International Year of Soils. GANBOLD GONCHIG (Mongolia)  associating himself with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China  said that the report of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals should not be renegotiated  and should be the basis for integrating those goals in the post-2015 development agenda.  Mongolia was affected by climate change  which was no challenge for the future  but a reality of today.  Touching on issues of trade  he noted how recent high-level visits from China and Russia had helped resolve a number of issues in transport and logistics.  Finally  as the Second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries would be held in Vienna in November  he expressed hope that the Conference would assist in tackling the specific structural challenges of the coming decade. PALITHA T. B. KOHONA (Sri Lanka)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that balancing economic growth and simultaneously protecting the environment would remain a preeminent challenge  and called on developed countries to honour their commitments and balance the damage they had done to the environment.  The post-2015 agenda must focus on implementation  develop a real global partnership for development and allow States to set their own domestic priorities.  Despite being challenged by a “ruthless” terrorist group and the devastating 2004 tsunami  Sri Lanka had achieved most of the Millennium Development Goals  and ranked ahead of all South Asian countries in the 2013 Human Development Index.  One of the examples of his country’s progress was the decline in absolute poverty to 6.7 per cent in 2013 from 15.2 per cent in 2007. ALYA AHMED SAIF AL-THANI (Qatar)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  said that developing countries were responsible for organizing their resources and for their development.  However  donor countries must help them by relieving their debt burden and by encouraging trade.  In that context  she highlighted the importance of an open  non-discriminatory and multilateral trade system.  Her country intended to advance by 2030  to strengthen its institutions and civil society.  They hoped to be among the first States seeking to strengthen South-South cooperation  which had the potential to benefit all countries.  Concerning the Palestinian issue  she said that Israel’s continued occupation was “illegal and inhumane”  and called on it to honour its international obligations  and cease those practices immediately.  Peace  stability and sustainable development were closely interlinked  and together could contribute to development and prosperity. Mr. ABDY (Yemen)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Group of Least Developed Countries  said poverty eradication should be among the highest priorities.  The lack of security and political stability had negatively affected his country’s progress in achieving development goals.  Drawing from that experience  he underscored that the goals could only be achieved with good governance and security.  He also highlighted the importance of providing assistance to the least developed countries to develop their productive capacities  and called for the revitalisation of the Istanbul Programme of Action.  On climate change  he said it represented a threat to many countries’ survival  and had become one of the factors for conflict  violence and the lack of security. EMMANUEL OLUWADARE OGUNTUYI (Nigeria)  associating himself with the African Group and the Group of 77 and China  said that access to decent housing  health care  education  clean water and food should be rights.  Acknowledging the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals  it was necessary to relentlessly pursue the “unfinished business”.  Eradicating poverty remained the most significant challenge for developing countries  especially in Africa  with sound  practical and achievable poverty reduction strategies needed.  Official development assistance (ODA) was vital to development  especially for countries in special situations  and States should double contributions.  Political will and adequate resources were essential to fulfilling the global development agenda.  The international community needed to find innovative financing measures.  Nigeria’s national transformation agenda focused on capacity expansion to enable marketing of products abroad and to attract foreign direct investment  and also noted the challenge desertification posed to achieving sustainable development. ELIZABETH COUSENS (United States) said it was an “electrifying time” to work on development issues.  Diligence would be required in the coming weeks to ensure the Committee avoided duplicating efforts  with several other processes ongoing.  Reaffirming the development priorities of the United States  she called for accelerated efforts to complete the Millennium Development Goals  and prioritization of issues like poverty and access to water and sanitation in the post-2015 agenda.  In the agenda  more focus should also fall on gender equality  inclusive growth  peace  institution building and sustainability of seas and oceans.  Climate change threatened the world’s shared vision of inclusive development.  The upcoming conference on financing for development could be a powerful platform for agreeing on a modernized approach by mobilizing new and larger sources of financing  including remittances  domestic resources and South-South cooperation.  She supported the provision of credit to pursue development  stressing that sovereign debt distress should be resolved without creating market uncertainties.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Capital Markets Association were the best places to resolve such debt issues.  She underlined her Government’s commitment to countries in special situations  especially those in Africa  landlocked developing countries and small island developing States. HASSAN HUSSAIN SHIHAB (Maldives)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Alliance of Small Island States  urged the Committee to come up with an action plan for the full implementation of the Samoa Pathway outcome document.  As a small island developing State facing unique vulnerabilities in its sustainable development  Maldives had graduated from the least developed countries status in 2011  but the inherent structural challenges of being an archipelago of small  low-lying and remote islands remained.  As for his country  sustainable development was inherently about oceans  providing livelihood to its people.  As such  he was delighted to see their conservation as a stand-alone goal in the new agenda.  On climate change  global action was a prerequisite for sustainable development  he stressed  referring to estimates predicting that  in the relatively short span of 10 years  his country would need to invest $1.5 billion in climate change adaptation and mitigation measures. KHANIM IBRAHIMOVA (Azerbaijan) underlined the need for alternative forms of cooperation in boosting development.  The proposed sustainable development goals would provide steady ground on which countries could build their development strategies.  She reaffirmed her commitment to the outcomes of conferences in the social  economic and environmental fields.  The proper means of implementation were essential to translating sustainable development commitments into tangible outcomes.  Countries in special situations faced particular challenges.  Her own country had made remarkable progress on renewable energy  and aimed to ensure that 9.7 per cent of its total energy consumption came from wind and solar power by 2020.  Such a policy was rare for an oil and gas rich country.  Regional cooperation had proceeded on the Southern Gas Corridor  a $15 billion pipeline that allowed gas to flow to Europe  and on the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway line linking Azerbaijan  Georgia and Turkey. DER KOGDA (Burkina Faso)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  called on the international community and the United Nations to respond to the aspirations of the many people worldwide living in destitution.  Efforts to eliminate poverty and other scourges that assailed billions had to be redoubled.  Firm commitments were needed  as were reforms of the international trade and economic systems  with priority going to the weakest and those in special situations.  For capacity building in developing countries  more effort needed to be expended on alternative forms of assistance  such as South-South and triangular cooperation.  Climate change posed a major threat to the future of humanity  and resilience capacities needed to be built  and technology transfer was important to that.  Commitment was needed  including an agreement in Paris in 2015 in order to achieve “the future we want” and to ensure the development and survival of humanity.  Commitment was needed to cooperate  and the United Nations needed to play its role in creating a world that was more “fair  prosperous and stable”. RUBÉN IGNACIO ZAMORA RIVAS (El Salvador)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  said the international community must build a common framework for trade and transfer of technology  tackle the economic crisis  speed up recovery  and build a more inclusive society.  On implementing the post-2015 development agenda  he underscored the importance of financing for development  with ODA playing a central role.  He suggested the concept of middle-income countries be redefined  taking into account factors such as inequality  poverty  investment  gender issues  education and environment.  Although his country was not responsible for climate change  it was the first to suffer.  El Salvador was focusing its efforts on adaptation measures to those changes  which would reduce the loss of human life and financial losses due to natural disasters.  In that context  he called on the international community to address the questions of vulnerability and adaptation to climate change. BHAGWANT SINGH BISHNOI (India)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that inequality had to be addressed by promoting robust and sustained inclusive growth  expanding investments in social infrastructure  ending the rampant energy poverty in developing countries  and correcting the inequities and imbalances in the global governance system.  While his country did not necessarily agree with each and every element of the final package  the proposal of the Open Working Group provided a sound basis for integrating sustainable development goals into the post-2015 development agenda.  The ambition of the agenda must be matched by the ambition of the means of implementation for developing countries.  There must be a holistic approach to finance to address issues such as falling ODA  volatile capital flows  continued debt problems  trade-distorting agricultural subsidies by developed countries and non-tariff barriers. JUAN MANUEL GONZÁLEZ DE LINARES PALOU (Spain) urged States to follow his country’s example by complying with their commitments to the global development agenda  ensuring the most vulnerable and neediest outside their own borders were not left behind.  Financing was one of the main challenges to be negotiated in developing the post-2015 agenda.  In that context  his country had established the first fund devoted to sustainable development goals.  Spain also had been the first to contribute to the adaptation fund  and the first country in the world where wind energy had been the primary source of electricity for an entire year.  Reflecting upon the thousands of people suffering from Ebola and hundreds of children not being able to go to school  he recalled that behind every goal they negotiated  they must aspire to a dignified life for every human being. ABDUL MOMEN (Bangladesh) aligned himself with the statements made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China  and with that made by Benin on behalf of the Group of Least-Developed Countries.  He questioned whether the base of the Millennium Development Goals was strong enough on which to build the post-2015 development agenda  and urged all States to address that task by focusing on the eradication of poverty.  Looking forward to next year’s conference on financing for development in Addis Ababa  he noted his Government’s willingness to contribute to discussions regarding migration.  On poverty  he said nearly three-fourths of the population in least-developed countries lived below the poverty level  and those countries’ share in global trade had not changed in the last four decades.  As long as least-developed countries existed  the international community had to work even harder to ensure that no one was left behind. MARCOS MONTILLA (Dominican Republic)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  and the Alliance of Small Island States  emphasized international efforts towards fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals  particularly in relation to drafting the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda.  The eradication of poverty and hunger needed special attention  and the revitalization of agriculture would be essential if hunger were to be halved by 2015.  Most municipalities in the Dominican Republic depended on agriculture  and the Government worked to boost rural employment  ensure access to credit and address issues including reforestation and improving living conditions.  The poverty index had been reduced by 6 per cent  lifting millions from that scourge.  Access to technology was important if results were to be achieved  as was development financing.  A global consensus was needed  and he reiterated his Government’s political will in pursuit of sustainable development. AMAN HASSEN BAME (Ethiopia)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  the Group of Least Developed Countries and the African Group  welcomed the fact that the conclusions of the Open Working Group would form the basis for integrating the sustainable development goals into the post-2015 development agenda.  The goals should be universal  but account for national policies and priorities.  Climate change remained a major threat to humanity  especially to Africa  a continent that contributed “almost nothing” but suffered its effects most.  The Paris conference should bring a major breakthrough in reaching a legally binding climate agreement  with resources vital.  Without them  developing countries could not adapt.  ODA to Africa had declined  and action was needed to reverse that.  Ethiopia would host the third conference on Financing for Development and he hoped a robust  sustainable agreement would emerge from it.  He made note of his country’s climate resilient green growth strategy and efforts to build infrastructure and improve the business environment. RICHARD NDUHUURA (Uganda) associated himself with the Group of 77 and China  the Group of Least Developed Countries  the African Group  and the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries.  The session took place as several processes came to an end and it was necessary to embark on negotiations for a transformative post-2015 agenda.  The Millennium Development Goals had galvanized action to build an inclusive agenda  and significant progress had been made.  Uganda had reached the international poverty target  together with several other targets.  Many other developing countries were unlikely to meet the Goals  however  despite their best efforts  and that was due mainly to the failure to fulfil Goal 8.  Going forward  harnessing partnerships would be critical  and it was the responsibility of Governments to lead the charge against poverty.  For the least developed countries  sustainable development required technology  peace and security  unrestricted access to markets  infrastructure  partnerships  financing and measures to combat climate change. RAMADHAN M. MWINYI (United Republic of Tanzania)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  said climate change was “unmistakably one of the greatest challenges of our time”.  Following the recent Climate Summit  momentum had to be sustained.  The aim after the Lima and Paris conferences was a legally binding agreement under the provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  Sustainable  inclusive agriculture was also crucial  as it provided food and livelihood to Tanzanians  and he welcomed the Open Working Group’s proposal to include a goal on ending hunger and ensuring nutrition.  Work under the framework of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development’s (NEPAD) Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme was proceeding  with the Programme reinvigorated through the Malabo Declaration.  His country had launched several initiatives to transform its agriculture sector  including a food security investment plan.  Welcoming the outcome of the conference on small island developing States and looking forward to the conference on landlocked developing countries  he noted the importance of partnerships to realizing development aspirations. HAU DO SUAN (Myanmar)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  and the Group of Least Developed Countries  said that his country was putting poverty alleviation at the centre of its development policy  with special emphasis on income generation and employment.  For the first time in 30 years  it had successfully conducted a nationwide population and housing census  the results of which would enable better planning  development  and improvement of the Myanmar people’s quality of life.  With the Government’s reforms and gradual lifting of economic sanctions from the West  ODA flows to the country had started to increase.  Moreover  market access had been improving with rising exports and growing foreign direct investments  and debt sustainability had improved with largest creditor countries’ cancellation of nearly half of its total debt.  As a result of its economic reforms  Myanmar had achieved GDP growth rates of 5.6  7.3 and 8.7 per cent in the past three consecutive years  and had  as a result  decided to take the necessary steps to graduate from the least developed countries status. SHARMAN STONE (Australia) said that sustainable development relied on investing in the development of people and societies  adding that as innovative solutions were looked for  new partnerships with the private sector should be sought.  Gender equality was critical to development  which also must reach people with disabilities.  Located in a region with many small island developing States  her country understood that healthy oceans underpinned efforts to eradicate poverty.  Economic growth was “essential” to sustainable development  global trade should be boosted  and as Chair of the G20 in 2014  her country was committed to raising collective economic growth  improving tax cooperation  facilitating investment in infrastructure and mobilizing financial resources. OH JOON (Republic of Korea) said that the post-2015 development agenda should be built on the Millennium Development Goals.  Welcoming the adoption of the report of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  he suggested that the 17 goals therein should be the international community’s basic guidelines for sustainable development.  A more holistic and integrated approach was needed  however  and the 2014 agenda should be built on more “concrete” and “action-oriented” partnerships.  Only efficient monitoring  however  would guarantee the realization of new goals  and his delegation hoped that the Busan Global Partnership  which had already been joined by 46 countries  might serve as a useful tool in that regard. GEORGE TALBOT (Guyana)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  and the Alliance of Small Island States  said that a satisfactory post-2015 agenda must be premised on sustainable development that was bold and ambitious  as well as universally relevant and inclusive.  Moreover  the requisite means for its implementation and an enabling environment for its realization must be ensured.  The agenda must also be flexible enough to address the peculiar needs of countries in different circumstances  such as small island developing States  whose progress could far too often be speedily reversed due to the impacts of climate change  natural disasters and external economic shocks.  He welcomed the highly indebted small island developing States’ initiative  which would bring relief to small island developing States  whose average public debt had been pegged at more than 80 per cent of GDP this year  to help them build their resilience in dealing with climate change and natural disaster impacts. MICHEL TOMMO MONTHE (Cameroon)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the African Group  emphasized that the Open Working Group was the sole forum mandated to define the sustainable development goals.  Its intergovernmental nature and openness to civil society gave it “unquestioned legitimacy”  and its report on the goals should not be reopened or renegotiated.  Another important report was that of the Panel of Experts on Financing for Development  while negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda had to include a plan for technology transfer  and the agenda’s overall aim had to be the elimination of poverty through economic transformation of countries of the South.  African countries needed special assistance  particularly in improving productive capacities and gaining better access to markets.  Cameroon sought to become an “emerging economy” by 2035  and was making progress.  Growth was increasing yearly  and public investment accounted for 30.2 per cent of the State budget.  A major challenge was employment  which remained a decisive factor in eliminating poverty and providing stability. C. T. NTWAAGAE (Botswana)  aligning himself with the statements delivered by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China  as well the statement delivered by Malawi on behalf of the Africa Group  welcomed the outcome of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals.  Addressing the concerns of landlocked developing countries would be “pivotal” during the session  as many of those countries’ economies were not well diversified.  Their agricultural sectors were also threatened by land degradation  desertification and climate change.  His country looked forward to the upcoming Second United Nations Conference of the Landlocked Developing Countries to be held in Vienna.  Other upcoming conferences  those to be held in Lima and in Paris  respectively  on the topic of climate change  would also add impetus to the ongoing negotiations under the UNFCCC process. EUGENE NG (Singapore)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  ASEAN  and the Alliance of Small Island States  said that the Open Working Group report should be the main basis for integrating the sustainable development goals into the post-2015 development agenda.  He hoped for a pragmatic  outcome-based and quantifiable approach to targets to be adopted for the agenda.  His country would focus on urbanization  water  and sanitation  he said  stressing the means of implementation  in particular partnerships  as another area which must be given more attention.  For the partnerships to work  the United Nations must play an enhanced role in coordinating them  as well as in ensuring the implementation of their commitments. FREDERICK MUSIIWA MAKAMURE SHAVA (Zimbabwe)  aligning his statement with that made by Bolivia and by Malawi on behalf of the Group of 77 and China  said that rising income and wealth disparities would have a negative impact on the world economy if concerted mitigating measures were not taken now.  Poverty eradication and sustainable development should remain the central goal of the post-2015 development agenda.  It was imperative to put into place a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring that would regulate the international regime for such debt.  He touched upon issues such as technology transfer  international trade  and climate change  concluding that his country believed a world without poverty was possible. JEANNE D’ARC BYAJE (Rwanda)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  Group of Least Developed Countries  and the African Group  said that her country was committed to expediting the remaining work on the Millennium Development Goals to meet its targets.  Furthermore  priorities were being set to address the gaps and challenges towards achieving global sustained economic growth and financial stability for the post-2015 development agenda.  In a global quest for poverty eradication  every nation must invest in its people by providing a good social protection system  geared at improving their well-being.  Moreover  sustainable development could not be achieved without peace and security  without adequate means of implementation  or without enhanced international cooperation based on a renewed global partnership. LEIVA ROESCH (Guatemala)  associating herself with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  and the Group of 77 and China  was pleased that the final report gave priority to eradicating poverty and hunger  and included goals on climate change and peaceful society.  She called for strengthening of the means of implementation  and for deepening of financial mechanisms crucial for achieving the goals.  Her country supported the establishment of a facilitation mechanism  which could be the key platform to ensure the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda.  Moreover  her Government believed that the agenda should reflect the human rights of the most vulnerable populations  particularly migrant women and children. AUGUSTO THORNBERRY (Peru)  associating himself with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  and the Group of 77 and China  said they aimed to free mankind of hunger and fear by prioritizing social inclusion.  The post-2015 development agenda should facilitate the transfer and access to technology.  Belonging to the most unequal region in the world  Peru had  in only one generation  managed to decrease the proportion of those living in poverty from over a half to less than a fifth of its population.  It also had achieved the Millennium Development Goals earlier than planned.  A priority must be given to the legitimacy and effectiveness of the United Nations system and international financial institutions  he said  which must provide for the participation of all stakeholders — public and private  national and international — in a new global partnership for development. TALAIBEK KYDYROV (Kyrgyzstan)  stressing the importance of reaching “harmony between the environment and human activities”  described his country’s National Strategy for 2013-2017  which integrated principles of sustainable development in the Government’s national policies.  One of the main reasons for extreme poverty was geographical disadvantage  and Kyrgyzstan was characterized by remoteness  isolation  inaccessibility and high living costs.  Mountain ecosystems were sensitive to global warming  so a high priority was attached to climate change adaptation and mitigation.  Ice cover in Kyrgyzstan was expected to decrease 40 per cent by 2025  resulting in a one-third reduction in regional availability of water.  Hydropower development would help provide affordable energy and solve a number of problems related to seasonal flooding  balanced water use and downstream irrigation.  He stressed the importance of intensified international activity on restoring and securing uranium tailings in Kyrgyzstan  noting that many were in densely populated areas and exposed to the threat of landslides and floods. NGUYEN TRAC BA (Viet Nam)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and ASEAN  noted major increases in international trade between 2013 and 2014  although pre-crisis rates had not yet been reached.  The Bali Package represented moderate progress on international trade; nonetheless  implementation remained a concern  particularly for developing countries.  Development gains were consistently under threat from climate change  epidemics like Ebola  and instability and conflict.  He stressed the importance of peace and security to creating an enabling environment for development  underscoring that the United Nations was vital to norm-setting and coordination of common efforts to tackle global challenges.  He welcomed results of the Climate Summit and Conference on small island developing States  and looked forward for a meaningful agreement on climate change in 2015.  With his country on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  he welcomed the outcome of the Open Working Group on sustainable development goals  particularly its stronger focus on economic development and more robust goals. MWABA PATRICIA KASESE-BOTA (Zambia) spoke on behalf of the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries  describing the comparative disadvantages they faced on issues such as trade.  Their geographical situations hampered progress  with no access to the sea  and the need to pay multiple customs duties when crossing borders.  That made exports uncompetitive and made imports too expensive for locals.  The Almaty Programme of Action sought to address the issues those countries faced.  She pointed to gains made by landlocked developing countries in transport and trade infrastructure  and to improvements in their share of trade over the previous decade  despite the disadvantages. Work to implement the Millennium Development Goals was uneven  slow and incomplete  she said  pointing to the increased susceptibility of landlocked countries to shocks  and to the heightened effects such shocks  had because of a lack of mitigation capacity.  She looked forward to the upcoming conference in Vienna  and expressed optimism about the outcome document intended to tackle landlocked countries’ problems  building on the Almaty Programme of Action.  A realistic Programme was needed and expectations were high.  Information and communications technology was an enabler for investment and growth  and it should be made affordable to landlocked developing countries.  Structural transformation was needed to improve competitiveness. ALASSANE CONTE (Guinea) aligning with the Group of 77 and China  the African Group and the Group of Least Developed Countries  noted that when the Millennium Development Goals were negotiated  no thought was given to the idea of evaluating implementation at the end of the process.  Despite progress on education  gender  nutrition and the campaign against HIV/AIDS  numerous challenges remained related to employment  economic growth and inequality.  Progress was uneven between countries.  Guinea had been making progress on poverty eradication  infant mortality  combating diseases  providing water access and gender equality prior to the outbreak of Ebola.  The international community failed to acknowledge the threat posed by the outbreak when it first occurred  but then reacted in panic  closing borders and applying restrictions.  That had slowed trade  reduced productivity and hampered sectors like tourism  as well as caused a reduction in the growth rate of about 1.5 per cent.  The international community had since recognized the need for robust support to combat what was one of the worst epidemics of the century.  But he called for increased efforts. ZAHIR TANIN (Afghanistan) associated himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Group of Least Developed Countries  citing his country’s particular concerns.  Those included the need for ODA to support development efforts  and the importance of technology and financing to implementing the sustainable development goals.  He looked forward to the outcome of the landlocked developing countries’ conference and to negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda  hoping that the results of United Nations conferences would guide deliberations.  He welcomed the first meeting of the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development  emphasized the importance of South-South and triangular cooperation  and stressed the vulnerability of least developed countries to climate change.  Several national policies aimed at achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2020  and the country was on track to achievement of many targets. E. COURTENAY RATTRAY (Jamaica)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  CARICOM  Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  and the Alliance of Small Island States  said that for his country it was imperative that the post-2015 agenda deliberations resulted in outcomes improving its citizens’ quality of life.  Moreover  the agenda must provide developing countries with opportunities to access and harness technologies that were the key enablers of sustainable development.  Jamaica had had first-hand experience with the damaging effects of natural hazards  including hurricanes  the frequency and severity of which had been exacerbated by climate change.  Therefore  it expected the new framework to improve upon the provisions of the Hyogo Framework for Action  and support vulnerable countries in their efforts to build resilience to natural hazards.  The issue of debt was of paramount importance to the small CARICOM economies  many of which continued to carry unsustainable debt burdens. XAVIER LASSO MENDOZA (Ecuador)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  urged the international community to reflect on the issue of sovereign debt  and stressed the importance of promoting financial cooperation.  The main challenge of the post-2015 development agenda would be the effectiveness of its implementation means  he said  calling for the agenda to recognize countries’ different challenges.  Moreover  urban development must be in line with the concept of living well and living peacefully with nature.  Finally  he highlighted the need to continue fighting for climate justice  and the importance of international migration and its undeniable link to development. The representative of Kuwait  supporting the statement made by Bolivia  said that drawing up the post-2015 development agenda could lead to the creation of partnerships that strengthened the spirit of the sustainable development goals.  Kuwait was one of the high revenue developed countries  and  as such  attached great importance to providing assistance to developing countries and least developed countries.  The Kuwait Fund for Development was one tool reflecting his country’s position  contributing to stabilization and cooperation between Kuwait and other countries.  Economic and investment cooperation was a pillar for cooperation and partnership in the area of development.  Participation by the private sector and civil society was also needed to make progress in the development process. MAUREEN FRANCELLA STRICKLAND-SIMONET (Samoa)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  Alliance of Small Island States  Pacific Small Island Developing States  and CARICOM  said the primary goal of hosting the third small island developing States’ conference was the opportunity to draw international attention to those countries and their challenges and realities.  She called the Samoa Pathway the blueprint for sustainable development of those States.  Her country looked forward to a renewed global partnership that would help small island developing States manage a multitude of risks  so that they could pursue inclusive economic growth  social development and environmental sustainability.  Moreover  she stressed the importance of establishing a robust global monitoring system that would strengthen the accountability at all levels  and ensure adequate and timely analysis and update of the Samoa Pathway implementation. FRED SARUFA (Papua New Guinea) spoke on behalf of the Pacific Small Island Developing States  and associated himself with the Alliance of Small Island States and the Group of 77 and China.  He said that the challenge for small island developing States was first and foremost to take ownership and strengthen leadership in the implementation of the Samoa Pathway.  That document must serve as a blueprint if those States were to achieve sustainable development in the post-2015 era.  Given those States’ lack of resources and other constraints  they would require assistance with the means of implementation.  Member States should be mindful of those countries’ development priorities  such as climate change  sustainability of fishing  conservation of marine biodiversity  and sustainable energy. Climate change remained a serious threat to small island developing States  he said  expressing his country’s concerns about the rapidly rising sea levels and greenhouse emissions.  He called for the application of the Rio principle of common but differentiated responsibilities  and for a full capitalization of the Green Climate Fund.  Finally  oceans and seas played a key role in the development of small island developing States  he said  calling for their health and productivity to be restored  and their sustainability included in the final framework. HELEN BECK (Solomon Islands) associated her statement with the Group of 77 and China  the Alliance of Small Island States  the African Group  and the Group of Pacific Small Island Developing States.  Welcoming the adoption of the Open Working Group’s report containing 17 “balanced” sustainable development goals  she noted that the document should not be renegotiated.  For sustainable development to grow roots  it must be nurtured with an inclusive international financial process.  Those most lagging behind must be given preferential treatment  and economic systems must work for all.  Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals remained unfinished business for many least developed countries.  Mitigation and adaptation to climate change must be inclusive and respond to the special needs of small island developing States and least developed countries.  Climate change had to remain at the forefront of the sustainable development path. KHALIL MOHAMAD (Lebanon) said that since the Rio +20 conference  the international community had highlighted the need for sustainable development goals to focus on environmentally responsible growth.  There were three main challenges and priorities of sustainable development  namely good governance  technological improvement  and public awareness.  Noting his country’s achievements on reaching economic equality  he added that Lebanon was witnessing mass migration of youth to cities.  Those remaining faced high unemployment  and that issue must be a crucial part of the post-2015 development agenda.  Touching on the impact of the Syrian conflict in his country  he noted the continuing impact of a marine oil spill in 2006 caused  he said  by Israel  adding that Israeli practices in the occupied Palestinian territory hindered human development there  which was unacceptable. BERNARDITO AUZA  Observer for the Holy See  welcomed progress to reduce poverty and child and maternal mortality.  Poverty eradication was the most important development goal to the Holy See  and he was concerned that extreme poverty remained widespread  despite recent progress.  Around 15 per cent of the world’s population lived on less than $1.25 per day.  To fight the structural causes of extreme poverty  each person had to be provided with the minimum wherewithal to live in dignity and freedom from want.  Climate change  rising inequality  employment  and the promotion of peaceful societies had to be part of the sustainable development goals  particularly as they affected people in extreme poverty the most. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-08,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gadis3498.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Although nuclear weapons had not been engaged since 1945  the world “cannot rely on luck indefinitely”  the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) heard today as it continued its general debate. The representative of Switzerland  noting that the United Nations had sought to eliminate nuclear weapons since its establishment  said it was everyone’s responsibility to maintain that commitment.  Despite progress in some fields  he said  highlighting the Arms Trade Treaty  the use of nuclear rhetoric amid global tension and the inclusion of nuclear capabilities as part of military exercises were “worrying” developments. More than four decades since the entry into force of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  non-nuclear-weapon States had a right to ask “if not now  when?”  said New Zealand’s representative. Echoing sentiments expressed by the High Representative for Disarmament Affairs  she said that despite all that was wrong in the world — armed conflicts  arms races  and the orgy of military spending — disarmament did have a future and would survive for two reasons: it worked  and it was the right thing to do. Disarmament did not happen in a vacuum  the representative of the Russian Federation said  adding that the future of that process depended to a great extent on the general security environment.  Without the elimination of negative factors  the hopes for advancement towards “nuclear zero” would remain wishful thinking. That representative also expressed concern about the concept of “prompt global strike”  which was getting closer to the practical implementation phase.  The goal was to immediately neutralize the defence capabilities of any “out-of-favour” country  leaving it without any time or opportunity for an armed response. France’s representative said that nuclear proliferation was a profound concern  and the European continent  which was thought to be permanently at peace  was once again prey to tensions.  The Ukrainian crisis and the violation of the 1994 Budapest memorandum  adopted in the framework of Ukraine’s accession to the NPT  had a “very negative effect” on international security  he said. There was a sequence for multilateral action  with the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the launch of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty  he said  adding that to make progress  it was essential to better understand each State’s position  minimize divergences and identify possible avenues for compromise. Sharing the worry of several delegations in the room  the representative of the Republic of Korea pointed out that  despite recent efforts  the possibility of nuclear terrorism remained a grave threat to international peace and security. Brunei Darussalam’s delegate added that the advancement of other weapons of mass destruction  particularly chemical and biological  were readily available in many countries and were now possible alternatives for terrorists.  It was imperative  therefore  for the international community to ensure that counter-measures kept pace with the increasingly sophisticated methods for procuring such weapons. Also speaking were the representatives of Belarus  Cuba  Israel  Mongolia  Malaysia  Algeria  Libya  Australia  Spain  Denmark and Senegal. Exercising their right of reply were the representatives of Syria and Israel. The First Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. tomorrow  9 October  to continue its general debate. Background The First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) met this morning to continue its general debate on all related agenda items before it.  For background  see Press Release GA/DIS/3497. Statements VALENTIN RYBAKOV  Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus  called for the universal adherence to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)  saying that  without the participation of all countries  the international community would remain far from reaching the goal of staunching proliferation.  Implementation of the NPT had shown little progress to date  he said  pointing in particular to the lack of implementation of the 2010 NPT Review Conference Action Plan.  Ahead of the 2015 NPT Review Conference  the international community must ensure that the outcome was not a “vague compromise” that merely reprinted the 2010 document. Instead  delegates must be courageous and work towards a specific framework. Despite that  he said  the moratorium on nuclear testing was undoubtedly a step forward; however  it had a voluntary  de facto nature that made for a very fragile mechanism. Instead of relying on voluntary initiatives  the international community must aim for legally binding mechanisms.  With that  he urged the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). To build a world free from nuclear tests  non-participating States must join the Treaty. Without universal participation  the CTBT could not be effective. Non-proliferation and the absence of nuclear tests were steps in the right direction  but were not an end in themselves. The ultimate goal should be the total  irreversible  elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. He noted that Belarus had been the first State in post-Soviet area to have renounced  voluntarily and without any precondition  possession of operational nuclear weapons deployed on its territory. In a similar vein  his country planned to table the traditional resolution on the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction. OSCAR LE Ó N GONZ Á LEZ (Cuba)  supporting the statement made on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  urged the start of negotiations on a comprehensive convention on nuclear weapons to prohibit their production  stockpiling  transfer  and threat of use  and to stipulate their destruction. An international  high-level conference on the matter should be held no later than 2018  aimed at eliminating those weapons in the shortest possible timeframe. Cuba was proud to belong to the first densely populated area in the world to have declared itself nuclear-weapon free  through the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean  known as the Treaty of Tlatelolco. He said the only guarantee for the non-use of nuclear weapons was their full elimination and prohibition under strict international control. For that reason  it was unacceptable that deterrence remained the bedrock of military doctrines. Nuclear Powers continued to develop their arsenals via vertical proliferation  which was not highlighted enough by the international community. There remained a great distance between rhetoric and good intentions  as well as between commitments and the steps States were willing to take. A treaty should be concluded without delay to protect non-nuclear weapon States from the use  or threat of use  of nuclear weapons against them. It was also deeply unfortunate that a conference  as agreed  to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East had not yet been held. The zone’s establishment would be a monumental step forward in the peace process in that region. He reiterated the call for concrete steps towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons  adding that multilateral efforts were the only way to achieve that. EYAL PROPPER  Deputy Head of the Division for Strategic Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel  said that the Middle East lacked mechanisms to foster dialogue and greater understanding between regional players. Because of the refusal of some countries to recognize Israel  there were no processes that could contribute to building confidence  de-escalation of tensions and conflict resolution. He lamented the lack of forums for direct communication between the States of the region  able to address core security issues and encourage the attainment of solutions. The Middle East had distinguished itself by blatant violations and a lack of respect for formal treaty obligations. Within the context of the NPT  four out of five violations had occurred to date in his region  notably in Iran  Syria  Libya and Iraq. Dialogue was essential to achieve peace and security in the region  and urged a “pragmatic and realistic approach”. Israel  for its part  had reiterated its willingness to participate in a sixth round of consultations  convened by the Finnish Under-Secretary  to discuss the conditions necessary for establishing a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction  he said. Regretfully  however  there was a “significant conceptual gap” between regional States on fundamental security concepts. While Israel had sought a consensus-based approach  its neighbours had yet to adopt the same pragmatism. In their efforts to impose such a zone  Arab countries refused to engage Israel directly and establish a path towards convening a conference in Helsinki. He went on to state that Iran remained the “cardinal threat” to the region’s security. In its unrelenting pursuit of developing nuclear-weapon capability and advancing its regional ambitions  the country supported terrorist organizations with the supply of weapons  financing and training. He warned that the election of the “so-called moderates” in Iran and the emergence of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS) should not lead the international community to underestimate the threat still posed by Iran. That country participated in processes such as the “E3+3” talks to alleviate pressures and “buy more time” for development of its military programme  he alleged. There was still no clear indication of the country’s intention to curb its nuclear capabilities  as demanded by several Security Council resolutions. MIKHAIL ULYANOV (Russian Federation) said that the elimination of the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction  including nuclear weapons  remained one of the international community’s key priorities. The Russian Federation was actively working in that direction by taking concrete steps to limit and reduce nuclear arsenals. Over the past 25 years  those stocks had been reduced “manifold”  and under the new START treaty  his country had set out a goal to reach the agreed aggregate levels of warheads  delivery means and launchers by early 2018  which was achievable. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) of 1987  between the Russian Federation and the United States  also remained in effect. However  Russia’s “American partners” had committed “gross and massive” violations of that instrument’s obligations. He hoped  as a result of the dialogue on those issues  that the United States would return to full compliance with that important accord. Disarmament did not happen in a vacuum  he said  as the future of that process depended to a great extent on the general security environment. Without the elimination of negative factors  the hopes for advancement towards “nuclear zero” would remain wishful thinking. His delegation had growing concerns about the concept of “prompt global strike”  which was getting closer to the practical implementation phase. The goal was to immediately neutralize the defence capabilities of any “out of favour” country  leaving it without any time or opportunity for an armed response. Such research efforts were even riskier when undertaken in the context of the policy towards establishing one’s exclusiveness and overwhelming military supremacy. Regarding “nuclear sharing” among the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries  in which non-nuclear members of the alliance accepted nuclear weapons on their territory and participated in the planning of their use  he said that was incompatible  with either the letter or spirit of the NPT. That Treaty’s article I prohibited the transfer of nuclear weapons to any recipient whatsoever  directly or indirectly. He called on NATO members to bring their policy into compliance with their obligations. Turning to the “chemical demilitarization” in Syria  he said that had been one of the major achievements in the area of weapons of mass destruction non-proliferation and disarmament. Syrian authorities had eliminated chemical arsenals under unprecedentedly difficult conditions and were in full compliance with their obligations. Thus  the so-called “Syrian chemical dossier” was no longer an urgent matter  and should be considered under regular procedures of the Organisation of the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. OH JOON  Republic of Korea  said that the CTBT’s entry into force and negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty remained the two most urgent tasks to be tackled together by the international community. His country urged the remaining eight “Annex 2” States  whose ratification was required for the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty’s entry into force  to do so without delay. He also reiterated his country’s long-standing call for the commencement of negotiations on a fissile material ban in the Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament  and was hopeful that the Group of Governmental Experts could pave the way forward. He said that  despite recent efforts  the possibility of nuclear terrorism remained a grave threat to international peace and security. Building upon the landmark Washington and Seoul Summits  the 2014 Hague Nuclear Security Summit was a crucial step forward in global efforts to prevent such activities. As the host of the 2012 Summit  his country would continue to work with others in establishing a robust and enduring nuclear security architecture.  The United Nations had an important role to play  he said  stressing that Member States should step up their efforts to achieve the full and universal implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004)  which aimed to prevent the transfer of mass destruction weapons to terrorists.  Another serious threat to international peace and security was the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s continued development of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programmes  he said  noting that the “DPRK” was the only country in the twenty-first century that had conducted nuclear tests.  Further development of its nuclear capabilities continued  and the “DPRK” was now threatening a new form of nuclear testing. Already  the international community had condemned the ballistic missiles it had launched this year as clear violations of Security Council resolutions. As such  the world must send a clear and united message to that country that  under no circumstances  could it become a nuclear-weapon State and that subsequent tests by the country would be met with serious consequences. JEAN-HUGUES SIMON-MICHEL (France) expressed “immense satisfaction” that the Arms Trade Treaty had now passed the necessary threshold for entry into force at the end of this year.  Crises continued around the world  and  in some cases  were breaking out anew  such as in the Middle East  Central African Republic  Libya and Iraq.  The effects of those conflicts were felt even in Europe  and were a reminder that “we live in the real world” and that the approach to disarmament and arms control should be realistic.  Nuclear proliferation remained a central concern  and the European continent  which was thought to be permanently at peace  was once again prey to tensions.  The Ukrainian crisis and the violation of the 1994 Budapest memorandum  adopted in the framework of Ukraine’s accession to the NPT  had a “very negative effect” on international security. Yet  despite the degradation of the international strategic context  disarmament and arms control had made progress in 2014  he said.  In addition to the Arms Trade Treaty  there was also the success of the Maputo review conference of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention  and pragmatic solutions had been proposed to address the problem of space debris.  However  nuclear-weapon States needed to “be equal to their commitments”  and France was aware of its responsibilities in that respect.  The road map agreed at the 2010 NPT Review Conference constituted a common approach that committed all States parties to a “step-by-step” approach.  There was a sequence for multilateral action  with the entry into force of the CTBT and the launch of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty.  To make progress  it was essential to better understand each State’s position  minimize divergences and identify possible avenues for compromise.  France’s aim remained  more than ever  to move on to the next stage and begin negotiations; debates held this year at the Conference on Disarmament were moving things in that direction. The step-by-step approach was the only realistic path and would allow determined pursuit of a safer world. OD OCH (Mongolia) agreed with previous speakers that the NPT was the cornerstone of the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime  and an “essential part of the global security regime” overall.  Mongolia joined the call on all States parties to “spare no effort” in achieving the Treaty’s universality.  The full and effective implementation of all provisions was required to preserve its relevance  effectiveness and credibility.  As a strong advocate of nuclear-weapon-free zones  Mongolia was concerned about the lack of implementation of the 1995 Middle East resolution  but was hopeful that international efforts would yield progress in establishing such a zone in the Middle East. He went on to state that Mongolia — recognizing the Conference on Disarmament as the single  multilateral  negotiating body on disarmament — was hopeful  as its co-chair in 2015  that the necessary political will would be created to ensure the commencement of substantive work.  Looking ahead  innovative approaches must be explored to make possible the resumption of meaningful disarmament negotiations.  On the CTBT  Mongolia stressed the importance of maintaining a moratorium on all types of nuclear weapon tests; however  unless the Treaty was legally binding  it would remain fragile.  It was for that reason Mongolia joined the Joint Ministerial Statement on the CTBT to speed up ratifications. The potential spread of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery means constituted a threat to international peace and security  he said  adding that  as a result  Mongolia has been undertaking efforts to promote the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by joining all major international frameworks and abiding by its obligation under relevant agreements. BENNO LAGGNER (Switzerland) said that preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and achieving a world free of those weapons must remain the objective of steadfast pursuit by the international community.  The United Nations had sought their elimination since the Organization’s establishment  and it was everyone’s responsibility to maintain that commitment. His delegation was deeply concerned by the slow pace of nuclear disarmament  the lack of decisive change in nuclear doctrines and the qualitative development of those weapons.  The use of nuclear rhetoric amid international tension and the inclusion of nuclear capabilities as part of military exercises  as well as questions on the future of the INF Treaty  were all worrying developments and a reminder that  although nuclear weapons had not been engaged since 1945  the world “cannot rely on luck indefinitely”. He said that conferences on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons had clearly demonstrated that the explosion of a single such weapon would have catastrophic consequences.  All States should take part in those summits  because nuclear weapons affected all.  He sought greater efforts to further implementation of the 2010 NPT Action Plan  and dossiers as essential as the establishment of a zone free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East.  Regarding the conflict in Syria  he welcomed efforts made to guarantee the neutralization of chemical weapons stockpiles; however  he remained extremely concerned about the interim conclusions of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons’ (OPCW) fact-finding mission that toxic chemicals had been used repeatedly in Syria. While mass destruction weapons required immediate attention  he said in closing  conventional weapons still claimed numerous victims each year.  As such  the rapid entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty was crucial. HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia)  said that greater public awareness was required on the issue of nuclear disarmament  with more attention paid to the calls of civil society.  “Fresh perspectives and innovative approaches” should be considered by expanding the number of stakeholders in the disarmament discourse.  That could provide opportunities for achieving the desired changes.  Government representatives must live up to their commitments.  For its part  Malaysia reaffirmed its commitment to pursue a world free of nuclear weapons  as embodied in the NPT.  On that note  he emphasized the urgent need to convene a conference on a zone free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. On the Conference on Disarmament  he said that the priorities must be rationalized in that consideration of one issue should not be a precondition for proceeding on another.  Nor should members be fixated on the consensus rule.  Instead  efforts should focus on constructive proposals for improving the Conference’s working methods.  As its president in 2014  Malaysia would present the report and the draft resolution to the First Committee during the cluster on disarmament machinery.  While the Conference worked to overcome its impasse  Malaysia remained convinced that a convention on nuclear weapons was long overdue.  In 2007  his country  together with Costa Rica  had submitted a model nuclear weapons convention to the General Assembly  which set out legal  technical and political elements for rendering the world nuclear-weapon-free.  As such  his country stood ready to work with other Member States on the model convention  or on any other proposal that would bring the world closer to that goal. SABRI BOUKADOUM (Algeria)  associating himself with the Arab Group  African Union and Non-Aligned Movement  said that effective steps and substantive progress in the area of disarmament remained elusive.  Nuclear disarmament was Algeria’s highest priority  out of concern for the dangers those weapons posed to humanity.  His country was committed to the NPT as the cornerstone of the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime  but it must be universalized.  Nuclear-weapon States had the primary responsibility to achieve nuclear disarmament  and he called for effective implementation of General Assembly resolution 68/32  including the urgent commencement of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament for the early conclusion of a comprehensive convention on nuclear weapons to prohibit their possession  development  production  acquisition  testing  stockpiling  transfer  use or threat of use and to provide for their destruction. Noting that a majority of NPT States parties had chosen to use atomic energy for exclusively civilian applications in line with the Treaty’s article IV  he said that  for many developing countries  nuclear energy represented a strategic choice for their economic development and energy security needs.  Accordingly  Algeria reaffirmed the legitimate right to develop  research and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.  He noted that his country had been among the first to sign the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty  or Pelindaba Treaty  but he regretted that a conference to create such a zone in the Middle East had not yet been held.  With regard to the Conference on Disarmament  he said the continuing impasse was a result of a lack of political will.  To address that deadlock  he urged the convening of a fourth special session of the General Assembly. On conventional weapons  he said that the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons continued to threaten the peace and stability of many countries and regions.  That illicit trade  particularly in North Africa and the Sahel region  involved the supply of arms to terrorist groups and organized crime networks.  Thus  the United Nations Programme of Action and the International Tracing Instrument were more than ever of the utmost relevance. IBRAHIM O. A. DABBASHI (Libya) said that his country sought the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and believed that the total elimination of nuclear weapons was the only guarantee that they would not be used in the future.  In 2003  Libya had renounced its programme on nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction  and had also pledged to eliminate chemical weapons by 2015.  Libya was hopeful that other States would follow in its footsteps and urged  in particular  nuclear-weapon States to honour the NPT. Libya welcomed the adoption of General Assembly resolution 68/32 on nuclear disarmament and believed that implementation of all of its provisions would make it effective towards achieving the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. Non-adherence to existing instruments was a threat to international peace  he said  noting that Libya favoured a convention on nuclear weapons as that could pave the way for a nuclear-weapon free zone in the Middle East. Pending that  however  the international community must put pressure on Israel as the only country in the region that was not a party to the NPT. He went on to stress the importance of the universality of the CTBT  which could help achieve the “noble goal” of ridding the world of nuclear weapons. Libya respected the right of NPT States parties to produce nuclear energy for peaceful purposes  adding  however  that a balance must be maintained with the important commitments outlined in the Treaty. Libya also supported nuclear-weapon-free zones in all four corners of the world and called on all parties to redouble their efforts to implement the outcomes of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference. He stressed that there was a vital need to revitalize the Conference on Disarmament  which had an important role to play as a negotiating platform in nuclear disarmament. On conventional weapons  Libya had signed the Arms Trade Treaty to help prevent the infiltration of those weapons in civil conflicts around the world. DELL HIGGIE (New Zealand) said that implementing the Arms Trade Treaty would prove key to reaping the human security and development outcomes expected to flow from it.  All could be heartened by the Treaty’s success story  which  thanks to civil society’s ongoing support and attentive eye  would continue to go from strength to strength.  Less heartening  however  was the lack of progress on the First Committee’s key item  namely  nuclear disarmament.  Not all United Nations Member States based their approaches to nuclear weapons issues on the NPT  but an overwhelming number of States did so  in steadfast support of that Treaty as the cornerstone of their disarmament and non-proliferation policies.  Yet  unfinished business remained.  More than four decades since the NPT entered into force  non-nuclear-weapon States had a right to ask: “if not now  when?” She stressed the need for human security  rather than war strategies  to be at the core of the international community’s deliberations on nuclear weapons issues.  Wishing to draw from the optimism of the United Nations High Representative for Disarmament Affairs  Angela Kane  she echoed the sentiment that  despite all that was wrong in the world — armed conflicts  arms races  and the orgy of military spending — disarmament did have a future and would survive for two reasons: it worked  and it was the right thing to do. SHARMAN STONE  (Australia)  said that the past year had seen important progress in the implementation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions and the Mine Ban Convention. Citing the tragic impact on civilians of cluster munitions and anti-personnel mines  Australia urged adherence to international norms established by those Conventions and welcomed the recent United States’ announcement of further changes to more closely align the country’s activities “outside the Korean peninsula” with the key requirements of the Mine Ban Convention. In order to remove the threat of nuclear war  it was incumbent upon all to diminish the utility of those weapons  she said  adding that the starting point of the disarmament process must be the inclusion of nuclear-armed States.  Some  including the United States and Russian Federation  have made considerable reductions in their nuclear arsenals  and yet  with more than 16 000 nuclear weapons in the hands of nine States  “much more needs to be done”. There could be no short-cuts to create the conditions necessary for a world without nuclear weapons  and to that end  Australia and fellow members of the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative (NPDI) proposed practical steps to contribute to greater nuclear transparency and further reductions. It welcomed the recent report regarding the NPT  but sought more detail and transparency in those documents. Another priority of Australia was the entry into force of the Test-Ban Treaty  she said  noting that  last month  her country had co-hosted a ministerial meeting  which committed to a strong statement of support for the Treaty’s prompt entry into force. Along with Mexico and New Zealand  Australia would present the annual CTBT resolution during this year’s First Committee session  and she invited broad support to reinforce the need to maintain a testing moratorium. MARIA VICTORIA GONZÁLEZ ROMÁN (Spain)  associating with the European Union  said that in the past few years the international community had made several achievements in two important areas of disarmament  the nuclear and conventional weapons realms.  Progress was still needed in other areas  however  including in the Conference on Disarmament and the inability to begin negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty.  Still  the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty was a milestone in the field of international relations  and the control of arms exports was now linked to human rights and the need to maintain peace  stability and international security. The comprehensive development of the NPT entailed progress in the compliance with article VI  she said  welcoming the bilateral agreements between the United States and the Russian Federation to reduce their strategic nuclear weapons.  The CTBT would surely be another fundamental component in the disarmament and non-proliferation architecture  when it entered into force.  She called on States that had not yet signed or ratified the Treaty  in particular Annex 2 States  to do so as soon as possible.  She highlighted the importance for compliance by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea with Security Council resolutions  and urged it to negotiate in good faith an agreement that would banish the nuclear threat from the Korean peninsula.  She supported efforts under way to reach a diplomatic solution in the case of Iran  and welcomed the collaboration that had characterized the negotiations which began last November.  Finally  she underscored the importance of strengthening security in the face of possible biological threats  be they natural  accidental or criminal. SUSANNE RUMOHR HAEKKERUP (Denmark) was encouraged by the upcoming entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty  but said that was only the beginning. More work was needed on its implementation  including addressing questions regarding the regulation of transport between so-called “third party” countries  and how to convince major arms sellers to sign  ratify and implement the text.  There was no room for complacency  as the uncontrolled and illegal arms trade destabilized countries and entire regions; that was at the root of intolerable human suffering. The tragic developments in East Ukraine  Syria and Iran had underlined the need to control the small arms and lights weapons proliferation. As one of the world’s leading shipping nations  Denmark felt a “special responsibility” in the issues of arms transport  which remained largely unregulated globally.  It was  thus  critical to ensure a level playing field and not put companies that are “doing the right thing” at a disadvantage. Denmark looked forward to the Conference of State Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty next year as a model for effective and pragmatic international cooperation. This year  coordinated efforts had brought important progress in areas of non-proliferation and the reduction of the threat of weapons of mass destruction  she said  noting the unprecedented global efforts towards the full elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons and production facilities. Denmark played a key role by providing vessels for the maritime operation charged with transporting chemical weapons from Syria for overseas neutralization and destruction. In that context  her country was deeply disturbed by recent reports about the continued use of chemical agents in Syria and fully supported efforts by the OPCW and others to shed light on the facts. DATO ABDUL GHAFAR ISMAIL (Brunei Darussalam)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  stressed the importance of nuclear non-proliferation at both regional and global levels.  At the regional level  his country was a State party to the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone Treaty  or Bangkok Treaty  and at the global level  had ratified the CTBT. Furthermore  his country had become the 162nd member of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  which signified its commitment to support nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation  as well as to the peaceful uses of nuclear technology and energy. He expressed deep concern over the advancement of other weapons of mass destruction  particularly chemical and biological  which were readily available in many countries. It was alarming that those were now possible alternatives for terrorists. It was imperative  therefore  for the international community to ensure that counter-measures kept pace with the increasingly sophisticated methods for procuring such weapons. He reiterated his country’s full commitment for the non-proliferation of all types of nuclear and other mass destruction weapons and their delivery systems  and would continue to support international cooperation  peaceful settlement of disputes  dialogue and confidence-building measures. FODE SECK (Senegal) said nuclear disarmament negotiations were mired in an “unprecedented paralysis”  pointing to the lack of consensus by the Preparatory Committee for the 2015 NPT Review Conference as an example.  Another stumbling block for nuclear disarmament was the lack of progress towards establishing the framework for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East.  Senegal supported the complete elimination of those weapons as the only way to ensure peace.  The “constant threat to humanity” they posed made it imperative for any State that had not yet signed the NPT or CTBT to do so without delay.  He reiterated the role of the Conference for Disarmament as a unique  multilateral  negotiating body  and urged the prevention of an arms race in outer space. Concerning chemical weapons  he urged States that had not yet signed that Convention to do so as soon as possible.  Regarding the NPT  he underscored the inalienable right of States parties to engage in nuclear energy research and production for peaceful means  as long as those activities were under the IAEA’s control.  On conventional weapons  Senegal welcomed the coming entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty  but called for a balanced approach to implementation that would protect the rights of all  and not just those of the nuclear-armed States.  He called for greater control of small arms and light weapons  which had devastating effects on developing countries  particularly in Africa. On the issue of cluster munitions  he called for the universalisation of that Convention and encouraged other States to ratify it ahead of the First Review Conference in Croatia in September 2015.  With the support of the international community and the National Anti-Mine Action Centre  Senegal continued efforts to rid the country of landmines  he noted. Right of Reply Speaking in exercise of the right of reply  Syria’s delegate said that the “representative of the French regime” had made baseless allegations against his country  when it was France that had introduced nuclear weapons to the Middle East and even tested them on human beings. French terrorists were committing the most heinous crimes against civilians in Syria  which France did not address. Syria genuinely sought a Syrian-based solution to ongoing problems. However  France did not acknowledge the recent use of chemical weapons by ISIS  which showed that terrorist groups possessed such capabilities. That posed a threat to Syria  the region  and the whole world. He said his country had met its commitments with the OPCW  and he could not understand the “flagrant audacity” with which the Israeli representative had talked about weapons in the Middle East  when Israel was the only possessor of nuclear weapons in the region. The representative of Israel said that to say the Syrian Government had not been fully open about its chemical weapons programme would be “the understatement of the century”. The international community had discovered chemical weapons facilities that the Assad regime had failed to declare  and he joined others in continuing to put pressure on the Syrian regime to fully reveal that programme. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-08,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaab4120.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) today approved a consensus draft resolution that allowed four countries to retain their voting rights despite failing to pay their annual contribution to the Organization. Under Article 19 of the United Nations Charter  a Member State is not allowed to vote in the General Assembly if its arrears equal or exceed the amount due from the preceding two years. By the terms of the draft  approved without a vote  the Assembly would agree that the Comoros  Guinea-Bissau  Sao Tome and Principe  and Somalia had failed to pay the minimum contribution due to conditions beyond their control and therefore could continue voting until the end of the Assembly’s sixty-ninth session. In other business  the Committee began its examination of the United Nations system-wide financial health. Introducing the statistical report of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) (document A/69/305)  Kenneth Herman  Senior Advisor on Information Management Policy Coordination of the CEB Secretariat  said that it was “the only” system-wide source of financial statistics  with 35 organizations providing staff cost and other data. He said that in its 2009 resolution on system-wide coherence  the Assembly had requested creation of a central repository of information on operational activities for development  including disaggregated data on all funding sources and expenditures and to ensure user-friendly online access and regular updates.  The CEB Secretariat worked closely with the Department of Economic and Social Affairs to harmonize data collection and reporting processes. By establishing one data collection mechanism  he continued  the umbrella organizations’ reporting workload had been greatly reduced.  The report now contained a focus on the budgetary implications of adjustments to all elements of staff costs  including salaries  cost-of-living adjustments  allowances  benefits  pension and insurance  for the most recent and subsequent calendar years. To further improve transparency  he said  revenue was broken down by four major categories:  assessed contributions  non-earmarked voluntary contributions  earmarked voluntary contributions  and revenue from other activities.  Expenses were reported by five major programme categories:  development assistance  humanitarian assistance  technical cooperation  peacekeeping operations and normative  treaty-related and knowledge creation activities.  The CEB database now contained comprehensive data on six consecutive biennia  from 2002-2003 through 2012-2013. The Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. on Thursday  9 October  to consider its agenda items on:  improving the United Nations financial situation; activities of the Office of Internal Oversight Services and the Independent Audit Advisory Committee; and international public sector accounting standards.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-07,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaab4119.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) today approved by consensus a draft resolution to provide nearly $50 million for the United Nations operations to control the Ebola outbreak. The newly established United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) was already operating in West Africa with more than 50 staff members. The $49.9 million earmarked for UNMEER  the Organization’s first-ever emergency health mission  would be provided until the end of December.  The Mission was being guided by the Global Strategic Response Plan developed by the Office of the Special Envoy on Ebola  in consultation with the World Health Organization (WHO). General Assembly President Sam Kutesa said the resolution demonstrated the Organization’s ability to deliver on pressing global issues and the fact that the Ebola outbreak carried serious economic  social and security consequences  particularly in West Africa. The Committee then began its annual discussion of the scale of assessments  a complex methodology used to determine each Member State’s financial contributions to the United Nations budget and its “capacity to pay”.  The scale’s methodology is periodically reviewed to reflect the concerns of Member States as well as shifting economic conditions. The representative of the European Union said the current methodology produced a scale that no longer accurately reflected a country’s ability to pay.  The low per capita income adjustment had become the most significant element for redistributing assessments.  Yet it helped the poorest Member States  those in real need of the adjustment  to a limited extent. China’s delegate said the methodology in use should strictly follow the “capacity to pay” principle  and her Government opposed any attempts to change the treatment of the low per capita income adjustment.  China’s assessed contributions had doubled over the past decade  she noted. Echoing that sentiment  Bolivia’s delegate  representing the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  rejected any changes to the methodology’s elements that aimed to increase the contributions of developing countries.  The Group also emphasized that the core elements of the current methodology — such as base period  gross national income  conversion rates  low per capita income adjustment  and ceiling for least developed countries — were not negotiable. Secretariat staff also introduced relevant reports on this financial issue. Bernardo Greiver  Chair of the Committee on Contributions  presented the report of his Committee  a technical body that prepares the scale of assessments for each Member State using reliable  verifiable and comparable data.  In that report  the Committee reaffirmed its recommendation that the scale of assessments should be based on the most current  comprehensive and comparable data available for gross national income. Lionel Berridge  Chief of Contributions and Policy Coordination Service  introduced the Secretary-General’s report on multi-year payment plans  which summed up the status of the payment plans as of 31 December 2013.  Mr. Berridge said that Sao Tome and Principe had made a payment under its plan in May 2014  which was reported to the Committee on Contributions at its June 2014 session.  No new payment plans had been submitted recently  though the issue was under consideration by several Member States. The Committee then turned to budget issues. Ramadhan Mwinyi  Chair of the Committee for Programme and Coordination  introduced that body’s report on its June session.  Johannes Huisman  Director of Programme Planning and Budget Division at the Department of Management’s Office of Programme Planning  Budget and Accounts  presented the framework for the biennial programme budget proposals for 2016-2017. Mario Baez  Chief of Policy and Oversight Coordination Service in the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Management  presented the Secretariat report on the programme performance of the United Nations for the biennium 2012-2013.  Prepared by the Department of Management  the report discussed implementation of the Organization’s 33 696 outputs and provided an overview of the results for 876 expected accomplishments. Also speaking at today’s meeting were delegates of Japan and Malaysia. The Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. Wednesday  8 October  to discuss the administration and budgetary coordination of the United Nations specialized agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  and to consider a draft resolution on the scale of assessments. Scale of assessments for the apportionment of United Nations expenses BERNARDO GREIVER  Chair of the Committee on Contributions  introduced the report of the Committee on Contributions on its seventy-fourth session (documents A/69/11 and Add. 1).  In it  the Committee reaffirmed its recommendation that the scale of assessments should be based on the most current  comprehensive and comparable data available for gross national income.  The gross national income data received from Member States in their national currencies had to be converted to a common monetary unit through the use of conversion rates.  The Committee reaffirmed its recommendation that conversion rates based on market exchange rates should be used for the scale of assessments  except in cases where that would cause excessive fluctuations and distortions in the gross national income  expressed in United States dollars  of some Member States.  In that case  price-adjusted rates of exchange or other appropriate conversion rates should be applied.  Income data expressed in United States dollars was to be averaged over a designated base period  the result of a compromise that used the average of data from both a three-year and six-year base period  he said.  Based on its review  the Committee agreed that  once chosen  there were advantages in using the same base period for as long as possible.  He noted that the current methodology included a maximum assessment rate  or ceiling  of 22 per cent; a maximum rate for the least developed countries  or LDC ceiling  of 0.010 per cent; and a minimum assessment rate  or floor  of 0.001 per cent.  The Committee decided to further consider these elements in the light of guidance from the General Assembly. LIONEL BERRIDGE  Chief of Contributions and Policy Coordination Service  introduced the Secretary-General’s report on multi-year payment plans (document A/69/70)  which summarized the status of such plans as of 31 December 2013.  When created  it was considered a useful tool for Member States to reduce their unpaid assessed contributions  and a way for them to demonstrate their commitment to meeting their financial obligations.  Since the establishment of the system  six Member States had successfully implemented multi-year payment plans.  The report contained the status of implementation of the remaining plan submitted by Sao Tome and Principe  which later made a payment.  No new payment plans had been submitted in recent years  although several Member States had indicated that the matter was under consideration. DAYANA ANGELA RIOS REQUENA (Bolivia)  speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  reaffirmed its long-standing position that all Member States should fulfil their legal obligations to bear the expenses of the Organization in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the requirement to pay their assessed contributions in full  on time and without conditions.  The Group emphasized the importance of dealing with the issue of exemptions under Article 19 on an urgent basis  and had reviewed the requests by the Comoros  Guinea-Bissau  Sao Tome and Principe  and Somalia.  The Group  convinced their inability to make the minimum payments on their assessed contributions was due to conditions beyond their control  endorsed the Committee’s recommendation to permit those countries to vote until the end of the sixty-ninth session. The Group reaffirmed the “capacity to pay” as the fundamental criterion in the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations and rejected any change to the elements of the current methodology for the preparation of the scale of assessments aimed at increasing the contributions of developing countries.  The Group also emphasized that the core elements of current methodology — such as base period  gross national income  conversion rates  low per capita income adjustment  gradient  floor  ceiling for Least Developed Countries  and debt stock adjustment — had to be kept intact and were not negotiable. FRANCESCO PRESUTTI  a representative of the European Union Delegation  argued that the current methodology resulted in a scale that no longer accurately reflected the capacity to pay  and that had been expressly recognized by General Assembly resolution 67/238 of 24 December 2012.  The low per capita income adjustment had become the largest element for redistributing assessments among Member States  and benefited only to a limited extent the poorer Member States that were in real need of the adjustment.  Funding the Organization was the joint responsibility of its entire membership and was essential to its sustainability and effective functioning  he said.  There was still room to improve the methodology  if it was to reflect a more equitable and balanced distribution of the financial responsibilities among Member States according to their capacity to pay.  As for requests for exemption  the Union had constantly stressed that the payment of assessed contributions in full  on time and without conditions was a fundamental duty of all Member States. SHIGETOSHI NAGAO (Japan) supported the basic principle that each Member State should pay its assessed contribution according to its capacity to pay.  Taking into account the world’s changing economic situation  Japan believed it was necessary to find a methodology that would better reflect each Member State’s real and current capacity in a more equitable way  based on the most current  comprehensive and comparable data available.  Japan would like to actively participate in the coming negotiation process so as to reach a consensus on how to maintain the Organization’s future sustainability.  Japan endorsed the Committee’s recommendations regarding exemptions  and encouraged all Members States in arrears under Article 19 to consider submitting multi-year payment plans. GUO ZHIQUI (China)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  stressed that the establishment of the scale of assessments should strictly follow the “capacity to pay” principle  which had been consistently observed in the Assembly.  All proposals on methodology should conform to that principle.  She opposed some delegations’ attempts to change the treatment of the low per capita income adjustment. China’s assessed contributions had doubled over the past decade to 5.148 per cent of the regular budget.  While seeking to cut overhead expenditures of its own Government  China paid $134 million annually to the United Nations under the current rate. HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia) supported an equitable and balanced methodology of the scale of assessments and expressed his Government’s resolve to shoulder 0.281 per cent of the regular budget.  He urged Member States to take advantage of the multi-year payment scheme as a way to reduce their unpaid assessments.  While stressing the validity of the “capacity to pay” principle  he also supported the work of the Committee on Contributions in improving the current methodology  with the objective of collecting higher contributions from both developed and developing countries.  The Committee should  however  consider the views of developing countries  which had limited capacity to pay.  Some countries  such as Comoros  Guinea-Bissau  Sao Tome and Principe  and Somalia  were unable to share their budgetary responsibility due to prevailing security  political and economic challenges.  Those nations should be allowed to vote in the Assembly’s current session. United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response The Committee then approved by consensus a draft resolution on the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) (document A/C.5/69/L.2)  under its agenda item on the programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015. SAM KUTESA (Uganda)  President of the General Assembly  said the resolution sent a strong message that the Organization could effectively deliver on pressing global issues.  The Ebola outbreak had serious economic  social and security consequences  particularly in West Africa.  The crisis required bold action on the part of the international community to control the virus  contain its spread and prevent additional deaths.  The virus had created grave dangers for the region and the community  and was an international crisis.  The establishment of UNMEER was the first step in necessary action.  More efforts were needed  including financial assistance and medical help.  UNMEER would provide a way to coordinate actions and build momentum. Programme Planning RAMADHAN MWINYI  Chair of the Committee for Programme and Coordination  introduced the report of the Committee for Programme and Coordination on its fifty-fourth session (document A/69/16)  which summarized its activities during that session held in June.  The Committee considered the report of the Secretary-General on the programme performance of the United Nations for the biennium 2012-2013 as well as part one  plan outline  of the proposed strategic framework for the period 2016-2017. He said the Committee also considered the following documents: the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) on the triennial review of the implementation of recommendations made by the Committee at its fifty-first session on the programme evaluation of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA); the annual overview report of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination for 2013; and the report of the Secretary-General on United Nations system support for the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). JOHANNES HUISMAN  Director  Programme Planning and Budget Division  Office of Programme Planning  Budget and Accounts  Department of Management  presented the proposed strategic framework for the period 2016-2017 (document A/69/6(Part One)  which would serve as the framework for the biennial programme budget proposals for 2016-2017.  Its two sections included: Part One: Plan Outline; Part Two: Biennial Programme Plans  which covered 28 programmes.  The Plan Outline concentrated on the eight areas of priority work  previously identified by the Assembly in resolution 65/262  and the Secretary-General’s vision for responding to those challenges. MARIO BAEZ  Chief of Policy and Oversight Coordination Service of the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Management  introduced the Secretary-General’s report on the programme performance of the United Nations for the biennium 2012-2013 (document A/69/144).  The report was prepared by the Department of Management  in accordance with an Assembly resolution that transferred that responsibility from the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS).  It contained information on the implementation of the Organization’s 33 696 outputs and provided an overview of the results for 876 expected accomplishments.  The overall output implementation rate in the Secretariat increased from 90 per cent during 2010-2011 to 91 per cent in 2012-2013  with only three budget sections below 80 per cent — disarmament at 79 per cent  public information at 77 per cent  and safety and security at 70 per cent. Ms. RIOS REQUNEA (Bolivia)  speaking for the Group of 77 and China  stressed the Committee for Programme and Coordination’s important work as the main subsidiary organ of the Assembly and the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) for planning  programming and coordination.  The Coordination Committee formed the core of the Assembly’s capacity to provide oversight in those key areas and the Group reaffirmed its commitment to strengthen that Committee’s work.  The Group welcomed the Coordination Committee’s guidance on developing the proposed strategic framework for the 2016-2017 biennium and re-emphasized that setting the Organization’s priorities remained the sole prerogative of Member States. She noted the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Small Island Developing States and the ongoing deliberations on the post-2015 development agenda.  The Group was committed to efforts to ensure the programme narratives of the proposed programme budget incorporated those new mandates.  Turning to the Chief Executive Board (CEB)  the Group urged the Secretary-General  in his capacity as Board Chairman  to keep taking steps to strengthen the Board’s transparency and accountability to Member States.  The Group also reaffirmed its position for continued cooperation among the CEB  the International Civil Service Commission and the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU). HIROSHI ONUMA (Japan) stressed the significant role of the Committee for Programme and Coordination in setting the United Nations regular budget.  The conflicting schedules  however  of the Coordination Committee and the second resumed session of the Fifth Committee had imposed a heavy burden on Member States and the Secretariat  as they were obliged to address those meetings simultaneously.  As a result  progress had been affected.  Going forward  schedule overlaps should be avoided or minimized.   Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-07,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gal3475.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Pointing to the rapid and destructive spread of terrorism and terrorist acts throughout the world  speaker after speaker urged the Sixth Committee (Legal) to overcome differences and find consensus on a draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism  as they began consideration of the matter. Miguel de Serpa Soares  Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs and United Nations Legal Counsel  emphasized that  in light of the “numerous shocking atrocities” currently taking place around the world  progress on the convention must be made  encouraging all delegations to take on the challenge. Trinidad and Tobago’s representative  speaking for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  supported his call  saying “the only beneficiaries of [the] protracted failure to adopt a comprehensive convention on terrorism have been the international criminals who continue to carry out their crimes with impunity.”  A convention would facilitate measures on the prosecution of terrorists and strengthen States’ — especially small States’ — capacity to confront terrorism.  However  States must resolve their differences and agree on a definition of terrorism. Echoing his counterpart  the representative of Pakistan also stressed that a comprehensive convention must clearly differentiate between acts of terrorism and legitimate struggles for self-determination of people living under foreign occupation.  He asked whether the United Nations should revamp its strategy  given that “the monster of terrorism seemed to be getting bigger” and was being used as an instrument for “asymmetric warfare”. Lebanon’s delegate pointed out that  despite the international community’s call that terrorism had no religious  ethnic or national identity  there were still too many people who continued to associate terrorism with Islam  which then fed “Islamophobia”.  He called for a culture of dialogue and tolerance among religions and civilizations  stressing the importance of preventing terrorism  particularly through education. Joining virtually every speaker  the delegate from the United States said that “all acts of aggression — by whomever committed — are criminal  inhumane and unjustifiable  regardless of motivation.”  Recognizing the significant accomplishments of the international community in developing a robust legal regime  she said that the 18 universal counterterrorism instruments were only effective if they were widely ratified and implemented. Nigeria’s delegate concurred  underscoring that terrorism had become a regular occurrence and constituted one of the deadliest threats to international peace and security.  Because it would take a network to defeat a network  there must be an all-inclusive regional and international approach for its defeat. At the onset of the meeting  Argentina’s delegate memorialized Alejandra Quezada of Chile  and a former member of the Sixth Committee  who had recently passed away.  Her many contributions to international and national law were acknowledged and a moment of silence was observed in her memory. Also speaking were representatives of Iran (on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement)  Australia  also for Canada and New Zealand  Egypt (on behalf of Organization of Islamic Cooperation)  Lao People’s Democratic Republic (on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations)  Russian Federation (also on behalf of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization)  European Union  Costa Rica (on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States)  Belarus  United Arab Emirates  Nicaragua  United Kingdom  Uruguay  Qatar  South Africa (on behalf of the African Group)  Democratic Republic of the Congo  Paraguay  Guatemala  Colombia  Sudan  Senegal  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Cambodia  Yemen  Kyrgyzstan  Malaysia  United Republic of Tanzania  Liechtenstein  Ukraine  Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  Serbia  Ecuador and the Republic of Korea. Speaking in exercise of the right of reply were representatives of Afghanistan  Israel and Ukraine. The Sixth Committee (Legal) will next meet at 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday  8 October  to continue its consideration of measures to eliminate international terrorism. Background The Committee had before it two documents relating to its programme of work  Organization of Work (document A/69/C.6/69/L.1) and Allocation of Agenda Items to the Sixth Committee (document A/69/C.6/69/1). The Committee was then set to consider the Secretary-General’s report on Measures to eliminate international terrorism (document A/69/209). Opening Remarks MIGUEL DE SERPA SOARES  Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs and United Nations Legal Counsel  reviewed “an impressive list of [the Sixth Committee’s] achievements”  covering a broad range of areas.  He stressed the three counter-terrorism Conventions recently negotiated by the Committee  further commending its role in the adoption of the Rome Statute. Noting that the Committee would create a working group toward finalizing a general convention on international terrorism  he emphasized the importance of making progress in light of the ”numerous shocking atrocities” currently taking place around the world.  He encouraged all delegations to take on the challenge. Organizational Matters The Committee  at its thirtieth meeting on 18 June of this year  had elected three Vice-Chairpersons:  Hossein Gharibi (Iran); Fernanda Millicay (Argentina) and Mirza Pasic (Bosnia and Herzegovina).  The Committee had also elected Salvatore Zappala (Italy) as its Rapporteur.  The Committee next took note of the 21 items allocated to it by the General Assembly on 19 September (see Press Release GA/11551). Two working groups were established for the following agenda items: “The scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction” and “Measures to eliminate international terrorism”.  With regard to the latter  it was decided that Amrith Rohan Perera (Sri Lanka)  who had chaired that working group since 2000  would continue to do so.  The Committee then approved its programme of work. Statements GHOLAM HOSSEIN DEHGHANI (Iran)  speaking for the Non-Aligned Movement  emphasized that terrorist acts constituted a flagrant violation of international law  including international humanitarian and human rights law.  However  terrorism should not be equated with the legitimate struggle of peoples under colonial or alien domination and foreign occupation  for self-determination and national liberation.  Further  terrorism should not be associated with any religion  nationality  civilization or ethnic group.  Those attributes must not be used to justify terrorism or counter-terrorist measures that included  inter alia  profiling of terror suspects and intrusion on individual privacy. He urged all States to fulfil their obligations under international law in combating terrorism.  However  States should not use force or the threat of force against any Non-Aligned Movement member under the pretext of countering terrorism or to pursue political aims.  Nor should the unilateral preparation of lists accusing States of allegedly supporting terrorism be used against a member.  States should refrain from extending any means of support for terrorism  ensuring that refugee and other legal statuses not be abused by terrorists. All States that had not yet done so should consider ratifying or acceding to the thirteen international instruments relating to combating terrorism  and implement their provisions and all relevant regional instruments  he said.  In addition  the Security Council sanction committees should streamline their listing and delisting procedures to address concerns of due process and transparency.  An International Summit Conference should formulate a joint response by the international community to terrorism in all its forms  including identifying the root causes and reaffirmed support for the United Nations Global Counterterrorism Strategy.  Condemning incidences of criminal hostage-taking with demands for ransom and/or other political concessions  he called on all States to cooperate to address the issue. JULIA O’BRIEN (Australia)  speaking also for Canada and New Zealand  said it had been 13 years since September 11  2001  yet international terrorism remained a serious threat to global peace and security.  Civilian populations continued to face well-armed and well-resourced terrorist organizations.  Those risks were compounded by rising numbers of foreign terrorist fighters and radicalized extremists.  As such  the world had a responsibility to prevent and respond to that threat consistently and in a coordinated manner based on common goals. She expressed continued support for the Ad Hoc Committee in elaborating a draft comprehensive convention.  Recognizing that differences remained between delegations  she expressed eagerness to discuss which mode of consideration was the most effective approach in taking the Committee’s work forward.  Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) provided a robust framework to prevent and suppress recruitment and organization of foreign terrorist fighters. She said more must be done to stop paying ransom  as it undermined the international community’s hard work to degrade terrorist organizations.  Such efforts were critical to preventing terrorist access to financial resources.  However  effectiveness of those measures depended on the capacity of Member States to implement them.  She underscored a continued commitment to take decisive action to address the scourge of terrorism and to work with other delegations to eliminate the threat of terrorism once and for all. AMR EL-HAMAMY (Egypt)  speaking for the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)  denounced atrocities committed by terrorists around the world and stressed that they contradicted the practices and principles of Islam.  No religion or religious doctrine encouraged or inspired acts of terrorism  and therefore  none should be portrayed as such.  He strongly condemned some politicians’ attempts to link Islam with terrorism  noting that such attempts played in the hands of terrorists and constituted an advocacy of religious hatred  discrimination and hostility against Muslims. Reaffirming the OIC’s commitment to strengthening mutual cooperation  he said that only a coordinated approach by the international community would yield effective results.  Further  a comprehensive strategy must address the root causes of terrorism  such as the unlawful use of force  aggression and political and economic injustice  among others. He reiterated the need to distinguish between terrorism and the exercise of the legitimate right of peoples to resist foreign occupation  noting that such distinction was duly observed in international law and international humanitarian law.  He also called for cooperation in banning the payment of ransoms to terrorist groups.  Underscoring the need to make progress on the draft comprehensive convention  he emphasized his determination to resolve outstanding issues  including those related to the legal definition of terrorism and voiced support for the convening of a high-level conference under the auspices of the United Nations. KHAINE PHAN SOURIVONG (Lao People's Democratic Republic)  speaking for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  emphasized that terrorism undermined international peace and security and hindered development efforts.  He delineated ASEAN’s collective efforts at the regional and international levels to fight international terrorism  which were in line with the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and all relevant United Nations conventions and resolutions  noting that ASEAN’s primary framework for cooperation was its Convention on Counter-Terrorism. He went on to underscore that human rights and the provision of fundamental freedoms must be ensured while fighting terrorism.  The main principles of international law  especially international humanitarian and human rights law  should be respected.  He called on Member States to implement the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  including the Organization’s relevant conventions and resolutions  and to address outstanding issues in order to produce a draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism. EVGENY ZAGAYNOV (Russian Federation)  speaking for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization  expressed grave concern over the expansion of terrorist ideology.  The condemnation of terrorism must be an intrinsic part of the dialogue between religions and civilizations.  Also important in the fight against terrorism were partnerships between States  civil society  mass media and the private sector. During the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s Summit  recently held in Dushanbe  its leaders had reaffirmed their determination to strengthen the coordination of joint efforts in the fight against terrorism  extremism  drug trafficking and organized crime  he said.  The Organization would also continue to improve the functioning of its specialized entity  the Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure  which coordinated work between the authorities of its member States and maintained the necessary information exchange.  In that regard  he proposed increased interaction between the Structure and corresponding United Nations agencies. Regional security was a top priority in Central Asia  where terrorist and narcotic threats from Afghanistan were major destabilizing factors  he went on to say.  A dangerous nexus between terrorism and organized crime  especially drug-related crime  formed in that region.  Noting the withdrawal of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) from Afghanistan by the end of this year  he called for the implementation of United Nations decisions and partnership among States and organizations in the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking. EGLANTINE CUJO  European Union Delegation  said that the current uprising of the “Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS)” posed a threat to peace and security beyond Syria  Iraq and the Middle East.  Condemning the indiscriminate killings and human rights abuses perpetrated by terrorist organizations  she said that the international community must respond jointly and redouble efforts to work within the framework of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.  Member States must ensure that measures taken complied with international law  human rights law  refugee law and humanitarian law.  Member States and relevant United Nations entities should also promote measures ensuring solidarity and assistance to victims  such as the recently launched Web Portal for Victims. Noting the need to prevent radicalization and recruitment to terrorism  she said the Union had revised its strategy to prevent radicalization through establishment of a “Knowledge Hub” to collate and disseminate best practices.  The Union was also committed to tackle the threat of foreign terrorist fighters with a comprehensive  strategic approach.  Because countering financing was key to combating terrorism  the Union was cooperating with the private sector  sharing financial intelligence and information.  Measures had also been adopted to facilitate implementation of Security Council resolution 2133 (2014) on preventing ransoms to terrorists. Listing the numerous United Nations entities with which the Union cooperated  she expressed hope for continued transparent and cooperative work  while avoiding duplication of efforts.  Due process and fair and clear procedures in sanctions regimes should be strengthened.  She detailed cooperative strategies at the regional level in the Horn of Africa  Yemen and Pakistan  and recognized the potential of religious and traditional leaders in combatting radicalization  violent extremism and terrorism at early stages.  She called for all Member States to ratify and implement all United Nations legal instruments relating to counter-terrorism and expressed commitment to successfully concluding a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. GEORGINA GUILLÉN-GRILLO (Costa Rica)  speaking for the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  expressed support for the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and said the Community had actively participated in the Fourth Review of the Strategy  which took place in June this year.  Deeply concerned with the increasing flow of international recruits to terrorist organizations  including foreign terrorist fighters  she encouraged all Member States to address the threat through enhanced cooperation and development of relevant measures. The protection of the right to privacy was crucial in safeguarding individuals against an abuse of power  she said.  As such  she was deeply concerned about the negative impact that State surveillance and/or interception of communications  including extraterritorially  might have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights.  She also reiterated rejection of the unilateral elaboration of blacklists  accusing States of allegedly supporting and sponsoring terrorism  noting the practice’s inconsistency with international law. She said the Community recognized steps taken by the Security Council 1267/1989 Sanctions Committee towards more clear procedures and  in that regard  strongly supported the role of the Ombudsperson  which had significantly improved the fairness and transparency of the delisting process.  The position of Ombudsperson must be made permanent and due process further enhanced in the Security Council sanctions regimes.  She called upon all Member States to continue negotiations and efforts to achieve a comprehensive convention on terrorism  voicing hope that substantial results could lead to a high-level conference on terrorism. LIZANNE ACHING (Trinidad and Tobago)  speaking for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  and associating herself with CELAC and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that terrorism had implications for the survival of nations  good governance and the sustainable development of all Member States.  The elimination of international terrorism was a key priority on the regional security agenda.  CARICOM was committed to addressing conditions conducive to its spread  building State capacity to prevent and combat terrorism and ensuring respect for human rights and the rule of law as fundamental bases in the fight.  Several CARICOM member States had enacted and implemented legislation to prevent and counter acts of international terrorism. She called for greater support from the United Nations system to supplement those efforts through the provision of technical and other forms of assistance to the region.  The global strategy against terrorism must include the finalization of negotiations on the draft comprehensive convention.  States must resolve their differences and agree on the definition of terrorism.  “The only beneficiaries of [the] protracted failure to adopt a comprehensive convention on terrorism have been the international criminals who continue to carry out their crimes with impunity ” she said.  The convention would  among other things  facilitate measures on the prosecution of terrorists and strengthen States’ — especially small States’ — capacity to confront terrorism. DMITRY SPRESOV (Belarus)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  confirmed his country’s commitment to a comprehensive and depoliticized cooperation in the implementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  international treaties to combat terrorism and corresponding resolutions of the Security Council.  Citing new trends in terrorism  such as the use of unmanned aerial vehicles  new information and communication technologies  foreign fighters and the question of personal inviolability in combating terrorism  he said the work of the Committee and its special working group on the subject would be vital to a reasoned discussion. His country’s efforts to combat terrorism had received high marks during the country visit of the Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee  he said.  Unfortunately  however  every day was a confirmation that there were no countries or regions that were immune to terrorist threats.  The lack of progress on the draft comprehensive convention was alarming.  Stressing that trends in terrorism required a quick response  he called on all interested parties to exercise flexibility in talks and actions in order to confirm their commitment in the fight against the scourge. GORDON BRISTOL (Nigeria) said that terrorism had become a regular occurrence  which constituted one of the deadliest threats to international peace and security.  Because it would take a network to defeat a network  there must be an all-inclusive regional and international approach for its defeat. In that regard  he expressed support for the establishment of a working group to finalize a comprehensive draft convention on the matter. A recent upsurge of terrorist acts by Boko Haram in his country had led to the development of new national plans and greater cooperation with neighbours and internationally  he said.  Recently  a plan of action that addressed the “terrorist cycle  from radicalization to rehabilitation” had been established  and included de-radicalizing convicted terrorists and suspects awaiting trial; galvanizing society against terrorism through family  cultural and religious systems; building capacity to articulate national values coherently and recognizing the causes of terrorism.  Furthermore  the increase in cyber threats capable of causing mass disruption imperilled global commerce and communications.  An equally interconnected response was needed from the international community.  In order to resolve the war against terrorism all States must ensure full compliance with all relevant conventions and resolutions. ZUHOOR AL MEQBAALI (United Arab Emirates)  associating herself with the OIC and Non-Aligned Movement  said that while serious forms of international terrorism could be seen today in the Middle East  North Africa and Sahel countries  terrorist activity was not limited to those regions.  International terrorism was spreading to all countries around the world and all countries were a source of growing armies of mercenaries and foreign fighters. She said her country had enacted legislation to combat terrorism and had signed 13 international conventions on counter-terrorism  which had helped strengthen its monitoring mechanism and stop the use of its territory  air space and waters as a basis for committing terrorist acts.  Legislation had also been adopted dealing with sanctions on those found to have committed terrorist acts.  A study was being conducted that investigated blocking the network of terrorists using media to recruit people.  Policies were in place to fight money laundering and illegal commerce.  An international conference should be convened to help clearly define terrorism. JAIME HERMIDA CASTILLO (Nicaragua)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and CELAC  condemned all forms of terrorism  including State terrorism  from which his country had suffered.  Expressing solidarity with the people of Palestine  he said the Security Council must ensure that Israel cease its occupation.  He also voiced solidarity with the Government and people of Syria  stating that foreign intervention must be stopped.  It was regrettable that  rather than engaging in dialogue  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries were taking unilateral actions  including bombing sovereign countries in the name of peace.  He also rejected unilateral sanctions  which  he said  violated international law. The United Nations must be the principle organization to guarantee world peace  he said.  Demanding the immediate release of Cuban anti-terrorist patriots from a United States prison  he condemned the unilateral listing of States supporting terrorism  stating that Cuba should be struck from such lists.  The double standard could not continue to be normal diplomacy in combatting terrorism.  That fight must be coordinated within international law.  A comprehensive convention to combat terrorism that recorded all its forms should be established. JONATHAN DOWDALL (United Kingdom)  associating himself with the European Union  noted the alarming increase in threat from ISIL  with the impact most severe in Iraq and Syria where people had witnessed numerous atrocities.  The brutal murder of two American journalists and two British aid workers  almost certainly by a foreign terrorist fighter from the United Kingdom  was stark evidence that ISIL and organizations such as the al-Nusra Front were recruiting new fighters from all over the world.  The international community must focus strongly on tackling the “poisonous” ideologies of violent extremism.  For that reason  his Government had called for a United Nations Special Representative on extremism. He said ISIL was sitting on extensive assets  yet also relied heavily on income generation.  The international community must work to disrupt that income where possible  including suppressing the market for stolen oil  tackling the illicit trade in antiquities  and sanctioning those who trade with such groups and raise funds for them.  The vicious cycle caused by paying ransom from kidnappings must also be broken.  The unprecedented number of individuals traveling to conflict zones  such as Syria  to fight with terrorist groups  also needed to be disrupted.  Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) was particularly pertinent in that regard. GONZALO KONCKE (Uruguay)  associating himself with CELAC  spoke of two visits from the Counter-Terrorism Committee to his country  the first in 2012  which resulted in a report indicating that the country was on the right path in its counter-terrorism efforts and made several recommendations.  A follow-up visit by the Committee also offered support  which would be of benefit domestically and to the international community.  Turning to money-laundering  he pointed out that  according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)  funds from organized crime supported terrorism by some $2 trillion dollars annually.  He expressed concern at the recruitment of foreign fighters and the use of media to display executions and expressed hope that those issues would be addressed.  The need to find a definition of terrorism was “no small work”  he said  but expressed optimism that a consensus would be reached. ALYA AHMED SAIF AL-THANI (Qatar)  noting that greater cooperation was critical to expedite the conclusion of an international convention  reiterated that the document should include a specific definition of terrorism that distinguished between terrorism and the legitimate right of peoples to self-determination.  She also expressed support for an international conference on the subject. Totalitarian and oppressive dictatorships against people who aspired to social justice had contributed to circumstances leading to the growth of terrorism  she said.  The linking of religion to terrorism also fostered the growth of extremist organizations and helped brainwash recruits.  Her country  in cooperation with the Global Counter Terrorism Forum  had hosted a workshop in March of this year on countering violent extremism and had provided $5 million for the establishment of a global forum fund.   At the national level  it had approved new legislation including banning the use of electronic tools for terrorist purposes. THEMBILE ELPHUS JOYINI (South Africa)  speaking for the African Group  said all nations had an interest in being more proactive and adopting a preventive approach in combating terrorism.  Stressing the importance of concluding a comprehensive convention for combating international terrorism  he called upon States to resolve the outstanding issues.  Serious consideration should be given to convening a high-level conference to formulate an international response to terrorism. He expressed concern at the increase in kidnappings and hostage-taking aimed at raising funds or gaining political concessions.  The payment of ransoms to terrorist groups was one of their main sources of financing.  Member States should work together to address the issue.  Welcoming initiatives for cooperation between the Organization and regional groups  he said such efforts were important to strengthen the capacity of African countries towards adoption of coordinated approaches to counter-terrorism.  Effective implementation of relevant conventions and related United Nations resolutions  as well as capacity-building in developing countries  were vital to a well-functioning universal international law approach. ZÉNON MUKONGO NGAY (Democratic Republic of the Congo)  associating himself with the African Group and Non-Aligned Movement  said that the idea of peace through law was in opposition to terrorism  and the combining of domestic law of States and international instruments listed in the Secretary-General’s report should become a reality.  The jurisdiction of State courts and tribunals should be established to prosecute those alleged of committing terrorist acts with guarantee of due process.  His country had participated in regional and sub-regional counter-terrorism activities  such as in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and the Southern African Development Community  and would also participate in a workshop to combat terrorism regionally.  Noting that a comprehensive convention would complement the content of existing sectorial tools to strengthen the legal counter-terrorism framework  he called on other delegations to conclude the debate on that question. JOSÉ ANTONIO DOS SANTOS (Paraguay)  associating himself with CELAC  said his country was implementing the Global Strategy based on its four pillars.  In recent years  his country had ratified 13 international instruments combating terrorism as well as a number of regional instruments.  Furthermore  the Financial Action Task Force had recognized the work of his Government in fighting funding for terrorism.  Giving a detailed overview of his country’s national initiatives  he underscored that the fight against terrorism must respect international law and human rights  which was essential to eradicating the scourge. CRISTINA RODRÍGUEZ PINEDA (Guatemala)  associating her delegation with CELAC and the Non-Aligned Movement  said that the United Nations must act as a leader in coordinating efforts against terrorism and all countries must demonstrate a concerted response.  Only with effective cooperation would the international community be able to have an effective and sustainable response to terrorism on a global level.  Emphasizing the importance of regional and sub-regional components  she said the Organization of American States had acquired valuable experience in counter-terrorism within the inter-American system.  The efficiency of efforts was related to their ability to successfully face conditions which fuelled that phenomenon.  Nonetheless  it was critical to adopt a comprehensive convention as soon as possible.  The Sixth Committee was essential in that endeavour.  She expressed concerns with respect to the Security Council’s decisions on ransom payment to terrorist groups  stressing that the subject was not yet governed by international law and also represented terminology and legal concepts that were diverse. EMMA MEJÍA VÉLEZ (Colombia)  associating herself with CELAC  said that the Global Strategy’s four pillars were of equal importance and should be implemented in a balanced manner.  The payment of ransom as a funding source was of great concern.  It must be made clear that victims of kidnapping were at risk of losing their lives and  at least temporarily  their freedom.  Those trying to aid the victims should not be made criminals for doing so.  In addition  the increased number of foreign fighters greatly affected the stability of certain regions in the world.  The radicalization that led to violent extremism must be addressed.  However  all measures must be in line with all aspects of international law and must respect human rights.  Stereotyping and restrictions on travellers must be avoided.  The international community must also adopt measures to address money laundering  as well as the illicit transfer of arms.  The fight against terrorism would fail without a comprehensive convention.  It was time to make final decisions on the matter  however difficult that might be.  The convention would strengthen existing legal instruments.  Defining terrorism in the multilateral forum would demonstrate the Organization’s commitment. IDREES MOHAMMED ALI MOHAMMED SAEED (Sudan)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement  the OIC and the African Group  said his country had ratified numerous international conventions  as well as regional ones on counter-terrorism  and had participated in OIC efforts  as well.  At the national level  the Government had adopted and implemented a national strategy following consultations with civil society.  A law against money laundering and terrorism financing had been modified  providing a framework for protecting the national economy and combating corruption.  A new law had also been adopted to combat human trafficking  and workshops and conferences had been held towards strengthening international cooperation in that regard.  Initiatives on raising awareness about counterterrorism activities were being implemented with religious authorities  women and youth.  The media was also being used to combat terrorism  appeal to moderation  and combat cybercrime.  With Saudi Arabia’s support  Sudan had participated in Riyadh in the initiative to combat terrorism.  Stressing that combating poverty and strengthening dialogue between north and south countries  among other things  were critical to a peaceful existence  he “refused” unilateral measures which would accuse some countries of supporting terrorism to attain political ends.  Terrorism must be fought with cooperation. FODE SECK (Senegal)  associating himself with the OIC  the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement said that combating terrorism required coordinated efforts under the aegis of the United Nations.  Initiatives promoting dialogue among different civilizations  cultures and religions were needed.  His country’s national approach included prevention  aimed at stemming terrorists’ means and ability to cause harm  as well as legislation and strategic communication with religious leaders.  Senegal had also ratified 13 of the 19 international instruments relating to terrorism  among other actions.  Another national initiative was his Government’s quick response to punish perpetrators and assure the protection of populations and assistance to victims.  In that context  he welcomed the Victims of Terrorism Web Portal.  He expressed concern at the rise in foreign fighters  coming from more than 80 countries  and welcomed the initiative to better understand terrorism in order to address it.  He also appealed to the international community to support efforts by the countries of Sahel and West Africa. MIRZA PASIC (Bosnia and Herzegovina)  aligning himself with the European Union  said his country had harmonised its legislation with United Nations and European Union standards  and had adopted a national strategy for combating terrorism.  In June of this year  it had amended its criminal code to prohibit participation of its citizens on foreign battlefields and to allow prosecution of those who joined terrorist activities  encouraged them or supported their financing.  Recalling Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) on the threat of foreign terrorist fighters  he said his country had continued to reaffirm its commitment to fight and prevent terrorism by co-sponsoring that resolution.  It had also signed and ratified all relevant United Nations conventions and protocols on the fight against terrorism.  He expressed support for the establishment of a working group on international terrorism at its current session and advocated completion and adoption of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.  MASOOD KHAN (Pakistan)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and OIC  asked whether the United Nations should revamp its strategy  given that “the monster of terrorism seemed to be getting bigger” and was being used as an instrument for asymmetric warfare.  Noting that his country was engaged in an “unrelenting war” against terrorism on its own soil that had cost 50 000 lives and financial losses exceeding $100 billion  he spoke of his country’s multi-pronged strategy  through military actions  but also through education  assuring that counter-terrorism measures conformed to international obligations and through legislation. “A dialogue among civilizations is an absolute imperative to prevent divergences in attitudes and thoughts from becoming fodder for […] terrorist ideologies ” he said  stressing that the Counter-Terrorism Strategy should address the defamation of certain religions and the demonization of their communities that acted as incitement to hatred.  He also demanded the cessation of drone strikes in Pakistan’s border areas  which violated sovereignty and the principles of international and humanitarian law.  The comprehensive convention on terrorism must clearly differentiate between acts of terrorism and legitimate struggles for self-determination of people living under foreign occupation. Mr. HITT (Lebanon)  associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and OIC  said the Committee’s discussion must focus on the most effective way to bolster collective action and efforts to eradicate  once and for all  a scourge that had been plaguing societies for too long.  The adoption of Security Council resolution 2170 (2014) and resolution 2178 (2014) served as a strong signal of the international community’s determination to eliminate that threat.  Stressing the importance of prevention  particularly through education  and the promotion of a culture of dialogue and tolerance among religions and civilizations  he said the latter aspect needed greater emphasis given the current situation in the Middle East.  Despite the international community’s call that terrorism had no religious  ethnic or national identity  there were still too many people who continued to associate terrorism with Islam  which then fed “Islamophobia”.  Root causes  such as poverty  social exclusion and impunity that might lead to violent extremism and radicalism must also be addressed.  Terrorist groups exploit those weaknesses and flaws to fuel their hate speech and spread their ideology. RY TUY (Cambodia)  associating himself with ASEAN  said to date his country had ratified all important United Nations conventions and protocols  as well as the ASEAN Convention on Counter-Terrorism.  In addition  it had enacted important laws and regulations  such as the Criminal Code and the Law on Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing.  His Government was in the process of setting forth the “Safe Village  Safe Commune Policy”  incorporating the participation of villagers and civil society organizations  including political parties  to ensure safety and security in villages and communes throughout the country.  Noting that Cambodia had focused on inter-agency cooperation at the national level  he hoped to share best practices with other States for the successful prevention and suppression of international terrorism.  AHMED AL-OJARI (Yemen)  associating himself with the OIC and the Non-Aligned Movement  said it was necessary to complete a comprehensive convention  which included a clear definition that distinguished between terrorism and legitimate resistance against occupation.  His country had co-sponsored Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) and adopted in 2012 a strategic matrix to counter-terrorism  dry up terrorist resources and financing and raise awareness of the threat and dangers posed by terrorism and extremism.  It had also issued legislation to counter money laundering and financing of terrorism and had criminalized  in particular  participation in terrorist activities  including incitement.  Despite his country’s suffering from the scourge of terrorism  its efforts to counter terrorism  in particular  Al Qaeda  were continuing and gaining pace.  Yemen’s armed forces had been able to deal lethal strikes against Al Qaeda and had gained control over many of the areas that were controlled by terrorists.  It had also destroyed safe havens used for planning and training.  Al Qaeda was now weaker than before  despite his country’s limited resources.  He called on international and regional partners to provide logistical and technical assistance and expand frameworks of coordination and information exchange in the fight against terrorism. NURAN NIYAZALIEV (Kyrgyzstan)  associating himself with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization  reiterated support for all measures adopted within the United Nations framework on combating international terrorism.  His country had joined most of the Organization’s existing conventions  and was taking steps to implement Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) on addressing the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters.  Voicing support for the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  he called for a High-level conference to formulate a joint organized response to terrorism and elaborate its common definition.  It was not possible to overcome terrorism by force  which generated negative results.  Kyrgyzstan was using “soft power” to counter the causes of terrorism  such as improving the social and economic situation  reducing poverty  creating jobs  fighting corruption and reforming the legal and judicial systems.  He further underlined the difficulties that a lack of expertise and resources presented for many countries  particularly in implementing the recent Security Council resolution. HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia)  associating his delegation with the Non-Aligned Movement  OIC and ASEAN  called for the early conclusion of a comprehensive convention on terrorism  adding that such a convention would complement other existing international conventions.  Resistance to foreign aggression and the struggle of peoples under foreign occupation was legitimate and terrorist acts perpetrated by States and non-State actors should be treated alike.  It was essential to share ideas and expertise in de-radicalization and counter-radicalization programmes.  Member States must keep pace with the latest tactics of terrorist operations  in particular  the increased use of the internet to disseminate their propaganda.  His country had recently amended its anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing act to enhance the investigative powers of law enforcement agencies and had signed and ratified ASEAN’s Convention on Counter-Terrorism. TULLY M. MWAIPOPO (United Republic of Tanzania)  associating herself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group  said that her country was party to nine universal counter-terrorism instruments and one regional instrument.  It had also undertaken administrative and legislative steps  including the enactment of relevant laws and the establishment of inter-agency entities that coordinated the Government’s counter-terrorism efforts.  Nonetheless  her country continued to face several challenges.  Small arms  light weapons and their ammunitions remained the most commonly used means of terrorist attacks.  Conflicts and instability  especially in the Great Lakes region and Somalia  had given rise to illicit circulation of small arms and light weapons that abetted terrorist acts.  Furthermore  the porous borders in the region had been a precursor for terrorists to move in and out unchecked.  Poor border security had led to the spread of transnational crimes such as human trafficking  drug trafficking  fire arms smuggling and money laundering.  Given the complex nature of terrorism  she called for an integrated and coordinated response by the international community. STEFAN BARRIGA (Liechtenstein) said that while he hoped that the Security Council resolution on foreign terrorist fighters would be fully implemented  he had hoped for a more detailed emphasis on the need to respect fundamental human rights  and  in particular  due process rights.  There was a real risk that measures could be interpreted too broadly or used as a pretext for repressive action.  Noting that many of the international conventions dealing with terrorist crimes required the State of nationality to establish jurisdiction over terrorist offenses committed by their nationals abroad  he said now would be a good time to take stock of the actual impact of those conventions and the extent of their practical application.  Recent events should motivate the Committee to conclude its work on a draft counter-terrorism convention  which would fill the gaps between the various “sectoral” conventions.  Reiterating his country’s proposal to better align the Committee’s work with the Plenary’s consideration of the Counter-Terrorism strategy  he stressed that there was no need to have a general debate on the issue twice within a few months.  The Plenary’s biennial consideration should replace the Sixth Committee debate and resolution on essentially the same topic. OLEKSANDR PAVLICHENKO (Ukraine)  aligning his delegation with the European Union  called upon all Member States that had not done so to join all international instruments on the matter  noting that his country was party to over 20 such instruments.  Nuclear terrorism was one of terrorism’s most dangerous forms.  Despite the foreign aggression his country was experiencing  Ukraine was committed to eliminating all of its nuclear materials.  His Government had been conducting counter-terrorism activities in the east of the country since March.  The situation demonstrated that the international community must redouble its efforts. To that end  he called on all States to finalize work on the draft convention  suggesting that the 2007 proposals might serve as a good basis.  On the domestic front  he said that a neighbour was violating international laws on terrorism and was supporting terrorist activities in his country.  The Declaration of the International Conference on Terrorism of 1987 could be taken as the basis for a new  legally binding instrument in the field.  He urged the Russian Federation to cease all actions that might constitute a crime and expressed hope that there would be sincere dialogue between the countries in the near future. KIM YONG SONG (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea)  associating his delegation with the Non-Aligned Movement  said the United Nations must double its efforts to put an end to terrorism  while ensuring those efforts be conducted in accordance with the Charter and international law  stipulating respect for sovereign equality and non-interference.  Armed invasions and interference in other States’ internal affairs committed under the pretext of fighting terrorism were bound to trigger retaliation and massive bloodshed.  In addition  States’ categorizing other States as sponsors of terrorism and imposing sanctions on them only served to create obstacles in international efforts to combat terrorism.  Because such State terrorism could not be justified in any cases  the comprehensive convention must cover the issue of eradication.  Also  the text should prioritize the removal of terrorism’s root causes  such as domination and interference  poverty and social inequalities  and racial or religious discrimination  among others.  Only when root causes were eliminated could counter-terrorism efforts yield expected results.  He expressed support for a high-level meeting on terrorism  noting that for its part  his country had signed key international conventions and was amending or supplementing relevant laws to ban financial support to terrorism.  BORIS HOLOVKA (Serbia)  aligning his delegation with the European Union  said that in suppressing terrorism  all elements that contributed to its spread must be considered  as must its financing.  The sudden rise in numbers of foreign terrorist fighters coincided with the development of communication technology and social networks.  Force alone was not sufficient to meet that challenge.  Banning recruitment and transport of potential foreign terrorist fighters through appropriate national legislation and engaging local communities in suppressing violent extremism would be a first step.  In that regard  he saw the adoption of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) as significant.  Draft amendments were pending in his country’s Parliament on the matter.  Noting that the Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee had appraised Serbia as one of the countries with the most significant counter-terrorist capacities  he said the country stood ready to offer expertise to others in the region. EVGENY ZAGAYNOV (Russian Federation) called for a “stepping-up” of international cooperation to prevent terrorism  including the halting of the illegal oil trade and prohibiting of the spread of weapons from Libya.  It was also important to reduce the attractiveness of terrorism and eliminate terror’s use of the media and internet.  Broad dialogue could make positive contributions in education and research  and promote tolerance and mutual understanding.  While the primary responsibility for carrying out the Counter-Terrorism Strategy lied with Member States  the United Nations must focus on strengthening the legal basis for counter-terrorism.  Agreement upon a universal convention would be a leap forward in that regard. The Ukrainian representative’s allegations against his country were absolutely inadmissible and demonstrated a lack of understanding of the essence of terrorism  he went on to say.  Kyiv had continued terrorist activities and had carried out a punitive operation using a broad arsenal of military means on civilians.  Instead of dialogue  Kyiv had ignored norms of international law as well as moral ideas by bombing cities and infrastructure  he said  stressing that the number of victims from such criminal acts counted in the hundreds. PATRICIO TROYA (Ecuador)  associating his delegation with the Non-Aligned Movement and CELAC  said that the fight against terrorism must be conducted within international law  including humanitarian law and with respect for national sovereignty.  Unilateral measures were useless and only worsened the situation.  The only military actions that had any legitimacy were those taken through the Security Council.  The Global Strategy was the best route to combat terrorism.  Attaching importance to regional organizations  he said that knowledge of local cultures was of great importance to combatting terrorism.  He also rejected lists  compiled unilaterally  of countries supporting terrorism and the inclusion of Cuba on such lists.  Supporting the implementation of open consultations on the convention on international terrorism that would consider all points of view  he voiced support for convening a high-level meeting on the topic. LEE MOON-HEE (Republic of Korea) said  as host of the Seoul Conference on Cyberspace in 2013  his country had strived to raise awareness on the importance of promoting international cooperation to reduce emerging threats stemming from the malicious use of information and communication technology.  That heightened awareness had become more relevant given terrorists’ use of those technologies to spread their ideology  expand their networks and develop more sophisticated financing methods.  Stressing the persistence and severity of terrorist attacks  which violated and destroyed humanity  he said it was time for States to reaffirm their political will  redouble their efforts and exercise flexibility in order to bring negotiations on a comprehensive convention to a close. CAROL HAMILTON (United States) said that “all acts of terrorism – committed by whomever– are criminal  inhumane and unjustifiable  regardless of motivation.”  To succeed in preventing such heinous acts  an unwavering and united effort by the international community was critical.  Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) obligated States to criminalize certain activities related to the threat of foreign terrorist fighters.  It would be fruitful to exchange views with colleagues on implementation of the resolution  as well as enable those States that so wished to obtain technical assistance.   While the international community’s accomplishments in developing a robust legal counterterrorism regime were significant  much work remained to be done  she said  stressing that the 18 universal counterterrorism instruments were only effective if they were widely ratified and implemented.  Her delegation was working closely with the United States Congress to pass legislation that would allow the country to ratify the Nuclear Terrorism Convention  the 2005 Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material  and the 2005 Protocols to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation. Right of Reply In exercise of the right of reply  a representative of Afghanistan  referring to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation statement that was delivered by the Russian Federation  said that his country was an observer State to the Organisation and was committed to cooperation in the fight against narcotics and terrorism.  While his country was a victim of terrorism  terrorism was an international issue.  Thus  the statement delivered by the Russian Federation that the terrorism and narcotics threat emanated from Afghanistan did not reflect the realities of the region and contradicted the spirit of regional cooperation essential to counter terrorism.  In exercise of the right of reply  a representative of Israel said that it was beyond absurd for his country to be lectured by Lebanon’s representative and that perhaps that country should tone down its rhetoric and turn up the heat on Hezbollah.  It was time for the Lebanese Government to take responsibility for what happened on its soil.  That country’s recurring acts of aggression violated United Nations resolutions and destabilized an already shaky region. Ukraine’s representative  in exercise of the right of reply  said it was unfortunate that the Russian Federation continued to deny its role in the situation in Ukraine.  It was the Russian Federation who continued to supply terrorist organizations in Ukraine with the newest weaponry and arms  train fighters sent to Ukraine to fight Ukrainian troops  and it was Russian militants who continued to kill and torture civilians in the east of Ukraine.  Those facts had been confirmed by international human rights organizations.  Also  it was the Russian Federation who occupied Crimea and that fact had never been accepted by this Organization.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-07,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gashc4097.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Concern about the worldwide state of social and humanitarian affairs called for collective actions rooted in solidarity and inclusion  the Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) heard today as it began its discussions on social development. “People — their social progress and the realization of their social rights — must be at the centre of development ” said Thomas Gass  Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs  delivering remarks on behalf of Wu Hongbo  Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs.  Welcoming the progress made and lessons learned since the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals  he emphasized that the new development agenda would be built upon those lessons. Echoing that sentiment  the representative of Costa Rica  speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  said his region had worked towards a people-centred agenda.  Eradicating hunger and poverty was an ethical  political  social and economic challenge  he said  urging that measures were needed to promote inclusive development strategies that fostered a more equitable distribution of economic benefits and improved access to basic services  he added.  A number of speakers voiced their concerns about older persons  with the representative of the European Union calling on Governments to take active steps in addressing age discrimination  decent work and social protection for the elderly  including access to adequate pensions  health services  long-term care and protection from elder abuse.  In the same vein  the representative of the United States noted that elder abuse was an underestimated problem to which effective responses needed to be developed. Several reports of the Secretary-General addressing a range of issues were introduced by Jean-Pierre Gonnot  Chief  Social Integration Branch  Department of Economic and Social Affairs  who delivered a statement on behalf of Branch Director Daniela Bas.  A report promoting a disability-inclusive development agenda included measurable targets and indicators in post-2015 development frameworks. Several delegates voiced their support for a more disability-inclusive development agenda.  The representative of Malaysia  speaking on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  said technical cooperation among its Member States was critical.  Some speakers provided overviews of national achievements and mechanisms that had been put in place to develop services tailored for persons with disabilities.  The representative of the Russian Federation also mentioned his country’s accessible environment programme aimed at providing unimpeded and free access for all individuals with disabilities.  A number of youth delegates addressed the Committee  raising concerns about young people in their countries.  Australia’s youth delegate informed the Committee that mental health had been raised as a key issue  with suicide being the leading cause of death for people aged 16 to 24 years.  Globally  States must better integrate mental health into holistic health responses  she emphasized.  Speaking during today’s meeting were representatives of Bolivia (on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China)  Malawi (on behalf of the African Group)  Bahamas (on behalf of the Caribbean Community)  Botswana (on behalf of the Southern African Development Community)  Italy  Cuba  India  Japan  Switzerland  Israel  Mexico  Thailand  Brazil  Singapore  Philippines  Syria  Iran  Sweden  Senegal  Slovenia  Netherlands  Nicaragua  Colombia  Poland  Kazakhstan  Ethiopia  South Africa  Libya and Qatar. Also addressing the Committee today was Venkata Subbarao Ilapavuluri of the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Liaison Office in New York. The Third Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. Wednesday  8 October  to continue its debate on social development. Background The Third Committee (Social  Humanitarian and Cultural) met this morning to adopt its work programme for the current session and begin its discussion on social development.  Before members was the first report of the General Committee on “Organization of the sixty-eighth regular session of the General Assembly  adoption of the agenda and allocation of items” (document A/69/250). Also before the Committee were reports of the Secretary-General on: “Implementation of the outcome of the World Summit for Social Development and of the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly” (document A/69/157); “Preparations for and observance of the twentieth anniversary of the International Year of the Family in 2014” (document A/69/61-E/2014/4); “Realization of the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals for persons with disabilities: a disability-inclusive development agenda towards 2015 and beyond” (document A/69/187); and “Follow-up to the International Year of Older Persons: Second World Assembly on Ageing” (document A/69/180). The Committee also had before it a note by the Secretary-General transmitting the Report of the Director-General of the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization on literacy for life: shaping future agendas” (document A/69/183). Introduction of Reports JEAN-PIERRE GONNOT  Chief  Social Integration Branch  Department of Economic and Social Affairs  speaking on behalf of Daniela Bas  Director  Division for Social Policy and Development  introduced four reports on social development.  The first of those reports  on the outcome of the World Summit for Social Development  highlighted the important role played by Governments in creating an enabling environment by adopting an empowering approach to policymaking and implementation.  Empowerment could accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and support a post-2015 development agenda.  Moving to the report on the Year of the Family  he emphasized that making families the focus of social development efforts was a way to tackle persistent development challenges such as intergenerational transfer of poverty and inequality.  The report concluded that adding a family perspective to the post-2015 development agenda would contribute to empowerment and inequality reduction. Introducing the report on persons with disabilities  he underscored the options contained within it to promote a disability-inclusive development agenda.  That included measurable targets and indicators for disability in post-2015 development frameworks.  Furthermore  a coordination mechanism within the United Nations system to address gaps and needs for technical assistance had been proposed.  Concluding with the report on Follow-up to the International Year of Older Persons  he mentioned the heightened discussions and recognition of neglect  abuse and violence against the elderly  in particular women  yet providing recent developmental and rights-based regional policy developments and publications. VENKATA SUBBARAO ILAPAVULURI  United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  introduced the report entitled “Literacy for life: shaping future agendas” (document A/69/183)  which outlined how UNESCO had sustained — and would expand — gains made during the United Nations Literacy Decade.  Indeed  the Decade had focused on literacy in terms of “learning across the lifespan” and as a “development imperative”.  Without learning  people were at risk of being excluded from opportunities  such as the use of information and communication technologies to make informed life choices.  While the absolute number of illiterate adults had fallen  uneven progress across countries had shown that South and West Asia and sub-Saharan Africa were home to three-quarters of the world’s 780 million illiterate people.  Even high income countries were not immune from such challenges  he said. Education systems were not robust enough to offer meaningful learning opportunities for children  he said  noting that an estimated 250 million primary school age children were failing in reading  writing and maths skills.  Meeting the literacy needs of all age groups was central to building a peaceful world  he said.  For its part  UNESCO would continue play a catalytic role  helping to develop States’ capacities in literacy assistance  scaling up opportunities for women and girls  expanding the knowledge base and monitoring and advocating for literacy on the global agenda.  Going forward  he emphasized  UNESCO would strive to increase action vis-à-vis marginalized girls and women and to build political momentum for literacy. Statements INGRID SABJA (Bolivia)  speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  called for integrated policies with a view to empowering people.  Institutional national support structures were also needed to bolster participation and the United Nations must stand ready to help States in that regard.  Stressing that 2015 was the twentieth anniversary of the World Summit for Social Development  she said poverty was a complex problem involving social development challenges that could not be “automatically” solved using economic policies.  Solutions must focus on people  she said  noting that new collective steps were needed to eliminate practices that were incompatible with people’s dignity  especially for people living under foreign occupation. International cooperation  including South-South and triangular cooperation  were needed to meet international goals  supporting a more integrated  consistent approach to social development that took into account international commitments made  she said.  Further  the World Trade Organization (WTO) must ensure full access to global markets and comply with international agreements.  Turning to youth issues  she urged the United Nations and its partners to fully implement the outcome of the 2011 high-level meeting on young people.  A focus was also needed on the challenges associated with ageing populations  she said  pointing to the Madrid Programme of Action as a guide in that regard.  For its part  the Group intended to submit draft resolutions on the follow-up to the International Year of Older Persons  preparing for the twentieth anniversary of the Year of the Family  and on youth. THOMAS GASS  Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs  spoke on behalf of Wu Hongbo  Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs  saying there was “a growing concern” about the current state of social and humanitarian affairs worldwide. “We must take collective actions that are rooted in and enabled by solidarity and inclusion ” he said.  Member States were in agreement in deliberations on the post-2015 development agenda.  “People — their social progress and the realization of their social rights ” he said  “must be at the centre of development.”  Welcoming progress made and lessons learned since the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals  he emphasized that the new development agenda would be built upon those lessons. Recalling the recently concluded first ever World Conference on Indigenous Peoples  he applauded the commitment made by Member States.  The outcome of the Conference  he said  was a testament to recalibrating social issues within a new context of sustainable development.  With regard to the 2015-2016 Commission for Social Development  with its main theme being “Rethinking and strengthening social development in the contemporary world”  he said that the outcome of the Third Committee’s session would be instrumental in guiding its work. CHARLES P. MSOSA (Malawi)  speaking on behalf of the African Group of States  emphasized the continent’s progress in the last decade in the areas of social and economic development and recognized remaining challenges it faced in the education and health sectors.  The African Union had put in place several policy frameworks and action plans to address social inequality among the social groups under discussion  he continued.  Among them were efforts towards poverty eradication among African families  particularly for women and girls  and an African Union protocol outlining obligations and duties of State parties in promoting and protecting the rights of older persons. Regarding persons with disabilities  he said despite specific plans of action  an insignificant proportion had access to care  rehabilitation and education services.  Recognizing that youth was the continent’s greatest asset  he suggested targeted action plans to invest in development  especially given high unemployment and underemployment rates.  Given the continent’s growth rates and challenges  he urged that when addressing current issues  such as the recent Ebola outbreak  more attention must be given to post-conflict reconstruction and socio-development efforts  such as agriculture and trade. JUAN CARLOS MENDOZA-GARCÍA (Costa Rica)  speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  said 870 million of the 1.2 billion people living in extreme poverty were malnourished  making hunger and poverty among “the worst forms of violation of human rights”.  Eradicating them was an ethical  political  social and economic challenge  he said  adding that measures were needed to promote inclusive development strategies that fostered a more equitable distribution of economic benefits and improved access to basic services.  Full social inclusion required a “renewed” commitment by Governments and societies alike.  For its part  his region would work for a people-centred agenda that reinforced its commitment to poverty eradication and sustainable development  he said.  International cooperation was essential in that regard  as was a reform of the financial and economic system.  His region had had “unprecedented” experience in the implementation of social inclusion programmes through South-South and triangular cooperation  having constantly promoted the rights of women and girls  indigenous peoples and people of African descent  among others.  It was essential to work for the participation of young people in education at all levels  he said  noting also that States should focus more on the issue of ageing populations.  Going forward  the post-2015 development agenda should build on the Millennium Development Goals  he said  stressing the Community’s commitment to that process. ELLISTON RAHMING (Bahamas)  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  said climate change was undermining efforts of small island developing States to achieve sustainable development.  The Samoa Pathway  adopted at the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States last month  reiterated that the phenomenon was threatening their very existence.  Governments were continuing to develop modalities to address social development needs that focused on the interrelatedness of the challenges ahead  he said  using the 2015-2019 strategic plan as an example of embracing a holistic approach to enhancing human development. Further  the Commission on Human Resource Development would begin its work next month by reviewing the region’s education and human resource development progress  while the Council for Human and Social Development was coordinating national efforts to address the challenges of climate change  education  health and health systems development.  Giving an overview of related regional efforts  he said youth were engaged in decision-making through the Caribbean Youth Ambassador Programme.  Noting that estimates showed that there would be more people over the age of 60 than children under the age of 10 by 2030  he urged considering such trends.  For its part  the Community had convened a high-level ministerial meeting on the rights of persons with disabilities in the Caribbean region last year. HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia)  speaking on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  described that group’s efforts to become an integrated regional community.  Stressing the importance of social welfare in such integration  he spoke of a “people-centred” ASEAN  based on effective governance  better living conditions and women’s empowerment  among other aims.  Welcoming the Secretary-General’s recognition of the need to empower people  he added that such a goal was being pursued in the region by further enhancing social development and promoting social justice. On persons with disabilities  he called them central to the ASEAN community and said specific mechanisms had been put in place to develop services for them.  Technical cooperation among ASEAN member States ensured a more disability-inclusive development agenda.  Turning to older persons  he underscored the group’s efforts in sharing and enhancing information through regional meetings.  On youth  he stated that they were critical agents for the group.  He described an ASEAN programme through which 97 young volunteers had been recruited to contribute to the betterment of communities in the region. CHARLES THEMBANI NTWAAGAE (Botswana)  speaking on behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  said that the objectives of the World Summit for Social Development remained as valid today as in 1995.  In many countries  poverty and the absence of integrated  inclusive social development persisted.  The Community’s 15-year strategic road map provided direction for achieving social and economic goals across 12 priority areas  including poverty eradication  measures to fight HIV/AIDS and the promotion of gender equality.  What he called a “severe” lack of resources had  however  hindered its implementation  resulting in “debilitating” effects on Government efforts to enable people to pursue a prosperous life. Hailing the Secretary-General’s call for a United Nations coordinating mechanism to respond to technical assistance requirements  he said the Community hoped to close gaps between national social development policies and the implementation of internationally-agreed development goals.  While gains had been made in the fight against HIV/AIDS  with mortality rates reduced through increased access to anti-retroviral drugs  the cost of the medications was still prohibitive.  Unemployment  notably among youth  was another challenge; his region was focused on transforming economies through “value addition”.  He called on the United Nations to “play its part” in assisting Governments to build capacity so that progress towards implementing the World Summit outcome could be accelerated. THOMAS MAYR-HARTING  speaking on behalf of the European Union Delegation  said that youth unemployment was a major concern for the bloc.  As a result  job  growth and investment measures had become central to European policy.  Indeed  Union members established a guarantee through which all under the age of 25 received an offer of good-quality employment  continued education  apprenticeship or training within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.  The post-2015 development agenda  he added  should ensure that no one is left behind through a comprehensive human-rights-based approach. Turning to older persons  he stressed the need for Government to take active steps to address age discrimination  decent work and social protection for the elderly  including access to adequate pensions  health services  long-term care and protection from elder abuse.  Speaking about persons with disabilities  he underlined the bloc’s commitment to removing barriers — through awareness-raising  financial support  data collection and monitoring  among other measures. INIGO LAMBERTINI (Italy) said inclusive sustainable development could not occur without the full participation of all persons  including those with disabilities.  Italy had developed an action plan for persons with disabilities and  through international cooperation  promoted their empowerment around the world  he said  noting that education  employment and access to public space and transport should be granted to all.  Youth empowerment was another priority issue  with the United Nations having a crucial role to play in ensuring adequate measures were taken to empower young people.  Italy looked forward to taking a new approach to that issue  he said.  As for older persons  he said the Open-ended Working Group on Ageing was an effective instrument  recalling that gender equality must underline that and all other social issues.  TERRI ROBL (United States) said there was a need to focus on the most vulnerable segments of society in shaping the next development agenda.  On the issue of violence against older persons  she noted that elder abuse was an underestimated problem to which effective responses needed to be developed.  The physical and mental consequences of elder abuse  as well as related financial exploitations  had consequences on the public sector  she continued.  Turning to the report of the Secretary-General on persons with disabilities  she underlined her delegation’s support to the principle “leave no one behind”  saying future development assistance would be used to assist related initiatives.  Quality education and literacy were important for social and political progress  she continued.  She also recognized the roles families played in development  saying it was essential to uphold the human rights of all forms of families. NIKOLAI RAKOFSKY (Russian Federation) said national initiatives targeting vulnerable groups included social integration and decent work.  Agreeing with the United Nations belief of links between social  economic and political development  he said his delegation had promoted initiatives aimed at lowering inequality  decreasing poverty  supporting small- and medium-sized enterprises and increasing labour productivity.  The moral health of a society was based on its attention to vulnerable people  he said.  Turning to persons with disability  he mentioned the country’s accessible environment programme aimed at providing unimpeded and free access for all individuals with disabilities.  He pointed to a serious concern  noting that the increase of ageing populations had resulted in an increase in social services.  To support young people  he said his country had provided them with resources  including housing subsidies.  In closing  he noted the important role the traditional family played as a basis for stable social development. DAYLENIS MORENO GUERRA (Cuba) said hunger  extreme poverty and premature death persisted in many countries  with those least responsible for the crises being among the most affected.  The Millennium Development Goals were far from being reached and official development assistance (ODA) was dropping in real terms.  Technology transfer was limited and imposed with conditions  she said  also noting that external debt had been paid several times over  yet was still increasing.  Against that backdrop  more resources must be found for the post-2015 development agenda.  In Cuba  the Goals had been met  despite the criminal blockade imposed by the United States.  The infant mortality rate was among the lowest in world and free  universal health care was provided.  Much could be done if developed countries showed political will  notably to meet ODA pledges  she concluded. LAURA JOHN  a youth delegate from Australia  said that during consultations across her country  more than 10 000 youth had shared their dreams for the world.  “These dreams provide the blueprint for the future they want to help build ” she stressed.  Young Australians “across the board” had raised mental health as a key issue  with suicide the leading cause of death for people aged 16 to 24 years.  Globally  States must better integrate mental health into holistic health responses.  For its part  Australia was supporting 45 000 young people though counselling  education and employment services.  The “Headspace” programme offered a one-stop-shop approach to mental health  drug and alcohol issues and physical health services for young people. MAYANK JOSHI (India) urged concerted global action to overcome poverty  notably through the post-2015 development agenda.  The approach of India’s twelfth five-year plan aimed at achieving faster  sustainable growth  featuring poverty reduction as central to an inclusive strategy.  India attached the utmost priority to the family  with programmes in the areas of housing and shelter  health insurance  employment generation and family planning that focused on supporting households.  The Right to Education Act had fostered “more or less” universalized education  while health interventions had increased life expectancy and bolstered immunization rates among children.  As for the “youth bulge” in India  the 2014 youth policy had recognized the potential of that “demographic dividend” and the Government had aimed at providing them with employment  education and health opportunities. ARINO YAGUCHI (Japan) said that as her Government would continue to be involved in the negotiations for the post-2015 development agenda  the country had taken steps to address a number of related issues.  For its part  Japan had ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities earlier this year.  Further  her country appreciated the active engagement of the Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth and strongly promoted youth volunteering as a form of participation in society.  As “the most rapidly ageing society ” Japan would also cooperate with other Member States to address related challenges.  In closing  she recognized the importance of eliminating the threat of the Ebola virus  noting that the Government had already extended a total of $5 million of financial assistance to that cause. SIMONE FEHR  a youth delegate from Switzerland  said migrant children were victims of serious human rights violations  including the contravention of their basic and universal rights when they migrated unaccompanied by adults.  She stressed that they continued to be the subject of exploitation  detention and forced returns in all parts of the world.  She implored that “migrant children should always be treated as children first and foremost.”  In closing  she said it was imperative that actions were taken to address those grave problems and underlined that there was a great urgency to take action. NIMROD BARKAN (Israel) said his country was committed to promoting the rights of persons with disability through legislation  legal protection  education and active partnerships between Government and civil society.  Pointing out that the elderly were disproportionally at risk of inadequate and insecure income as well as insufficient access to quality health care and other services  he welcomed the appointment by the Human Rights Council of the first Independent Expert on the Human Rights of Older Persons.  On the issue of youth  he noted that in many societies young people were disadvantaged in income  unemployment and poverty.  For its part  Israel had developed programmes aimed at integrating youth into its society. BRUNO RÍOS SÁNCHEZ (Mexico) said that with less than 500 days remaining to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  the international community still faced challenges and that progress had not been the same everywhere.  The post-2015 development agenda had to focus on structural issues  he said  noting that more vulnerable groups had to have their human rights recognized under the rule of law  and there must be effective public policy for development so success was greatest for those who needed it most.  Mexico was seeking to achieve full social development  redesigning programmes for each sector of the population.  The key was to invest in young men and women and to develop their full potential and economic growth.  Empowerment was a crucial tool for doing away with poverty  he implored.  Young people had to count as a priority item on the international agenda  and participate fully.  Recognizing the demographic trend for larger numbers of older persons  he said his delegation had welcomed the establishment within the Human Rights Council of a mandate on the rights of persons with disabilities. PATPICHA TANAKASEMPIPAT  a youth delegate from Thailand  said she was deeply honoured to address the General Assembly on behalf of the children and youth of her country.  Underlining that education was the key to lifting people out of the poverty cycle  she said that both Education for All by 2015 and the Millennium Development Goals had brought momentous changes.  However  she said  there was much left to be done to fully achieve equal rights to basic education for every youth.  PONGSAN AKHUPUTRA  a youth delegate from Thailand  reminded Governments to provide basic  affordable and non-discriminatory health-care services and facilities.  He said youth could have much to contribute in making decisions and taking actions that would make a difference. GUILHERME DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil) said that eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities must be prioritized while not losing the focus on issues that needed special attention  such as the rights of older persons  youth and persons with disabilities.  In many countries  those most in need bore the burden of shrinking social protection policies  rising unemployment and increasing inequality.  The post-2015 agenda offered the opportunity to make adjustments and corrections for the decades to come.  Recent experiences in developing countries showed that those who had invested in social inclusion were now reaping the benefits.  Welcoming the decision of the Human Rights Council to appoint an independent expert on the rights of older persons  he added that the consolidation of their human rights into a specific legally binding document would further strengthen the monitoring and realization of those rights.  Further  he said his Government had stressed the importance of promoting the rights of persons with disabilities in areas such as urbanization  access to education and modern technologies.  Increasing the mobility of children with disabilities was investing in the future  he said.  Brazil had experienced an unprecedented decline in inequality because of its investment in human capabilities and decent work  he concluded  praising the country’s “Family Stipend” programme that protected and supported all forms of families. LIN SHILIE (Singapore) said his country had one of the fastest ageing societies in Asia and was deeply convinced of the value of older persons and the importance of the promotion and protection of their rights.  Singapore had been coordinated in a “whole of Government” approach  adopting a two-pronged strategy  providing accessible and affordable quality care and keeping seniors healthy  active and safe in the community to the largest extent possible.  Reiterating his delegation’s commitment to the implementation of the 2002 Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing  he said Singapore would be well-prepared for the opportunities and challenges that the demographic change would bring to their society. LIBRAN N. CABACTULAN (Philippines) said there was a need to foster an empowering approach to policymaking to achieve inclusive  equitable and sustainable development.  Highlighting the Secretary General’s comprehensive report on the progress made in mainstreaming disability in the development agenda  he said his country welcomed the adoption of the outcome document of the General Assembly high-level meeting on related issues.  However  he noted that more information should be provided on laws  policies and practices  as only 21 Member States and 10 United Nations entities had done so regarding progress made towards the realization of the internationally agreed development goals and the Millennium Development Goals concerning persons with disabilities. MONIA ALSALEH (Syria)  aligning her delegation with the statement delivered on behalf of the “Group of 77”  said that her Government was continuing to develop solutions to the problem of terrorist armed groups that were attacking the country’s infrastructure.  Syria was establishing new projects for social protection for those most in need  in cooperation with UNHCR and civil society. The Syrian Government was also establishing projects for employment for young people.  The Government was also cooperating with all United Nations bodies and various social and non-governmental organizations for providing the technical and logistical support for humanitarian work.  Unfortunately  States that had supported terrorist armed groups were taking unilateral coercive measures that were not in accordance with international law.  Such measures were affecting Syria’s social development and undermining the Government’s work.  Citing the 2013 Department of Economic and Social Affairs report  she added that the sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies had had a negative impact on the livelihood of Syrians.  She said such coercive measures were imposed unilaterally and violated their rights to development and social growth. GHOLAMHOSSEIN DEHGHANI (Iran) said that his country had always emphasized the empowerment of people as it sought to achieve poverty eradication  social integration and full employment  which were priority themes across its five-year development plans.  Global attention to the situation of persons with disabilities had been the focus of a 2013 high-level meeting  he said  adding that at the national level  Iran would in two weeks hold the first national conference on entrepreneurship for persons with disabilities.  Sport also played an important role in the empowerment of persons with disabilities  he said  noting the many Iranian achievements in the Paralympic Games.  The promotion and protection of the rights of older persons were also of great importance to his Government  which was developing and implementing an integrated national policy for the elderly. JOANNA BLOSSNER  a youth delegate from Sweden  speaking for her country’s children and youth and for 700 000 young people engaged in over 80 different organizations  said that girls and boys faced different expectations in life and were often given different opportunities.  Underlining that access to education was both a fundamental human right and a key to the development of one’s full potential  she said 65 million girls across the world were not in school.  To remedy that  she called for investing in girls to reduce poverty  improve health and advance equality.  The world was facing a time of significant change  she said  adding that the progress and participation of the most marginalized were essential to succeed.  It was essential to focus on long-term sustainable development and to recognize the vital role of women for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security  she concluded. FODÉ SECK (Senegal) underscored the close link between the elimination of poverty and social development.  Drawing attention to the twentieth anniversary of the International Year of Family  he stressed the strategic importance of the family and its inclusion in the post-2015 development agenda.  Also essential for improved social development was greater participation of such vulnerable groups as women  people with disability  youth and the elderly in decision-making processes at all levels.  Measures undertaken by his Government included the introduction of a universal health care system in 2013  which covered 80 per cent of its population  a programme to raise the level of education for vulnerable families and a microfinancing scheme for female entrepreneurs. ANDREJ LOGAR (Slovenia) said that the lives of the older and younger generations were becoming increasingly interwoven and interdependent.  For its part  Slovenia was addressing the challenges associated with demographic changes in a holistic manner and considered it vital to develop various mechanisms established in this area in a cohesive way.  Applauding the appointment of Matte Kornfeld as the new independent expert on the rights of older persons  he welcomed her “on an early visit to Slovenia”.  The rights of older persons needed to be protected to ensure their safe and independent lives  free from discrimination and abuse  he said. MIHA PONGRAC  a youth delegate from Slovenia  said that young people were becoming increasingly aware that formal education could offer only a part of the knowledge and skills needed to effectively transition from schooling to the job market.  Formal  informal and non-formal education were still insufficiently interlinked  he said  adding that although young people showed high potential and efficiency to work  their employment was insecure  based on short  fixed-term or temporary contracts.  Finally  he stressed the need for including young people in decision-making processes  as there could be no peace or prosperity without the full and equal participation of young people all over the world. JILT VAN SCHAYIK  a youth delegate from the Netherlands  said that growing up in a small village  everyone had similar dreams and that “the world had become a village now”.  As a youth delegate  he had debated with Dutch students and participated in development programmes in the slums of Mumbai.  Everywhere  he had come across young people making an impact on their societies.  “Why was it that young people continued to be under-represented in decision-making processes?” he asked.  It was time to finally bridge the gap between young people and the United Nations  he said  stressing the importance of including not just educated youth in capital cities but also marginalized youth.  “Far away from New York  there was a world of young people whose voices were never heard ” he said.  All Member States should include youth representatives in their delegations to the seventieth General Assembly  he concluded. CLARISA SOLÓRZANO (Nicaragua)  aligning her delegation with the “Group of 77”  said that measures were needed to encourage inclusive development  including access to basic services.  Highlighting national efforts undertaken to satisfy basic human needs of people  she also said rights were recognized in a more participatory society.  Following the country’s economic growth  Nicaragua developed 39 social programmes aimed at eradicating poverty.  Turning to gender  she noted that strong legislation and programmes  a women’s committee and other policies had been established to strengthen the family and prevent violence. RAJA REZA BIN RAJA ZAIB SHAH (Malaysia) said it was time for Governments to introduce policies that empowered individuals so that they could act as catalysts for social development.  Taking stock of his country’s achievements  he said that at the national level  the overarching legal framework aimed at developing resilient and caring Malaysian families.  The family policy provided for the implementation of programmes such as “Parenting at work” and the “Smart start pre-marital programme” that met the needs of families.  Further  the Government recognized youth as a critical driver in national development and would continue to employ the principle of engagement and participation of youth leadership  he said  pointing out that as a result  youth volunteerism was on the rise.  Noting that by the year 2030 Malaysia was expected to attain “ageing nation” status  he stressed the importance of fostering national and international policies to protect older persons. MARÍA EMMA MEJÍA VÉLEZ (Colombia) said that poverty eradication was a prerequisite for social development and that the new development agenda should mainly focus on it.  Public policies could make a difference  she added  saying that the State had the tools to develop a legal framework and infrastructure to empower citizens and improve social development.  Therefore  the capacity of national institutions needed to be improved.  The twentieth anniversary of the International Year of the Family was an opportunity for empowerment.  Bearing in mind the numbers of families headed by single mothers  grandparents or older siblings  she called for their challenges to be addressed.  ISABELA BANY  a youth delegate from Poland  said that the United Nations Charter was a reminder to the international community that it should not be satisfied by past achievements alone.  Recalling the Polish revolution of 1989  she said that the improvement of economic conditions in her country was a result of a solidarity movement that recognized the need for political and economic reform to improve the standards of living of ordinary Polish people.  Drawing on that experience  Poland had valid reasons to claim that sustainable development could not be achieved without the rule of law.  Modern youth were seeking the right to representation  she added.  The younger generation did not want to be limited to a role as an observer.  The advancement of the youth agenda required their inclusion in civil society and enhancing procedures for recruitment of young professionals in international organizations. KAMIL PRUCHNIK  a youth delegate from Poland  said that developing economies were growing faster than advanced economies.  Many countries  however  had not implemented public strategies that would enable social growth and reduce inequalities.  Recent studies by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank suggested that those countries that had made it into the high-income groups had invested in a high stock of social and human capital.  In other words  economic development required people that were well-educated and had good ideas  institutions that could transform those ideas and infrastructure to make those ideas accessible. KAIRAT ABDRAKHMANOV (Kazakhstan) said  against a backdrop of global challenges that included instability  fiscal crisis  escalation of conflicts  huge flows of refugees and displaced persons  outbreaks of diseases  food and energy crises  and increasing poverty  it was clear that social development policies had failed to reach certain vulnerable social groups.  Recommendations made in the Secretary-General’s report on social development were in unison with Kazakhstan’s 2050 development strategy.  Kazakhstan wanted to reach higher social standards and provide improved education and quality health care  especially for the unemployed and persons with disabilities  he said  providing an overview of ongoing projects and programmes.  In closing  he congratulated Member States for sending brilliant youth representatives who would be prime ministers  presidents and heroes of their countries in the future. NEGASH KEBRET (Ethiopia) said that his country’s Constitution provided citizens with full guarantees for the promotion and protection of their social and economic rights by empowering them to receive essential social services and social protection  particularly in education and health sectors and by ensuring better access to decent job employment.  Based on that approach  the Government had adopted a National Social Policy by putting in place an effective social protection system that ensured the inclusion of all its citizens in socioeconomic development.  Recognizing disability as a cross-cutting issue  the Government had taken a number of steps  including developing a specific programme to meet the needs of children with disabilities and  at the university level  special needs education  including sign language courses and Braille  he concluded. NICHOLA NOKULUNGA SABELO (South Africa) said that the recent Ebola outbreak had highlighted the importance of building health systems in developing countries.  Her country faced common developing world challenges and “the journey was far from finished”  she said.  Her Government was implementing a comprehensive social protection framework that combined various elements such as income support  compulsory education and subsidized housing  electricity and sanitation for those who qualified.  South Africa was a youthful nation  she said  recognizing the importance of utilizing that demographic.  For its part  the Government was hard at work addressing the unemployment gap.  Concluding  she said her country also supported the Madrid Plan of Action. DIA A. A. ABUBAKER (Libya) said that the leaders of the world had committed themselves during the Copenhagen Summit to take measures to achieve lasting social and economic growth so that all people could have a dignified life.  Despite some progress  the situation was deteriorating and ordinary people were less and less optimistic.  The international community needed to cope with the new challenge of Ebola and the massive and terrible destruction caused by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS) and State terrorism.  It was most regrettable that after all the sacrifices made in 2011 there was instability in Libya  adversely affecting social growth.  Libyan authorities were redoubling efforts to fill all the gaps that had accumulated over the last few years.  In closing  he said protecting disabled women and children and integrating youth into development were high priorities for Libya. AMEENA AL-MALKI (Qatar) said there were persistent challenges in implementing equitable development and eliminating poverty.  She recognized as a priority the empowerment of all individuals  especially among vulnerable groups.  Based on the importance of empowerment in consolidating efforts to combat poverty  she continued  the institutional mechanisms to address these challenges had been developed.  She also recognized the role played by the family in the development of her country.  Conscious of the need to protect the family  as well as to develop its capacity  she said the Government had established the Doha Institute of the Family.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-07,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaef3395.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Efforts to reduce income inequality within and among countries under the sustainable development goals would require theoretical and technical advances  the Second Committee (Economic and Financial) heard today as delegates met for the general debate of the sixty-ninth session. Janet C. Gornick  Director of the Luxembourg Income Study Cross-National Data Center  said more and better quality data were needed  particularly disaggregated data  if efforts to improve income growth among the bottom 40 per cent of the world’s population were to be meaningful.  To study inequality trends in real time  greater standardization of data was necessary  as was timely processing  while legal restrictions needed to be removed and new  better-resourced strategies developed. Ms. Gornick  who is also a Professor of Political Science and Sociology at the City University of New York  described the work of the Luxembourg Income Study’s data archive in contextualizing inequality.  She painted a portrait of global inequality levels  noting that inequality had grown worldwide over the past 30 years  harming equity and justice  as well as social cohesion and democratic processes. Among the causes of inequality  she pointed to globalization  which contributed to a reduction in the number of jobs available in high and upper middle-income countries  as well as the increased “financialization” of the global economy  as capital markets and institutions grew in importance.  Simultaneous erosion of limits on executive compensation  changes to household structures  and the end of Governments’ redistributive policies also boosted inequality. Thomas Gass  Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs  also drew attention to the structural imbalances that remained in many countries.  Delivering an opening statement on behalf of the Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs  he stressed the need to continue stimulating global demand and output growth  but added that attention should be paid to the high rates of unemployment in developed and developing countries  and to the environmental impacts of growth.  States needed to invest adequate resources in eradicating poverty  and to focus on job creation and health care. Turning to the upcoming session  the Committee Chair  Sebastiano Cardi (Italy)  stressed the importance of a holistic vision of human prosperity that integrated economic  social  and environmental development and saw the interrelated  intergenerational  and global nature of development challenges.  With the session coming on the cusp of “a new era for development”  the policy choices it recommended would impact long-term sustainability  and the Committee could contribute to and enrich debate on attaining sustainable development. Among the major themes discussed was the post-2015 development agenda and the representative of Bolivia  speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  was one of many delegates to tackle that issue  stressing the importance of poverty eradication in all future development activities.  Poverty was multidimensional and had to be central to the agenda  while a strengthened  scaled-up global partnership was vital and should be quantified  with time-bound targets consistent with Millennium Development Goal 8. Several other representatives focused on additional aspects of the Rio+20 outcome document and its centrality to negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda.  Indonesia’s representative  speaking on behalf of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  noted that the document acknowledged the importance of technology as a key means for implementing sustainable development  and he looked forward to discussing arrangements for a facilitation mechanism. Echoing the importance of building means of implementation  the representative of Costa Rica  speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  recognized that an effective strategy would require mobilization of new and additional financial resources.  Like many delegates  he looked ahead to the third international conference on financing for development and stressed that official development assistance (ODA) would remain central. The representative of Benin  who spoke on behalf of the Group of Least Developed Countries  called for cancellation of the outstanding multilateral and bilateral debt held by such countries  while the representative of Nicaragua called for an end to the system of “exploitation of the majority by the minority”  welcoming the recent adoption of a resolution on sovereign debt restructuring  and anticipating follow-up on the draft legal framework. Many delegations  including the European Union  looked forward to the upcoming Lima and Paris Conferences of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  To that end  he called for a single  global and comprehensive legally-binding agreement  stressing the centrality of tackling climate change to sustainable development  and noting its potential impact on poverty eradication efforts. Meanwhile  for States like Nauru  whose representative spoke on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States  future agreements had to build on previous work  notably the recent Conference on Small Island Developing States.  She said she would be vigilant to ensure that the commitments made in Samoa remained prominent in the Committee’s work. Also speaking today were representatives of Belize (on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM))  Malawi (on behalf of the African Group)  Belarus  Switzerland  Egypt  Turkey  Iraq  Kazakhstan  South Africa  Iran  Algeria  Brazil  Democratic Republic of the Congo  Colombia  Israel  New Zealand  Russian Federation  Norway  Georgia  Morocco  Haiti  Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  Cuba  Libya  Syria  Mexico  Malaysia  and Japan. Committee Chair Sebastiano Cardi (Italy) notified delegates of adjustments to the Committee’s programme of work as contained in document A/C.2/69/L.1.  They were the postponement of a side event  cancellation of a joint meeting between the Second Committee and the Economic and Social Council  and the rescheduling of the meeting on “Eradication of poverty and other development issues”. The Second Committee will meet again at 10 a.m.  on 8 October to continue its general debate. Opening Remarks SEBASTIANO CARDI (Italy) Chair  Second Committee (Economic and Financial)  listed the many formidable challenges the world faced  stressing that the Ebola outbreak put at risk gains made in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  To deal with that and other challenges  multilateral action was essential.  The Committee was positioned to make a final push to achieve the Millennium Goals and to contribute to formulation of the new agenda.  Its broad agenda covered most key issues central to development of societies  so it was well placed to do so.  It was necessary to build on achievements made in areas like the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  and it was vital to establish adequate means of implementation and to forge a strengthened global partnership for development. He noted that the current session came as the world was about to embark on “a new era for development”.  The Committee could contribute to and enrich debate on attaining sustainable development  but it should be wary of duplicating work and should remain effective  efficient and impactful.  Improvements to working methods would help with that  and some had already been made.  Development challenges and their attendant risks were interrelated  intergenerational  and universal  and policy choices would impact long-term sustainability.  A holistic vision of human prosperity  recognizing the integration and global nature of economic  social  and environmental development  should guide the Committee to policy cooperation and coherence.  The Committee could evolve new tools and instruments for effective macroeconomic policies  and could focus on development financing  operational activities for development  and defining a new global partnership for development. THOMAS GASS  Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs of the Department of Economic and Social Council  speaking on behalf of the Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Council  said the global economy continued to expand at a moderate pace  but structural imbalances and social and political tensions bedevilled many countries.  Stimulating global demand and output growth should remain a priority  but attention should be paid to the environmental impacts of such growth.  The rate of unemployment remained high in both developed and developing countries  he said  calling on States to invest adequate resources in eradicating poverty  and to focus on job creation and health care  among other areas. On the post-2015 development agenda  he said the Samoa Pathway document left no doubt that the issues of small island developing States were global issues.  The sustainable development goals went further than the Millennium Development Goals  and included targets on issues such as sustainable energy for all  climate change  sustainable patterns of consumption and production  and the protection of oceans  seas and forests.  A comprehensive financing framework for the post-2015 agenda was a major challenge  and he also highlighted the strengthening of statistics  data  and monitoring as priorities.  The Department of Economic and Social Affairs had taken steps to provide coherent assistance to countries pursuing sustainable development  and supported them in strengthening their national statistical systems. Keynote Address JANET C. GORNICK  Professor of Political Science and Sociology at the City University of New York  and Director of the Luxembourg Income Study Cross-National Data Center  focused her remarks on “High and rising inequality: Causes and consequences”.  She described the study and its work on data collection  noting that most data came from high and upper-middle income countries.  Income was not an effective measure of well-being in poorer countries  so data was sparse and consumption was the preferred method for measuring inequality.  Findings on middle and high-income countries were still relevant to lower income countries  however. Income inequality was higher in middle-income countries  she said  noting that Nordic countries were the least unequal  and the highest ranked high-income countries were both English-speaking.  That suggested that institutions mattered.  In the past 30 years  income inequality had risen in two-thirds of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries.  That was a “substantial and significant” increase showing that wealthy households benefited more from growth than middle and lower income households.  Inequality declined between 2007 and 2010 because of the recession  and she looked forward to studying the effects of the recovery on equality.  There was a consensus that inequality — though still high — had declined in many Latin American countries  with more equal wages and more progressive and robust Government transfers providing lessons for policymakers.  Several countries had seen “hollowing out of the middle”  and problematic consequences were expected in the future. She outlined the causes of growing inequality  including globalization and “financialization”.  The latter related to the increased importance of capital markets and institutions.  Changing pay norms  including the erosion of limits on executive compensation  contributed to inequality  as did changes to household structures  such as the rise of one-adult households  and the end of Governments’ redistributive policies.  Women’s engagement in paid work had risen in the previous three decades  with their contribution to household income helping to pull the bottom up. Increased inequality could harm equity and justice  she said  noting that such consequences would be particularly powerful if correlated with reduced living standards for those at the bottom.  Intergenerational mobility could also be curtailed  along with overall economic growth.  Economist Joseph Stiglitz had asserted that the rich could only consume so much and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had agreed  stressing that economic growth and inequality had been two sides of the same coin  and drawing a link between inability to sustain growth and inequality.  Social cohesion and the democratic process could also be impacted. She said the new proposed sustainable development goals included an effort to reduce inequality within and among countries  aiming particularly to raise growth among the bottom 40 per cent.  Theoretical and technical advances were needed to properly conduct such a study.  More and higher quality data were needed  particularly disaggregated data  with more standardization and timely processing in order to learn about inequality and monitor it in real time.  Restrictions needed to be removed  while new strategies were vital and more resources mobilized.  Resources were required for national statistics offices  for projects such as the Luxembourg Income Study  and for opportunities for volunteers to join in the data revolution. Discussion Following Ms. Gornick’s address  the floor was opened to discussion  with the representative of Guyana asking a question about inequality between countries  to which she responded that she was not an expert in cross-country inequality.  Instead  she pointed to the work of Economist Branko Milanović on global income distribution  which had turned up the paradoxical finding that rising inequality within countries was met with shrinking inequality internationally.  China and India had achieved a great economic expansion and that was one reason for the results.  She also addressed his question about anti-inequality policies  noting the impact of minimum wages  and the importance of implementing collective agreements. Responding to questions from the representatives of Guatemala and Senegal about alternative measures of inequality  she said she supported multi-dimensional  integrated approaches and was working to increase the number of measures brought in play. The representative of Ireland asked a question about data quality  to which she responded that efforts were being made to integrate domestic labour into income surveys  and she responded to a question from the representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo about whether inequality should be tackled after growth had been achieved  by saying that growth was not necessary to tackle inequality. The representatives of Iran  Mongolia and Liberia also asked questions during the discussion  but she said they went outside her area of expertise. Statements SACHA SERGIO LLORENTTY SOLÍZ (Bolivia)  speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  looked forward to negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda  preparations for and follow-up to several conferences  and strengthening the institutional framework for sustainable development.  Poverty eradication and achieving sustainable development’s three dimensions were vital to forming a coherent approach to the post-2015 development agenda.  That agenda should adhere to the Rio Principles  particularly that of common but differentiated responsibilities  and the report of the Open Working Group on the sustainable development goals should not be re-negotiated.  Poverty was multidimensional and should be central to the agenda  while a strengthened and scaled-up global partnership for development was an essential element.  The partnership needed quantified  time-bound targets consistent with Millennium Development Goal 8.  North-South cooperation could be complemented by South-South and triangular cooperation. Technology was a driver of sustainable development  he said  calling for agreement on a technology facilitation mechanism.  Sovereign debt management was crucial  especially for developing countries  and resolution A/RES/68/304 was a step towards establishing a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring.  Climate change impacted particularly powerfully on developing countries  and the twentieth conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was of vital importance in preparing a road map for Paris.  A global implementation mechanism was needed to achieve the goals of the Samoa Pathway document  and the Second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries should conclude a holistic programme of action.  Aid to Africa had to double  while the Istanbul Programme of Action should continue and help graduation to middle-income status.  The Ebola outbreak underscored the need to tackle the cycle of disease and to assist affected countries.  He addressed the economic and social repercussions of the Israeli occupation of Palestine  and rejected unilateral sanctions on Cuba  Sudan  Iran and Syria. LOIS MICHELE YOUNG (Belize)  speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  and the Alliance of Small Island States  said that over the past year some of its member States had seen recovery in tourism and agriculture  with positive spin-off effects on other sectors.  However  despite those gains  the region witnessed high levels of unemployment and increased indebtedness.  Those challenges  coupled with the sensitivity of the Caribbean economies to extra regional source markets  were further compounded by the region’s vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change impacts  and its dependence on imports for food and fuel. She said that the small island developing States’ agenda would be a critical component in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda  with the Samoa Pathway document providing a foundational input towards shaping the agenda in a manner that addressed the challenges faced by those countries.  In the context of financing for development  she emphasized the question of external debt sustainability.  Having attained middle-income status on account of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita  many of CARICOM member States had lost access to concessionary financing  and had undertaken significant debt to finance their resilience.  In that regard  the international community should reconsider the metrics for determining access to financing  including consideration of a vulnerability index. WILLIAM JOSÉ CALVO CALVO (Costa Rica)  speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  said that efforts to address the pending agenda of the Millennium Development Goals and build on that experience must be accelerated.  The Open Working Group report must be the basis for integrating the sustainable development goals into the post-2015 development agenda  and it should not be reopened or renegotiated.  On financing for sustainable development  he recognized that an effective strategy would require the mobilization and use of new and additional financial resources  public and private  domestic and international  but that official development assistance (ODA) should play a central role in achieving internationally agreed development goals. He highlighted the importance of establishing a strengthened global partnership for development with effective means of implementation  including a mix of financial resources  technology development and transfer  as well as capacity-building.  Technology cooperation was the linchpin for promoting sustainable development in the post-2015 context  and the international community must start working on a mechanism to improve the flow of knowledge  capacities  and resources to where they would make a difference.  While he recognized the contribution and complementarity of the private sector in financing for sustainable development  he did not think that such engagement and partnerships should replace the historical commitments of developed countries in providing ODA. DESRA PERCAYA (Indonesia)  speaking on behalf of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  and associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  looked forward to the achievement of important milestones.  Those included an agreement on the post-2015 development agenda; the Third Financing for Development Conference; and the follow-up to the Rio+20 Conference  particularly the technology facilitation mechanism and the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.  The Committee should focus on achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  Like many regions  ASEAN countries lagged on achievement of some goals.  He described where ASEAN would focus  as outlined in the “Joint Declaration on the Attainment of the MDGs in ASEAN” and the “ASEAN Roadmap for the Attainment of the MDGs”.  The post-2015 development agenda had to focus on poverty eradication  with a transformative approach to the world’s challenges  including global systemic reforms. The Rio+20 outcome document had acknowledged the importance of technology as a key means of implementation for sustainable development  he said  noting that the Open Working Group on the Sustainable Development Goals had reiterated that.  Recommendations on arrangements for a facilitation mechanism had been adopted  and further discussion in the Committee should find a conclusion.  The Conference on Financing for Development was vital to the new development agenda  and the Monterrey Consensus a valid reference point.  A vital principle in pursuit of a new climate change agreement was that of common but differentiated responsibilities.  Developed countries should lead on reducing emissions and building climate resilience  with the developing world doing its utmost to contribute.  The ASEAN Community would be established in 2015  when the ASEAN Economic Community became a reality.  ASEAN would continue to look outward  remaining an inclusive and market-driven economy  sustaining its economic and trade performance. CHARLES P. MSOSA (Malawi)  speaking on behalf of the African Group and associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that with a billion people still trapped in extreme poverty  its eradication must remain the overarching goal of any future transformative development agenda.  He highlighted ending hunger  ensuring food security and nutrition  and promoting sustainable agriculture as priorities for the region.  The recent African Union Summit had seen its leaders commit to allocating 10 per cent of public expenditure to agriculture  as well as to at least double current agricultural productivity levels and to sustain agricultural GDP growth of at least 6 per cent.  Moreover  they had undertaken to triple  by 2025  intra-African trade in agricultural commodities and services  and to fast track the establishment of the Continental Free Trade Area and transition to a continental Common External Tariff scheme.  If implemented successfully  Africa would have enough food for its entire population  and would not have to spend $35 billion a year on food imports. On climate change  he said that Africa was most vulnerable to its adverse impacts due to its low adaptive capacity.  The land was vital for agriculture and food production; however  nearly three fourths of it was estimated to be degraded to varying degrees.  Moreover  the region  where many people depended on natural resources for their livelihoods  was affected by frequent and severe droughts.  Stressing the potentially profound positive impacts of increasing sustainable land management and building resilience to drought in Africa  he called on Member States to support and strengthen the implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and the 10-year strategic plan and framework to enhance the timely financial resources. MARLENE MOSES (Nauru)  speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States and associating herself with the Group of 77 and China and CARICOM  said the session would set the stage for endorsement of the post-2015 development agenda.  Other intergovernmental processes  on disaster risk reduction  financing for development and climate change  would impact the agenda  but follow-up to the Conference on Small Island Developing States was vital and commitments made there had to remain prominent in the Committee’s work.  Promising to remain vigilant  she outlined some views and ambitions expressed by small island State leaders  including the need to agree to a post-2015 agenda that built on the Samoa Pathway.  Sustainable development goals should acknowledge the special vulnerabilities such States faced  with specific support given and efforts to build a global enabling environment.  That included robust follow-up to the Barbados Programme of Action  Mauritius Strategy of Implementation and the Samoa Pathway. The new agenda needed to integrate the three pillars of sustainable development  she said  underlining the need to recognize links between economic  social and environmental aspects.  There was a need for a global compact reflecting the collective political will of small island developing States to support sustainable development  focused on improving resilience  competitiveness and development financing.  Those island States were custodians of vast expanses of oceans  so they needed ownership of strategies on fisheries  tourism  seabed resources  and sources of renewable energy.  Gaps in implementation of previous agreements related to those States needed addressing and cooperation  and partnership had to be built from national to international levels.  The High-Level Political Forum would review and follow-up on implementation of sustainable development commitments and objectives.  Small island developing States needed special resourcing and technology transfers  as well as assistance in improving national institutions.  Traditional and indigenous knowledge could drive sustainable development and greater levels of assistance should be provided  including favourable trade and economic agreements. IOANNIS VRAILAS (European Union) referred to drama over his delegation’s position in the speaker’s list  noting that it was the fourth occasion since adoption of resolution 65/276  and that the issue should have disappeared.  The Union was always constructive in negotiations and it was the substance of its statements that were important  not its position in the list.  The body was the most important on development and humanitarian aid  and was at the forefront of efforts to tackle climate change.  It showed respect to other groups  and hoped for reciprocation of such respect.  Intergovernmental processes associated with the 2015 Climate Summit would include inputs from many stakeholders.  The Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing was crucial to discussions on the global partnership  acknowledging that the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration provided the conceptual framework for the post-2015 agenda  for resource mobilization from many sources and for the effective use of financing.  The Secretary-General’s report would synthesize the inputs to help move discussions forward. Climate change would remain a central challenge to sustainable development  he said  noting its potential impact on poverty eradication efforts.  Economies had to get on a path to low-emission  climate resilient development  with climate action a catalyst for sustainable development.  The Lima Conference should build on previous work towards a single  global and comprehensive legally-binding agreement.  Noting the importance of countries in special situations  he underlined the importance of gender equality and women’s economic empowerment to sustained  inclusive economic growth  poverty eradication and sustainable development.  The implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and its Programme of Action were essential to the promotion  protection and fulfilment of women’s rights.  He looked forward to strengthening the Committee’s working methods  and ensuring it remained relevant  effective and efficient. JEAN-FRANCIS RÉGIS. ZINSOU (Benin)  speaking on behalf of the Group of Least Developed Countries and associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said the Ebola crisis demonstrated the vulnerability of the least developed States in the face of new and emerging challenges.  However  despite their high vulnerabilities and low capabilities  the particular needs of those countries were overlooked in the global search of policy solutions and responses to climate change.  The post-2015 agreement should include legally binding commitments on serving their adaptation needs.  The adaptation financing should supplement the historical commitment of 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of ODA to those countries. He said that there had been a moderate pick-up in economic activity in many least developed countries  with the Group’s GDP having accelerated from 4.3 per cent in 2012 to 5.6 per cent in 2013.  However  poverty had continued to be pervasive  with half of people in those countries living on less than $1.25 a day.  He urged development partners to fulfil their existing ODA commitments and review them with a view to allocating at least 50 per cent of their ODA to the least developed countries.  Moreover  he called for all outstanding debt  both multilateral and bilateral  of all least developed countries to be written off  and future development assistance to be grant-based to avert the recurrence of debt unsustainability. VALENTIN RYBAKOV  Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus  said that although some Millennium Development Goals had been marginally achieved  the progress had been unequal in various parts of the world.  More than one billion people still lived in extreme poverty  most of them in middle-income countries.  In the context of the post-2015 development agenda  new sustainable development goals had been proposed  but it remained unresolved whether they had the resources and mechanisms needed to achieve them.  Moreover  he called energy the “fuel for sustainable development” and a key area for human livelihood  asking for energy-related issues to be addressed at a more systemic and consistent level  through a United Nations energy agenda. PAUL SEGER (Switzerland) reiterated his support for a single post-2015 agenda to address poverty eradication and sustainable development  containing a single set of objectives  along with an integrated financing mechanism  and a monitoring and accountability framework.  With 11 months left to be creative and ambitious in order to realize a shared vision  the preparatory process towards the Post-2015 Summit should be well-structured  with focused and inclusive sessions.  For a successful implementation of the post-2015 agenda on the ground  the political level of the United Nations must be linked to the Organization’s development system. AMR ABDELLATIF ABOULATTA (Egypt)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  said the international community must seek to realize the Millennium Development Goals before 2015  and benefit from the accumulated lessons and experience in its efforts to eradicate poverty.  The post-2015 development agenda should build on the Rio+20 outcome document  and sustainable development could only be achieved through a global partnership recognizing differences between countries.  He emphasized the need to close the technological gap to realize sustainable industrialization and development  and to address the issue of food security. YASAR HALIT CEVIK (Turkey) said that  in the context of both developing and developed countries still experiencing adverse effects of the global economic and financial crisis  the international community should find a way to create an environment for increased production  trade and investment  and jobs.  The burden of global economic challenges was most felt by the least developed countries  landlocked developing countries and small island developing States  which benefited least from globalization  but suffered the most from its adverse effects on growth  employment and social welfare.  His country had pledged a voluntary financial contribution of $200 000 to assist the establishment of the Technology Bank and science  technology and innovation (STI) supporting mechanism in Turkey to address technological needs of the least developed countries. YUONUS HUSSEIN (Iraq)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  underlined that debt prevented development  particularly fulfilment of international development goals.  Finding a solution to the problem was important and would help States to absorb shocks locally.  The adoption of a resolution on restructuring of sovereign debts was a step in the right direction.  He supported the establishment of a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring  noting that Iraq had suffered from “dirty and ugly debts”.  Nationally  resources should be distributed in a judicial manner  focused on weaker groups  like women and children.  There was a link between development and human security  and the report of the Open Working Group should have made greater mention about combating terrorism  because it was a problem affecting the entire world. KAIRAT ABDRAKHMANOV (Kazakhstan) pointed out a steady stream of successful reforms  while noting that worldwide recovery required efficient  global policymaking.  The Astana Economic Forums developed a draft concept Anti-Crisis Plan for the United Nations  and he hoped the General Assembly and Economic and Social Council would consider it.  Kazakhstan was preparing for the Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries  but the situation of small island developing States was also concerning.  Kazakhstan joined the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) in backing a biogas project for nine small island States in the region.  He was reviewing the national level significance of the report of the Open Working Group on the Sustainable Development Goals and the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing.  In transition to a “green economy”  Kazakhstan was committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions  while the Astana Expo 2017 would focus on “Future Energy”.  Recalling Kazakhstan’s environmentally hazardous areas  including the Aral Sea and the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site  he said a draft resolution on Semipalatinsk would be submitted to the Committee. THEMBELA NGCULU (South Africa) said that leading up to the September 2015 Summit on the Post-2015 Development Agenda  a truly transformative outcome “must address the triple challenges of poverty  unemployment and inequality faced by many developing countries”.  He urged Member States to retain a “strictly developmental” focus and theme.  He pointed to the responsibility of developed States in assisting developing countries with concrete actions  and called for the establishment of an accountability framework under the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development to monitor the delivery of those commitments.  He stressed however that because systemic fragilities and imbalances in the international financial system have had negative consequences on the flow and mobilization of finance  the cure is good economic governance and the reform of international financial institutions to become more “representative and responsive to the needs of developing countries”. GHOLAMHOSSEIN DEHGHANI (Iran)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  described important developments taking place in the realm of sustainable development over the coming months.  Processes should not distract and substance needed to be given due weight.  Each country had the right to choose its own route to development and its own strategies.  The financial and economic crisis had hampered the abilities of developing countries to meet their development needs  and the international financial and monetary systems needed urgent reform so that they were better equipped to respond to the needs of developing countries.  Despite brutal unilateral  coercive economic measures  Iran had met the Millennium Development Goals at the national level. SABRI BOUKADOUM (Algeria)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  said that sustainable development required more work from States  and the aim should be the establishment of a more balanced and just economic world order.  Adoption of the report of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals was the building block for the future development agenda  and the nature of negotiations on that matter should be emulated going forward.  The Lima Conference could pave the way towards a legally binding climate regime.  The Conference on Financing for Development would identify obstacles and constraints affecting implementation of the Monterrey Consensus.  The aim was to ease the situation for African States.  Sovereign debt restructuring was a major area that should be dealt with through international intergovernmental processes. GUILHERME DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  said it was important to stick to the core of the Rio+20 agreement  which was eradicating poverty and reducing inequality.  Neoliberal economic policies had caused wage and wealth disparities to skyrocket  and income inequality was greater among countries than within them.  That situation had serious social  humanitarian and economic consequences.  Growth was stifled as deteriorating incomes reduced demand and weakened the basis for recovery from the 2008 crisis.  Brazil was active with social policies like the “Bolsa Familia” that helped to reduce both poverty and inequality  providing demand-led growth and invigorating the domestic market.  More than 40 million Brazilians had been lifted from poverty and into the middle class.  Doing the same at the international level was complex but not impossible  and the 2010 IMF Governance and Quota Reform should be implemented.  Looking to the Committee’s session  he called for a focus on inequality and sustainable development  and outlined his ambitions for its work. PAUL LOSOKO EFAMBE (Democratic Republic of the Congo)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the African Group  said the post-2015 development agenda must be both ambitious and conclusive  and must not side-line any country due to its lack of capacity.  He welcomed the proposal to make poverty eradication the first sustainable development goal  as well as the inclusion of a specific goal on peace and development.  The current situation in the world  particularly the threat of terrorism and the Ebola crisis  posed enormous challenges to the achievement of the goals.  Concerning the Ebola outbreak  his country had been providing assistance to those affected  and would establish training centres for healthcare personnel.  Climate change was a threat  particularly to the most vulnerable  such as the landlocked developing countries in Africa.  “The time for talk has gone  now it is time for action ” he concluded. MARIA EMMA MEJÍA VELÉZ (Colombia)  associating herself with the Group of 77 and China  and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  said the Latin American region had made uncontested steps forward in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  Noting the fundamental role of human settlements in sustainable development  she called for a new people-focused urban agenda.  The post-2015 agenda must respond to the special needs of the least developed countries  small island developing States  and landlocked developing countries  as well as middle-income countries  especially in terms of the latter’s continued access to finance.  The agenda must also include sufficient means and a periodic review framework.  Moreover  a real global alliance must ensure the technology transfer on preferential terms for developing countries. HADAS MEITZAD (Israel) said they had learned valuable lessons from their experience with the Millennium Development Goals.  Since problems were not one size fits all  neither should be their solutions.  The world was a very different place from 14 years ago; new technologies were completely changing people’s lives  and the private sector  philanthropic foundations and civil society were increasingly woven into global affairs.  The new complexities represented both challenges and opportunities to achieve a new development agenda.  Empowering women to control their own reproductive decisions was essential to reducing maternal and child mortality  and enabled them to participate fully in their families  professions and communities.  Entrepreneurship was a primary pathway to break the cycle of poverty  empower women and youth  and achieve economic growth and sustainable development. JIM MCLAY (New Zealand) welcomed the outcome of the small island developing States conference  and looked forward to tackling the issues it had raised.  He also welcomed the report of the Open Working Group.  All States had a responsibility to conclude an ambitious  inclusive and transformative set of sustainable development goals.  Inclusive global partnerships were vital as was development finance mobilization.  The Committee’s engagement on the post-2015 development agenda should remain procedural and technical in order to avoid pre-empting the work done in other processes.  Durable solutions to global debt problems were needed  and sovereign debt restructuring and a consensus-building approach was needed to develop a coordinated policy.  The United Nations was one place for such discussions but others needed to be involved  too. JAIME HERMIDA CASTILLO (Nicaragua)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  stressed his concern that the effects of the economic crisis were still being felt worldwide.  There was no international agreement on responses  and the system of “exploitation of the majority by the minority” continued and called for a restructuring of the international financial architecture.  The resolution on sovereign debt restructuring reflected developing countries’ concerns and States should work in a united  cohesive manner to draft the legal framework for follow-up.  The Conference on Financing for Development was a chance to shape world economic policies and to define a new international financial structure.  Extensive work on drafting the sustainable development goals included agreement on the need for poverty eradication.  To fulfil the proposed goals  resources were needed  along with a stronger global alliance.  The basis for negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda had to be the report of the Open Working Group and the Rio+20 outcome document.  The new agenda must be negotiated through an inclusive  transparent process aimed at achieving a fairer world order based on solidarity  sustainability  inclusion and human dignity. DMITRY I. MAKSIMYCHEV (Russian Federation) said his country’s position remained unchanged  and was opposed to an expansive interpretation of sustainable development and to attempts to politicize the post-2015 development agenda.  With the upcoming Conference on Financing for Development  he looked forward to working out methods for achieving the sustainable development goals.  Sustainable development was hampered by volatility in the global economic and financial situation.  He supported an effective system that maintained the balance necessary to truly achieve it.  Regional and inter-regional mechanisms were needed to forward development.  He pointed to his country’s involvement in the Eurasian Economic Union and the New Development Bank.  Recent events had highlighted the need for comprehensive regulation of sovereign debt markets  and he looked forward to discussions on the modalities.  He would continue to oppose unilateral economic measures  and would play a strong role in discussions over operational activities for development. GEIR O. PEDERSEN (Norway) urged that extra attention be paid to the rights and needs of the marginalized groups who suffered most in crisis and conflict conditions.  Ahead of the target date for the Millennium Development Goals  States must be innovative.  Partnerships with the private sector  civil society and others must be strengthened to secure access to innovative technology  while financing mechanisms  such as results-based financing  must be stimulated.  The post-2015 development agenda must leave no doubt about the importance of peace and stability  good governance  the rule of law  and respect for human rights. Ensuring review mechanisms for the sustainable development goals  including the High Level Political Forum  that drew on inclusive  evidence-based processes would be crucial.  He urged States to consider repositioning the United Nations development system to build on its comparative advantages  and ensuring that expectations about the United Nations were matched by funding. VAKHTANG MAKHAROBLISHVILI (Georgia) said his country’s third national report had found that most of the Millennium Development Goals had been achieved  citing a significant decline in extreme poverty  expansion of social protection schemes  and high primary school enrolment since 2000.  In 2012  women’s representation in Parliament surpassed 10 per cent  up from a 5 per cent baseline in 2000  and since 2006  import duties had been abolished on almost 85 per cent of goods.  Despite progress  poverty remained a concern.  Tackling challenges required common efforts.  International action was the most feasible way to reduce the potential threat of climate change.  The region’s vast energy resources could open opportunities for cooperation among energy producers  transit and consumer countries.  In that context  he said Georgia and its partners were involved in regional and international projects to modernize domestic transport infrastructure. TARIK IZIRAREN (Morocco)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  and the African Group  welcomed the establishment of poverty eradication as the first sustainable development goal  as well as the integration of economic-related goals.  Countries’ economic empowerment and industrialization were the best way to eradicate poverty and inequalities  and a clear multinational mechanism to restructure the debt of States must be established as the world moved towards the post-2015 agenda.  The universality of the agenda should not ignore the specific needs of developing countries  he added  highlighting the importance of ODA and of technology transfer for the achievement of development goals.  South-South cooperation had become increasingly relevant as the means of development based on the principles of equality  partnership and mutual interest. ASTRIDE NAZAIRE (Haiti)  associating herself with the Group of 77  CARICOM  Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  Alliance of Small Island Developing States  and the Group of Least Developed Countries  said it was essential that the Committee adopted clear  practical  action-oriented and people- and environment-centred decisions and resolutions.  Having re-emerged from a terrible 2010 earthquake  Haiti was undergoing an intensive phase of reconstruction and recovery  and had  despite unfavourable circumstances  seen progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  With climate change directly threatening the very existence of small island developing States  her country fully endorsed the Samoa Pathway  which should be the basis for the Committee’s work. KIM UN CHOL (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea)  speaking on the work of the United Nations on sustainable development  said extreme poverty and environmental issues had been caused by “unfair and selfish economic activities”.  He called for the end of “coercive political and military manoeuvres which threaten regional peace and stability”  such as the “unilateral sanctions by the United States and some other countries against specific individual countries in the fields of finance  trade and investment”.  He called for a “new economic order” based on the growing financial importance of emerging economies  a reform of the dollar-based international monetary system and reform of world trade organizations such as the IMF and the World Trade Organization (WTO).  Based on the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities”  he said that individual countries should be allowed to establish their own sustainable development goals  and developed and donor countries should show their commitment through development assistance and the transfer of technologies.  Citing the “wise guidance of the Great Leader Kim Jong Un” he said “improvement of people’s living standards is now being upheld as a top priority” in his country. RODOLFO REYES RODRÍGUEZ (Cuba)  associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Alliance of Small Island Developing States  said the current system was not sustainable.  More progress could have been made on meeting the Millennium Development Goals if the resources had been channelled into development rather than military expenditure.  Furthermore  the global economic and financial system was in crisis  and there was a need for a new  fairer  more inclusive and transparent world order.  The new development agenda had to include ways of funding the Goals  particularly to solve the problem of external debt.  He called for action to ensure that the international trade system promoted development  and that the current irrational patterns of consumption and production were changed.  The situation required an urgent solution  and he hoped that solidarity would prevail over egotism. IBRAHIM O. A. DABBASHI (Libya) aligned with the Group of 77 and China and the African Group  noting that  for various reasons  it was unlikely that impoverished countries would fulfil the Millennium Development Goals in the time remaining.  That unfinished business needed to be included in the new goals.  Were it not for the acute political drama and chaotic security situation in Libya  he believed his country would have fulfilled the Millennium Goals  expressing hope for national reconciliation and consensus to rejuvenate the economy.  Capital flight  together with cross-border smuggling of funds and laundering  hampered development efforts and achievement of those goals.  Cooperation was needed on anti-corruption.  He looked forward to assistance in recovering finances plundered from his State.  Once recovered  they could be directed to development.  He stressed the need to improve the United Nations role in economics and finance  and to learn lessons from the latest economic crisis. RABEE JAWHARA (Syria) aligned himself with the Group of 77 and China  calling for political will to ensure fulfilment of unimplemented commitments.  A renewal of global commitment to ending foreign occupation was needed because it was the major impediment to the development of people living under occupation.  Renewed commitment was also needed to remove all unilateral economic sanctions because everyone agreed sanctions hampered efforts to build economies and sustainable development.  They were also illegitimate because they were imposed unilaterally  not through the United Nations.  He called for efforts to eradicate terrorism in all its forms  especially by targeting its funding.  Commitment was needed on Rio+20 principles such as common but differentiated responsibilities and fulfilment of pledges to increase ODA.  Trade barriers against developing countries needed to be removed  as did politicized objections to their full participation in the international trading system. SARA LUNA CAMACHO (Mexico)  associating herself with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  said her country wanted to strengthen efforts towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals  and to ensure that the post-2015 development agenda was inclusive  transformative and transparent.  The international community should focus on developing a clearer vision on the transformation required  which must contain elements for the implementation of the post-2015 development goals.  Mexico would continue to promote socioeconomic inclusion of young people  women  persons with disabilities  indigenous people  and other vulnerable groups.  The route towards the 2015 Summit must draw on other related processes  particularly on the United Nations Climate Change Conference  to be held in Lima  and the 2015 Conference on Financing for Development. HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia) said States faced the difficult task of ensuring the success of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development  to be held in July 2015.  In outlining the post-2015 development agenda  developing country interests must be kept in mind  while the design  structure and choice of the goals should be in line with what those countries aimed to achieve.  Its formulation and implementation must be in accordance with the Rio Principles  taking into account different national circumstances and capacities.  On climate change  he looked forward to a comprehensive outcome at the Paris Summit next year.  Malaysia was on track to achieve or exceed almost all of the Millennium Goals by 2015  aiming to become a high-income nation by 2020  with an emphasis on inclusiveness and sustainability.  Reaffirming the importance of South-South cooperation  he said it should not be viewed as a substitute for North-South cooperation  but  rather  as a complement to it. HIROSHI MINAMI (Japan) said the most important aspect of the fight against poverty was cultivating a sense of ownership among those concerned and encouraging self-help efforts.  Significant inputs on the post-2015 development agenda had been received by the Committee and Japan had participated actively.  The synthesis report of the Secretary-General would be enriched by the various inputs and would help establish an agenda that stakeholders could implement together.  Financing for development was separate but closely linked to the post-2015 agenda  and coherence and coordination were needed between both to minimize duplication of efforts.  Looking ahead to the 2015 World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction  he hoped its outcome would contribute to the post-2015 agenda.  He said he would make every effort to ensure the Committee was effective  and suggested that reforms might be necessary in light of the likely adoption of a new comprehensive development agenda. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.  United Nations © 2014  New York  NY 10017 About us
2014-10-07,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gadis3497.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) was urged today at the start of its session to move beyond reaffirming long-term goals to concrete actions  as the absence of a results-based approach hindered the United Nations disarmament machinery and  indeed  the work of the Organization itself. Addressing the Committee  Angela Kane  High Representative for Disarmament Affairs  noted the effect of that approach on nuclear disarmament  which  she warned  still lacked specific benchmarks.  However  the most alarming headlines of the day were not about the fearsome prospects of nuclear war  but about armed conflicts raging inside States  often involving non-State actors “armed to the teeth” with some of the most lethal small weapons ever developed. In his opening remarks  the Committee Chair  Courtenay Rattray of Jamaica  said that global peace could reign and collective security could be assured even as Member States asserted the primacy of their respective interests.  He warned  however  of the “dangerous intersection” between the activities of transnational criminal organizations  terrorist groups  State and non-State informal actors and violent extremists that had access to instruments of war  which fuelled instability. Echoing appeals heard throughout the morning for a more tangible path forward in pursuit of disarmament  Indonesia’s representative  speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  said that despite traditional calls for the total elimination of nuclear weapons  concrete steps remained elusive. Compliance by the nuclear-weapon States with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was imperative  and must not be delayed any further  he said  adding that ensuring non-proliferation while ignoring disarmament was counterproductive and unsustainable.  Nor should non-proliferation policies undermine the inalienable right of States to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes or define their national energy policies. Indeed  said Mexico’s representative on behalf of the New Agenda Coalition  an ever-growing body of research made it clearer than ever that the risk of detonation was greater than had previously been perceived.  There was a growing gap between the increased understanding of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons and the slow pace of progress towards nuclear disarmament  he said  stressing that it was time for the world community to translate words into action. Underlining the multiple global challenges confronting the global community  the representative of Philippines  on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  said while those disarmament efforts were already extremely difficult in “normal times”  that was even truer in times of crisis.  Nonetheless  the international community must not shift its attention away from the immediate task at hand  namely  the total and complete elimination of all nuclear weapons.  That was as relevant today as it was more than four decades ago  he added. To those who questioned United States support for nuclear disarmament  said its representative  “this is a mistake”.  She reiterated United States firm commitment to the NPT’s article VI and to achieving the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.  The United States was ready  she said  to discuss further nuclear reductions with the Russian Federation  but progress would require a willing partner and a good environment. The representative of India said his country  as a nuclear-weapon State  was committed to universal  non-discriminatory and verifiable nuclear disarmament.  India’s nuclear doctrine continued to stress a policy of credible minimum deterrence with a posture of no-first-use and non-use against non-nuclear weapon States.  In that respect  India remained committed to maintaining a unilateral and voluntary moratorium on nuclear explosive testing  the delegate said. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  said the representative of Trinidad and Tobago  viewed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as the “last and most visible barrier” against nuclear-weapon tests.  Moreover  the Community advocated for multilateral cooperation in non-proliferation  as outlined in Security Council resolution 1540 (2004). Speaking on behalf of the Arab Group  the representative of Egypt said that the goals of disarmament and global security could “never be realized in the presence of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction”  or until those efforts were redirected towards development.  On that note  the Group rejected military doctrines that allowed for the use of nuclear weapons and called for the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. The representative of the European Union delegation welcomed the coming entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty and highlighted the importance of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) in motivating nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  Towards that end  he said the Treaty’s entry into force and universalization remained top priorities for the Union. Speaking on behalf of the African Group  the representative of Nigeria expressed the continent’s deep concerns about the illicit trade and circulation of small arms and light weapons  underscoring the grave consequences of their spread and accumulation around the world  particularly in Africa. The representative of Mexico also spoke in his national capacity. Syria’s representative spoke in exercise of the right of reply. The Committee will meet again at 10 a.m.  8 October  to continue its debate. Background The First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) met this morning to begin its annual general debate  scheduled to run through 15 October  on all disarmament and international security agenda items entrusted to it  for which it had before it the following reports:  A/69/135  A/69/135/Add.1  A/69/112  A/69/112/Add.1  A/69/130 (Part I) and A/69/130 (Part I)/Add.1  A/69/124  A/69/124/Add.1  A/69/123  A/69/151  A/69/113  A/69/113/Add.1  A/69/132  A/69/140  A/69/173  A/69/172  A/69/172/Add.1  A/69/114  A/69/114/Add.1  A/69/115  A/69/152  A/69/118  A/69/118/Add.1  A/69/131  A/69/131/Add.1  A/69/138  A/69/138/Add.1  A/69/154  A/69/154/Add.1  A/69/116  A/69/139  A/69/134  A/69/168  A/69/127  A/69/136  A/69/133  A/69/361  A/69/176  A/69/208  A/69/27  A/69/42  A/69/169 and A/69/137. Opening Remarks COURTENAY RATTRAY of Jamaica  Committee Chair  expressed his wish that members approach the agenda with a sincere desire to create conditions within which “global peace can reign and our collective security can be assured”.  Even as they asserted the primacy of their respective interests  the tradition would continue of engaging with each other in an atmosphere of respect.  It was an important juncture in history  he stated  one in which the world benefited from commercial relations from technological advances  and yet was confronted by emerging weapons technologies that posed risks to international peace and security. At the same time  he highlighted the “dangerous intersection” between the activities of transnational criminal organizations  terrorist groups  State and non-State informal actors and violent extremists which had access to instruments of war.  Those fuelled instability and harmed civilians  particularly women and children.  On that note  the Chairman said he was mindful of the responsibility of the Committee to help to create an international framework within which deadly weapons of war could either be completely eliminated or placed within regulatory constraints that ensured they were not misused.  He would do his utmost to ensure that the conduct of the deliberations did justice to those important issues. ANGELA KANE  High Representative for Disarmament Affairs  said that disarmament had long been the world’s collective agenda.  However  there was a secondary theme that characterized the United Nations work  namely  disagreements over the means by which to achieve such goals.  In the face of those disagreements  Member States had proposed different ways to revitalize the disarmament machinery  which could produce concrete and substantive results  as evidenced by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and of Their Destruction (Chemical Weapons Convention)  and the Arms Trade Treaty.  Those who believed that progress in arms control was impossible in times of ongoing disputes needed only to recall the number of treaties in those fields that were concluded precisely during unsettled times. Perhaps  she continued  progress would be made this year in the impasse characterizing the disarmament machinery.  The collective mission was to focus on disarmament itself and not on results-based disarmament measures  which only derailed efforts.  Those measures  she added  were valuable in their close connection to the First Committee’s mandate.  The Committee must not simply reaffirm  as it did each year  its long-term goals  but must maintain a process for ensuring the implementation of existing commitments through concrete actions.  That was especially true with regard to nuclear disarmament  which continued to lack specific benchmarks.  The absence of a results-based approach hindered the effectiveness of the machinery.  Disarmament and non-proliferation had an important impact on the wider goals of the United Nations  she added. Reducing military expenditures allowed for a diversion of funds towards human needs and the advancement of humanitarian goals  she said.  The most alarming headlines of the day did not deal with the fearsome prospects of nuclear war  but instead told of armed conflicts raging inside States  often involving non-State actors armed to the teeth with some of the most lethal small weapons ever developed  including tanks  mortars and other equipment  which they did not manufacture themselves.  That was the context in which the Committee would commence its substantive work in 2014.  If the Committee recognized that flexibility was not weakness and if it could build mutual trust and confidence  it would have an opportunity to move forward towards achieving its goals. Statements DESRA PERCAYA (Indonesia)  speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  said that the disarmament and international security environment remained at an impasse.  Regardless of long-standing calls for the total elimination of nuclear weapons  concrete steps remained elusive.  The Movement reaffirmed its principle positions on nuclear disarmament and stressed that efforts aimed at nuclear non-proliferation should be done in parallel.  Some nuclear-weapon States justified the use or threat of use of those weapons  but that could not be justified on any grounds.  Compliance by the nuclear-weapon States with their obligations under the NPT was imperative and must not be delayed further. The Movement  he noted  would introduce during the current session an updated version of General Assembly resolution 68/32 on follow-up to the high-level meeting on nuclear disarmament.  The group had also initiated a “Day”  to be observed on 26 September  in observance of the elimination of nuclear weapons.  He reiterated deep concern over that “greatest threat to peace” — the retention of those weapons  as enshrined in the doctrines of nuclear-weapon States and that of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  Those texts set out rationales for the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.  He welcomed the growing focus on the humanitarian consequence of those weapons  and reaffirmed that only the total elimination of nuclear weapons would guarantee their non-use. He stressed that ensuring non-proliferation while ignoring disarmament was counterproductive and unsustainable.  Additionally  non-proliferation policies should not undermine the inalienable right of States to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes  and in that  their sovereign right to define their own national energy policies.  The primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament rested with individual States  and any multilateral norms or guidelines should be pursued within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  He demanded that Israel renounce any possession of nuclear weapons  and that it accede to the NPT and place all nuclear facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.  He expressed “profound disappointment” that the conference establishing in the Middle East a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction  due to be held in 2012  had still not taken place. He stressed the significance of achieving universal adherence to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  including by all nuclear-weapon States.  Regarding the Chemical Weapons Convention  he called on possessor States to ensure the complete destruction of their remaining programmes within the final extended deadline.  The absence of a verification system for the Biological Weapons Convention continued to challenge its effectiveness.  Concerning all disarmament measures  the exercise of political will by all States was necessary to achieving concrete results.  With political courage and collective action  the Committee could contribute tangibly towards a more secure world. JORGE LOMONACO TONDA (Mexico)  speaking on behalf of the New Agenda Coalition  said it was very evident to the group that as long as nuclear weapons existed  the possibility of a detonation remained.  The only guarantee against that occurrence was the complete elimination of those weapons.  The conference held in his country earlier this year deepened the coalition’s understanding of the long-term and global effects of nuclear weapons  and an ever-growing body of research made it clearer than ever that the risk of detonation was far greater than had previously been perceived.  The coalition welcomed the announcement by Austria to convene a third such conference later this year  he said. The desire for progress on nuclear disarmament had heightened public opinion around the world about the threat of those weapons  he said  stressing it was “high time” for the international community to translate words into action.  There was a growing gap between the increased understanding of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons and the slow pace of progress towards nuclear disarmament.  Despite some optimism  the coalition was disappointed at the absence of a conference on a Middle East nuclear-weapon-free zone.  On that issue  it was imperative to implement the resolution adopted at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference.  He added that  in a world where the basic needs of billions were not being met  the growth in nuclear weapons expenditures was “unacceptable and unsustainable”.  He urged Governments to direct those much-needed resources towards socioeconomic development. The reports presented by the nuclear-weapon States to the third session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2015 NPT Review Conference  he said  revealed a continued reliance by those States on nuclear weapons.  There had been no further reductions in the global stockpile  or any significant doctrinal changes that would provide evidence of concrete nuclear disarmament progress to which the nuclear-weapon States recommitted in 2010.  While the Movement welcomes the increased transparency of some nuclear-weapon States  the primary goal of their reports should have been to measure progress.  The coalition looked forward to implementation by those States of their nuclear commitments in a manner that enabled NPT States parties to regularly monitor progress and recommend a detailed reporting format that would enhance confidence and trust.  To kick-start the process towards implementation of action 5 of the 2010 NPT Action Plan  the coalition had presented a working paper to the Preparatory Committee’s third session  debate on which must inform the next steps.  A successful outcome next year would require more than a simple rollover of the 2010 Action Plan. JACEK BYLICA  representative of the European Union delegation  welcomed the coming entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty  which represented a major success for effective multilateralism.  That treaty would significantly contribute to international peace and security by establishing robust and effective common global standards for the regulation of the international conventional weapons trade.  Once it entered force  the Treaty’s effective implementation and universalization would be essential for its success and relevance.  All European Union countries were signatories  and so far  23 of them had ratified  with the remaining ratifications expected shortly. He said the CTBT was crucial to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation  and its entry into force and universalization remained top priorities for the European Union.  Pending its entry into force  all States  including the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  should abide by a moratorium on nuclear-weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosion  and to refrain from any action that would defeat the Treaty’s object and purpose.  He strongly condemned the violation of several commitments by the Russian Federation to refrain from the threat or use of force against Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty under the Budapest memorandum of 1994  which concerned security assurances in connection with Ukraine’s accession to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon State. The European Union  he noted  had condemned in the strongest possible terms the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea nuclear test of February 2013  as well as that country’s threat of another test.  It had urged the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to refrain from further provocative actions.  It also supported the ongoing diplomatic efforts  led by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy  to seek a diplomatic solution with Iran on the country’s nuclear issue.  He welcomed the Joint Plan of Action between Iran and the “E3+3”  the framework for cooperation between Iran and the IAEA  and that country’s continued implementation of measures under the joint action plan. He said the Union stood united in condemning in the strongest terms all use of chemical weapons in Syria  which constituted an international law violation  a war crime  and a crime against humanity.  There could be no impunity  and perpetrators of the attacks must be held accountable.  The international community had cooperated effectively over the past year to destroy Syria’s chemical weapons stockpile  but work remained.  Syria must ensure the complete and irreversible dismantlement of its chemical weapons programme  including production facilities. U. JOY OGWU (Nigeria)  speaking on behalf of the African Group  said it fully supported implementation of the resolution on the follow-up to the 2013 high-level meeting of the General Assembly  including the call for negotiations on the early conclusion of a comprehensive convention on nuclear weapons.  It underscored the “absolute validity” of multilateral diplomacy in the field of disarmament  non-proliferation and international security  restating that there were no substitutes for that approach in addressing global disarmament issues in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. Africa  she went on  supported the principle of complete nuclear disarmament  as the prerequisite for maintaining international peace and security.  She recalled the entry into force of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of Pelindaba)  which reaffirmed the continent’s status as nuclear-weapon- free  thereby preventing the stationing of nuclear explosive devices on the territory and prohibiting those weapons’ tests.  In that context  the African Group strongly supported the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and was deeply concerned that the commitments made at the 2010 NPT Review Conference in that regard had not been implemented.  Continued delay also ran contrary to the spirit of the 1995 NPT resolution on the Middle East  she noted  urging Israel’s accession to the NPT as a non-nuclear party to bring all its nuclear facilities under IAEA comprehensive safeguards. Regarding the Test-Ban Treaty  the African Group  she said  stressed the importance of its universal adherence and noted the special responsibilities in that regard of the nuclear-weapon States.  Upon its entry into force  the CTBT would assist in halting the future development or proliferation of nuclear weapons.  As such  the Group encouraged the remaining “Annex II” States as well as those yet to accede to the NPT  to sign and ratify the CTBT without further delay.  Describing the NPT as the “cornerstone of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation”  the Group reiterated the need for all States to abide by the spirit of the Treaty and to work towards fulfilling its three pillars:  nuclear disarmament  non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  She also raised the continent’s deep concerns about the illicit trade and circulation of small arms and light weapons.  Their accumulation and spread around the world  particularly in Africa  continued to emphasize the need for the balanced  full and effective implementation of the second Review Conference of the United Nations Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons.  The Group welcomed the convening of the Fifth Biennial Meeting of States this year and stressed that international cooperation and assistance was essential to the Action Programme’s full implementation. AMR ABDELLATIF ABOULATTA (Egypt)  speaking on behalf of the Arab Group and associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said the goals of disarmament and global security could never be realized in the presence of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction  or until those efforts were redirected towards development.  The Group rejected military doctrines that allowed for the use of nuclear weapons  and called for the universality of the NPT.  It also continued to call for the establishment of a zone free of nuclear and mass destruction weapons in the Middle East.  However  Israel refused to adhere to the NPT or subject its nuclear systems to the IAEA  remaining the only State in the region to refrain from doing so.  The establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East was a pillar of the NPT and was no less important than the others.  However  he was disappointed at the delay  since 2012  of a conference to create such a zone  owing to Israel’s refusal to submit to the will of the international community. Reiterating the importance of the Conference on Disarmament  he said the Arab Group was concerned at the impasse  which  it felt  was not a result of Conference shortcomings  but of the absence of political will.  The Group also believed that outer space must be used for peaceful purposes and that its militarization must be restricted.  The current international legal instruments that dealt with that matter were insufficient and he thus called for the establishment of a committee within the Conference on Disarmament to deal with that issue and produce a multilateral agreement.  On conventional weapons  he urged solidarity in review conferences aimed at implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action.  The international community must not slacken in its ambitions  but must abide by the rules and principles of international peace and security to achieve progress in all disarmament issues. LIBRAN N. CABACTULAN (Philippines)  speaking on behalf ASEAN  said the member States were unwavering in their commitment to ridding the world of nuclear weapons.  Yet 40 years into the collective efforts towards realizing that goal  the global stockpiles remained at alarmingly high levels.  The Association strongly supported substantive and robust discussions on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons  with the aim of providing a comprehensive understanding of the catastrophic effects of those weapons  both on human beings and the environment.  He welcomed the conferences on the humanitarian impact of those weapons held in Oslo and Nayarit  and looked forward to a more substantive outcome in the upcoming meeting in Vienna. He reaffirmed the Association States’ commitment to preserve Southeast Asia as a zone free of both nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction.  Those States underlined the importance of peace  security and stability in the Korean Peninsula  and supported all efforts to achieve its denuclearization  including by creating a conducive environment for the early resumption of the six-party talks.  The Association was concerned at the recent rise of violence committed by terrorist and extremist organizations  he said  adding that with the persistent threat of global terrorism  it was more vital than ever to ensure that extremist movements did not gain access to weapons of mass destruction. With only six months left before the next NPT Review Conference  he was concerned that the international community had fallen behind in its commitments agreed at the 2010 Conference  such as by failing to convene a conference on the Middle East.  He called for the full implementation of the 64-point Action Plan  and the implementation of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East.  Recognizing the central role of the IAEA in nuclear non-proliferation and the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy  the Association had agreed to explore ways to formalize relations between itself and the Agency.  It was often said that disarmament efforts were already extremely difficult in “normal times”; that was even truer in times of crisis.  The world community must not allow the multiple global crises it now faced to shift attention and focus away from the immediate task at hand  which was the total and complete elimination of all nuclear weapons. That job was as relevant today was it was more than four decades ago. EDEN CHARLES (Trinidad and Tobago)  speaking on behalf CARICOM and associating with the Non-Aligned Movement  said that the Community remained firm in its conviction that the Arms Trade Treaty could contribute significantly to reducing the suffering of people around the world  particularly women and children living under the devastating impact of conventional weapons’ unregulated trade.  The Caribbean Community  after the European Union  was the regional grouping with the most Arms Trade Treaty ratifications.  Trinidad and Tobago had put forth a bid to host the Treaty secretariat headquarters  which would be a significant development as the illicit small arms and light weapons trade had disproportionately affected the region.  It would also reinforce the principle of equitable geographic distribution in the hosting of major global institutions. On nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation  he said that CARICOM was proud to be the first densely populated region in the world to have declared itself a nuclear-weapon-free zone.  It advocated for multilateral cooperation in non-proliferation and the promotion of international cooperation for peaceful purposes  as contemplated in Security Council resolution 1540 (2004).  The Community also encouraged the States to honour their NPT obligations.  It viewed the CTBT as a complementary instrument as it provided the “last and most visible barrier” against nuclear-weapon tests.  In that connection  it urged ratification by the remaining Annex 2 countries to enable the Treaty’s early entry into force. He said that any discourse on the topic  however  would be incomplete without discussing the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons  which was embodied in the outcome of the 2010 NPT Review Conference.  The Caribbean Community welcomes the growing global attention to that matter  including the upcoming meeting to be held in December this year in Austria  which would be another opportunity for Governments and civil society to deliberate measures geared towards banning nuclear weapons.  The Caribbean Community had hosted a regional meeting in August in Jamaica aimed at advancing the discourse on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons. JORGE LOMONACO TONDA (Mexico)  speaking in his national capacity  expressed strong support for the deadline of 2025 for the elimination of landmines.  He noted the convergence of positions within the international community and encouraged Members to build on that momentum towards achieving that objective.  Successful international cooperation in that regard could serve as an example for progress on other issues on the disarmament agenda.  He applauded the Arms Trade Treaty as an unprecedented milestone that demonstrated the collective will to establish a legal framework of responsibility.  The Arms Trade Treaty would also lay the groundwork for dealing with similar issues being tackled by the Committee  he said  noting his country’s role as host in 2015 of the first Conference of States Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty  stating that this forum would help promote responsible trade in weapons and the prevention of their illegal use. It was unacceptable that there were 16 000 nuclear weapons in the world  he said  adding that it was wrong for nuclear-weapon States to believe that their national security was more important than the security of the entire planet.  Complacency in certain areas had entrenched the Conference of Disarmament in a state of paralysis  he said  stressing the urgency of measuring the effects of nuclear weapons in modern society  and not in cold-war paradigms.  In addition  it was important to consider the social and development implications of a nuclear detonation.  He commended the increasing awareness of the issue  but at the same time  stressed that nuclear weapons should not be used by any actor  under any circumstances.  That should be considered a war crime  he said  adding that since they remained the only weapons of mass destruction that had not been outlawed  “we must leverage the First Committee” to finds points of convergence in that area. ROSE E. GOTTEMOELLER (United States) said that safety and security for generations to come could only be achieved by continuing the committed and serious work to reduce the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction.  That was what motivated and guided her country’s policy and was the sentiment behind President Barack Obama’s 2009 speech in Prague.  Today’s challenges should be viewed as a potent reminder that the work at hand was more important than ever.  First and foremost  the international community must provide unyielding support for the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime  the NPT.  It was a priority of her country to achieve a successful “RevCon” in 2015. Some questioned United States support for nuclear disarmament  she said. This was a mistake.  Her country remained firmly committed to the NPT’s article VI and to achieving the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.  The United States had made clear its readiness to discuss further nuclear reductions with the Russian Federation  but progress required a willing partner and a good environment.  The United States would continue to make it clear that arms control regimes and their corresponding nuclear reductions had served the world well for more than 40 years.  The United States and the Russian Federation had special responsibilities to protect and preserve those regimes  as those countries still possessed over 90 per cent of the global nuclear stockpile. Now was the time to move forward and not fall back on postures reminiscent of the cold war  she said.  Despite challenges  the United States and the Russian Federation continued to implement the Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms successfully.  When implementation was complete  deployed nuclear weapons would be at their lowest levels since the 1950s.  That translated to an 85 per cent reduction of the United States nuclear stockpile from its cold-war peak  which represented indisputable progress.  As further reductions were considered  the focus should be on responsible measures that could be trusted and verified. “There is no way to skip to the end and forego the hard work of preparing for the technical and political disarmament challenge that lie ahead ” she said.  Verification would become increasingly complex at lower numbers of nuclear weapons  while requirements of effectiveness would increase.  Every nation should be devoting ample time and energy to addressing that challenge right now.  Patience and persistence was needed from all parties  both among and beyond the “P5”.  As the 2015 NPT Review Conference approached  the United States would focus its efforts on legally binding assurances against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in the context of nuclear-weapon-free zone treaty protocols  and on ensuring that Iran’s nuclear programme was exclusively peaceful.  The United States was eager to launch negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty  which  she said  was a vital and necessary step in multilateral nuclear disarmament. D.B. VENKATESH VARMA (India) said that  as a nuclear-weapon State  his country’s commitment to universal  non-discriminatory and verifiable nuclear disarmament remained undiminished.  That goal could be achieved through a step by step process underwritten by a universal commitment and an agreed multilateral framework that was global and non-discriminatory.  All States possessing nuclear weapons could make a contribution by engaging in a meaningful dialogue to build trust and confidence  and by reducing the salience of nuclear weapons in international affairs and security doctrines.  In the current circumstances  the role of such steps in enhancing strategic trust globally could not be overestimated. As a responsible nuclear Power  India’s nuclear doctrine continued to stress a policy of credible minimum deterrence with a posture of no-first-use and non-use against non-nuclear-weapon States  he said  noting the country’s continued commitment to maintaining a unilateral and voluntary moratorium on nuclear explosive testing.  In July  his country had ratified the IAEA Additional Protocol  which it had signed in 2009  and had contributed to international efforts to advancing global non-proliferation goals and objectives.  As a major space-faring nation  India had vital developmental and security interests in space and supported strengthening the international legal regime to preserve it for peaceful uses.  As in previous years  India would be tabling three draft resolutions  namely “Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons”  “Reducing Nuclear Danger”  and “Measures to Prevent Terrorists from Acquiring Weapons of Mass Destruction”.  It would also introduce a draft decision on the “Role of Science and Technology in the context of International Security and Disarmament”  he added. Right of Reply Speaking in exercise of the right of reply  the representative of Syria said that year after year and session after session  the European Union repeated the same baseless allegations by highlighting Syria’s so-called non-compliance with the IAEA and an alleged nuclear programme.  However  the European Union  by presenting those claims  was turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to the only nuclear weapons programme in the Middle East  namely  that of Israel.  He reiterated his condemnation of the use of chemical weapons  and stressed that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS) possessed those weapons and was using them — a fact his country had been repeating since 2012 and which it had warned the United Nations Secretary-General and the Security Council about.  Those accusing Syria did not realize that his country had fulfilled its obligations despite the prevailing difficult situation.  Many United Nations officials talked about Syria’s cooperation and completion of its unprecedented work within the framework of Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-07,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaspd554.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Decolonization had been one of the “most defining issues” of the latter part of the twentieth century and beyond owing to the United Nations’ “untiring” efforts  but with 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories still on the Organization’s list  the Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) today heard calls for completing the process through a common endeavour in the spirit of cooperation among all parties involved. Committee Chair Durga Prasad Bhattarai (Nepal) made an appeal for a sustained joint effort  as he opened the annual debate on the subject  during which he emphasized the role of the Special Committee on Decolonization in ensuring the emergence of dozens of sovereign and independent States over the past decades.  Despite those gains  he added  the task was far from complete. Presenting the Report of the Special Committee on the Situation with Regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to colonial Countries and Peoples  Rapporteur Bashar Ja’afari (Syria) provided an account of various aspects of the Committee’s work  including those relating to the Non-Self-Governing Territories within its purview.  He said that  during the substantive session held earlier in the year  the Committee had considered the items on the agenda in the context of the third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism and provided recommendations on ways of moving forward. Surveying the Special Committee’s achievements and challenges  its Chair  Xavier Lasso Mendoza (Ecuador) called for sustained efforts to further the new dynamics in the Committee  including through the process of informal consultations among the Bureau  administering Powers and Non-Self-Governing Territories. He emphasized the need to update the resolution on the question of French Polynesia to include information on the environmental  ecological  health and other impacts of the 30-year period of nuclear testing there.  Noting that petitioners from the territories would soon have an opportunity to express their views  he underscored the importance of cross-cutting issues such as climate change and the role of regional organizations. On the question of the Malvinas Islands (Falklands)*  the representative of Costa Rica  speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  reaffirmed the group’s support for Argentina’s rights and called on both Argentina and the United Kingdom to refrain from unilateral measures while seeking a solution to what he called an “anachronistic situation”. Speaking on behalf of the Union of South American Nations  the representative of Suriname expressed support for the work and activities of the Special Committee  including in connection with the “special and particular” situations involving sovereignty disputes.  He urged Argentina and the United Kingdom to resume bilateral negotiations on the Malvinas as soon as possible. The representative of Argentina emphasized that the Malvinas  South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands were recognized as a “special and particular” situation that must be resolved between his country and the United Kingdom.  Stressing that British military and commercial activities in the area created unnecessary tensions  she said Argentina was waiting for the United Kingdom to come to the negotiating table. On Western Sahara  speakers stressed the need for a lasting and fair settlement in line with United Nations resolutions and with an emphasis on monitoring the human rights situation. The representative of Iran  speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  urged all administering Powers to pay full compensation for the economic  social and cultural consequences of their occupation.  He also supported the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the establishment of an independent State. Before concluding the meeting  the Chair announced the granting of requests for hearings by petitioners on French Polynesia  Gibraltar  New Caledonia and Western Sahara  to be held from 8 to 10 October. Also speaking in today’s debate were representatives of Guatemala  Uruguay  Mexico  Brazil  El Salvador  Venezuela  Ecuador  China and Turkey. Representatives of the United Kingdom  Morocco Argentina and Algeria spoke in exercise of the right of reply. The Fourth Committee will meet again at 3 p.m. on Wednesday  8 October  to continue its debate on decolonization issues. Background As it began its annual general debate on all decolonization items this afternoon  the Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) had before it item 55 (documents A/69/23  chapters VII and XIII  and A/69/69);item 56 (document A/69/23  chapters V and XIII); item 57 (documents A/69/23  chapters VI and XIII  and A/69/66); item 58 (document A/69/67) and item 59 (documents A/69/23 chapters VIII  IX  X  XI and XIII  and A/69/189).  Also before the Committee were requests for hearings (documents A/C.4/69/2  A/C.4/69/3  A/C.4/69/4 and A/C.4/69/5). Introduction of Report BASHAR JA’AFARI (Syria) presented a report (document A/69/23) containing detailed accounts of various aspects of the Committee’s work  including those relating to the various Non-Self-Governing Territories within its purview.  He said that  during the substantive session held earlier in the year  the Committee considered the items on the agenda in the context of the third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism and provided recommendations on ways of moving forward. Recalling the General Assembly’s affirmation of French Polynesia’s right to self-determination  he highlighted the Committee’s work relating to the amelioration of the environmental and health impacts of 30 years of nuclear testing there.  He thanked members of the Fourth Committee  as well as the Secretary-General for their support for the Special Committee’s work. Statements GHOLAMHOSSEIN DEHGHANI (Iran)  speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  said that the Movement attached great importance to decolonization and the right of peoples to self-determination.  He affirmed full support for the peoples under colonial rules.  Noting that the Special Committee still had 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories on its agenda  he stressed the need to expedite the eradication of colonialism. The Non-Aligned Movement reiterated its full support to the decolonization process and its pertinent bodies  he said  calling for enhancement of their efficiency so as to improve cooperation with administering Powers and to ensure the active participation of peoples of the territories.  He urged all administering Powers to pay full compensations for the economic  social and cultural consequences of their occupation.  In addition  he reaffirmed the rights of the people of Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence and stressed that the Movement continued to support the inalienable right of Palestinian people to self-determination and establishment of their independent State. XAVIER LASSO MENDOZA (Ecuador)  surveying the Committee’s achievements and challenges  said the Committee had been strengthened with the addition of a third vice-chairman.  He called for sustained efforts to push forward the new dynamics in the Committee  including through the process of informal consultations among the Bureau  administering Powers and Non-Self-Governing Territories. He emphasized the need to update resolution V on the question of French Polynesia to include information on the environmental  ecological  health and other impacts of the 30-year period of nuclear testing there as contained the Secretary-General’s report.  Noting that petitioners from the territories would have an opportunity to express their views soon  he underscored the importance of cross-cutting issues such as climate change and the role of regional organizations. JUAN CARLOS MENDOZA-GARCÍA (Costa Rica)  speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  reiterated the organization’s firm support to the process of decolonization  as well as to the right of self-determination.  The process of decolonization had been one of the greatest successes of the United Nations  but the existence of 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories meant the international community still must shoulder its responsibility.  He urged the administering Powers to take into account the specific situation of each territory in moving them forward through the decolonization process.  The CELAC summit earlier in the year reaffirmed the region’s commitment to freeing itself from colonialism  he stressed. He supported  in addition  the dissemination of information on decolonization by the Department of Public Information.  He also reaffirmed CELAC’s support for the rights of Argentina in the Malvinas dispute  calling on Britain and Argentina to seek a peaceful settlement in line with resolutions of the United Nations and regional organizations  and to refrain from unilateral measures while seeking a solution to what he called an “anachronistic situation”.  Consideration of Puerto Rico should take into account all its dimensions  including the Latin American and Caribbean character of the territory.  Consideration of the situation of island territories should take into account  in addition  rising sea levels and other current threats.  Finally  he said that CELAC supported the Secretary-General’s pursuit of a just and lasting settlement for Western Sahara. KITTY SWEEB (Suriname)  speaking on behalf of the Union of South American Nations  described colonialism as a violation of the fundamental tenets of democracy and freedom whose existence impeded international economic cooperation and the development of dependent peoples.  It also went against the United Nations’ ideals of universal peace. Stating that the decolonization process required continued efforts to bring an end to colonialism  she pledged the Union’s support for the work and activities of the Special Committee to advance decolonization  including the “special and particular” situations involving sovereignty disputes. The question of the Malvinas Islands had historic and legal circumstances that excluded the possibility of solving it under the exercise of the principle of self-determination  she said  calling upon Argentina and the United Kingdom to resume bilateral negotiations as soon as possible.  Supporting Argentina’s legitimate sovereignty rights over the Malvinas Islands and its continuous constructive attitude towards a definitive solution  she said the military presence of the United Kingdom in the area and the unilateral exploration and exploitation of natural resources was contrary to the search for a peaceful settlement. MÓNICA BOLAÑOS PÉREZ (Guatemala)  associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and CELAC  said the Malvinas dispute  which had specific features of colonization recognized by the United Nations  required the resumption of bilateral relations between Argentina and the United Kingdom to ensure a fair and lasting settlement.  Argentina had expressed its commitment to that end  she recalled  expressing hope that the United Kingdom would do the same. Guatemala supported all resolutions on the Western Sahara  she said  reaffirming her Government’s support for the Secretary-General’s current efforts.  A settlement would ensure the security and stability of the wider region. GONZALO KONCKE (Uruguay)  associating himself with the statements of the Union of South American Nations and CELAC  reaffirmed the collective commitment to redouble the efforts to bring about decolonization and forge discussion between Non-Self-Governing Territories and administering Powers. On the question of Western Sahara  he said it was crucial to resume conversation and respect the right of self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.  The issue was a priority for Uruguay  which urged the parties to cooperate with the United Nations to further respect human rights in Western Sahara. Regarding the Malvinas Islands  he said that the current population of the Islands had come from the colonial homeland  Argentina.  Uruguay supported Argentina’s legitimate right to sovereignty over the Malvinas  South Sandwich and South Georgia Islands.  That was a very particular situation  which required a peaceful and negotiated solution between the parties.  Uruguay urged the speedy resumption of negotiations towards a fair and peaceful solution.  He said the MERCOSUR supported Argentina’s fair and well-founded claim  and its leaders reaffirmed that country’s legitimate right in that long-standing dispute. RICARDO ALDAY GONZÁLEZ (Mexico) said the right to self-determination was enshrined in the United Nations Charter and was a guiding principle of his country.  He reiterated the need for United Nations to remain engaged in the process of decolonization  especially within the framework of the third Decade. On Western Sahara  he stressed the need for a lasting and fair settlement in line with United Nations resolutions.  Mexico agreed with the importance of monitoring the human rights situation  he said  adding that lasting peace should include a referendum comprising all the options necessary towards that end. On the Malvinas Islands  he expressed support for Argentina’s historical and legal claims  and stressed the urgency of a negotiated settlement in accordance with United Nations resolutions  as well as those of regional organizations. ANTONIO DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil)  associating himself with CELAC  the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) and the Union of South American Nations  said the Malvinas dispute represented “unfinished business” of the United Nations.  Brazil called on both parties to engage in dialogue in keeping with the primacy of rule of law  he said  urging the United Kingdom to refrain from “illegitimate” exploitation of hydrocarbons and other resources in the area.  Additionally  the United Kingdom’s military activities there contradicted the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes.  The desire for a peaceful settlement of the Malvinas dispute was shared by developing countries across the globe  which  he said  underscored the urgency of a solution. MARÍA CRISTINA PERCEVAL (Argentina) associated herself with all of those who supported the process of decolonization and proclaimed the need to put an end to colonialism in all its forms  through self-determination and territorial integrity.  She expressed Argentina’s support for the right to self-determination and insisted that no people should be living under foreign occupation  as that would deny them that basic human right.  Argentina reiterated its support for the Special Committee on Decolonization  stating that people were entitled to freely decide their political future.  She could not tolerate the use of the self-determination principle to justify the continuation of sovereignty disputes  which hurt Argentina’s territorial integrity  since the British occupation in 1883. Regarding the Malvinas  South Sandwich and the South Georgia Islands  she said that the matter had been recognized as a special and particular situation that must be resolved only between the two parties — bearing in mind the best interests of the people of those Islands.  She said there were no colonialized people in the Malvinas  but a special colonization situation resulted in the sovereignty dispute.  Her Government believed that any attempt to authorize the British population on the Island to become the “referee” of the dispute would invalidate the principle of self-determination  precisely because there were no people under colonial rule.  According to Argentina  the people were British subjects for whom the situation had not changed over the years.  On the other hand  Argentines from the country’s mainland could not settle in the Malvinas  with a few exceptions. The United Nations  she stressed  recognized that the right of self-determination did not apply to that situation.  Indeed  the United Nations had asked that the sovereignty dispute be settled through negotiation; however  the United Kingdom refused to respect the mandates of the international community.  She added that the United Kingdom pursued illegal activities  namely  the exploitation of renewable and non-renewable resources.  It also conducted military exercises.  She insisted that those British activities created unnecessary tensions and conflicts  which was “a slap” on Argentina and the other countries in the region.  That gave the dispute a regional dimension. She emphasized that it has been nearly half a century since the United Nations had been urging a peaceful solution through direct negotiation between the two Governments concerned.  She said that Argentina had been sitting at the negotiation table for many years and was waiting for the United Kingdom to do the same.  The representative of Argentina reaffirmed her decision to find a peaceful solution through dialogue with the United Kingdom. RUBÉN IGNACIO ZAMORA RIVAS (El Salvador)  associating himself with CELAC  reaffirmed his Government’s support for Argentina’s legitimate rights to the Malvinas Islands.  Calling for a settlement based on the principles of justice and international law  he urged Argentina and the United Kingdom to seek a peaceful settlement to their sovereignty dispute. In the case of Western Sahara  he stressed the need for a fair and lasting solution through dialogue that respected the human rights of the people.  Welcoming efforts to create a conducive atmosphere for peace  he related his own country’s emergence from conflict through similar endeavours to institute durable democratic and participatory institutions. HENRY ALFREDO SUÁREZ MORENO (Venezuela)  associating with the statements of CELAC  Suriname and Iran  said that  despite the progress made in decolonization  there remained many colonial situations  which ran contrary to international law.  He recommended that Member States mobilize their efforts to help the people in the 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories realize their aspirations of independence and freedom. He expressed Venezuela’s support for the right of self-determination of the people of Puerto Rico  whose fight for independence was a “dear” cause for Latin America and the Caribbean.  He demanded an end to the United States’ colonization  and called on that country to adopt the necessary measures to bring about self-determination in Puerto Rico. Regarding the question of the Malvinas  South Sandwich and South Georgia Islands  he voiced his country’s support for the sovereignty right of Argentina in line with international law.  Venezuela was committed to put an end to colonialism in all its forms and to foster negotiation between the United Kingdom and Argentina.  Venezuela supported current negotiations  as those were the only legitimate framework by which to reach a political solution that was fair  durable and accepted by all.  Finally  Venezuela urged the French Government to facilitate self-determination in French Polynesia. XAVIER LASSO MENDOZA (Ecuador)  associating with Non-Aligned Movement  CELAC and the Union of South American Nations  called for redoubled efforts to eliminate colonialism in all its manifestations.  It represented a denial of basic human rights and an impediment to international cooperation.  The Committee needed to constantly remind administering Powers of their responsibility to transmit information on the Non-Self-Governing Territories under their jurisdictions. He stressed the urgency of reaching a settlement to the Western Sahara dispute based on the wishes and aspirations of the people.  The question of Puerto Rico was of concern to Latin America and the Caribbean  and the issue must be addressed in recognition of the regional reality.  He urged the United States to ensure the full expression of the right to self-determination of the people of Puerto Rico  and called for the release of political prisoners.  The Malvinas represented a special situation that must be addressed accordingly  he said  expressing firm support for Argentina’s claims. CAROL VIVIANA ARCE ECHEVERRÍA (Costa Rica)  associating with CELAC  reiterated her country’s support for the process of decolonization  and said that a significant number of nations had attained the goal  but it was not a thing of the past  as 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories were still under colonialized rule.  She reaffirmed Costa Rica’s commitment to the mandate of the Special Committee  which had been in existence for more than 50 years.  She trusted that it would continue to seek independence for colonial countries and people.  She urged the administering Powers to transmit information to each of the Territories for which they were responsible. She reiterated Costa Rica’s support for Argentina’s position regarding the dispute  which was a special and particular colonial situation.  That dispute was a question of territorial integrity  on which a settlement would be possible with the resumption of negotiations. On the question of the Western Sahara  she expressed Costa Rica’s support for a just  durable solution that was acceptable to all parties in Western Sahara and based on the principle of international law.   She was in favour of a referendum on self-determination of the Saharan people.  She also insisted that the mandate of MINURSO be expanded to ensure respect for human rights in the Territory and in the Tindouf refugee camp. WEI ZONGLEI (China)  pledging his Government’s full support to the Committee  highlighted the achievements made by the United Nations and the Special Committee since their inception in ensuring the independence of dozens of countries.  However  he said  the “poisonous legacy” left behind by colonialism was difficult to eliminate.  He expressed hope that the Special Committee would continue building ties with the Non-Self-Governing Territories in pursuing its work. Y. HALIT ÇEVIK (Turkey) said the work of the Special Committee remained relevant and valuable in ensuring respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people in the Non-Self-Governing Territories.  Any efforts at self-determination must be generated from within and respect the wishes of the people  he said  adding that the administering Powers must safeguard their rights to social economic development. Right of Reply The representative of the United Kingdom  responding to statements made by several speakers  said his Government had no doubt about the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands.  The people of the Falklands had voted overwhelmingly to stay within the United Kingdom in a referendum in 2013  he recalled.  He regretted Argentina’s refusal to meet with the United Kingdom on the matter  and rejected claims that his country had heightened military activity in the region.  Force levels had been reduced since the conflict in the 1980s  he said  adding that people of the Falklands had made a decision to develop their own resources.  The United Kingdom urged Argentina to respect the wishes of the people of the Falklands. Also exercising his right of reply  the representative of Morocco said his Government emphasized the principle of neutrality of the United Nations  as well as the principles of predictability and transparency in the search for peace.  He rejected efforts to expand the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO)  and added that his Government remained firmly determined to implement a final settlement that enjoyed consensus.  Morocco’s commitment to human rights was recognized by the international community  and the country’s cooperation with international organizations and institutions was also exemplary.  All people living in Morocco enjoyed full human rights.  The concept and principles of self-determination had undergone an evolution  which needed to be recognized. The representative of Argentina affirmed Argentine sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands  South Georgia Islands  Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas.  He said the United Kingdom consistently distorted the reality of the situation  which  he said  stemmed from its own uncertainties over its claims.  The British “referendum” was a tautological act asking the British whether they wished to remain British.  It was imperative to resume the bilateral negotiations on sovereignty in accordance with United Nations resolutions on the matter. The representative of Algeria said Western Sahara was a Non-Self-Governing Territory  and thus  his Government was puzzled by the Moroccan representative’s effort to reinterpret the right of self-determination.  The question of Western Sahara was one of decolonization and thus should be pursued as such.  Concerning the United Nations mandate  he said the people of Western Sahara should be allowed to express their aspirations freely.  The United Nations and the international community must reactivate the referendum process forthwith. Taking the floor again in exercise of the right of reply  the representative of Morocco said the issue of referendum was overtaken by the search for a political settlement. The representative of Algeria  also taking the floor again  asserted that no country had recognized Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara.  Therefore  he urged Morocco to find a solution within the framework of international law. * A dispute exists between the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (Malvinas). Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-07,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11567.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The foundations and content of the post-2015 development agenda  and its connections to international peace and security  were debated today as the General Assembly took up the Secretary-General’s annual report card on the work of the Organization. The report took stock of progress over the past year in delivering on the eight long-term organizational priorities identified by Member States. Sam Kutesa (Uganda)  President of the General Assembly  said a nexus existed between development  peace and security.  Failure to address challenges to international peace and security would stunt progress  he warned. Some speakers called for joint action to end terrorism and armed conflicts.  Pakistan’s representative supported efforts to oppose the “reign of terror” unleashed by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS).  Pakistan would work with neighbouring Afghanistan not just to fight terrorism  but also to foster collaboration in industry  trade  infrastructure and energy  he said. Myanmar’s representative  speaking for the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  expressed deep concern over the rise of violence and brutality committed by terrorists and extremists in Iraq and Syria.  ASEAN was implementing its own Convention on Counter-Terrorism and other steps to tackle terrorism’s root causes  as well as to disrupt terrorism networks and their financing. Hearing from developed countries  as well as from the developing world  delegations including China called for international cooperation on climate change  with Cuba’s representative suggesting that for historical reasons  developed countries had a debt to developing nations  and ought to help them mitigate the consequences of the global scourge. Japan  for its part  was providing assistance to developing countries for adaptation  promoting technological innovation for energy efficiency  and contributing to a future international framework on the matter. Several countries noted the dangers of nuclear weapons  with Mongolia expressing concern over the persisting deadlock in the Conference on Disarmament  calling upon all States to take a “bold and decisive” position towards meaningful agreements on disarmament  including the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in the Middle East and North-East Asia. Also delivering statements were the representatives of Morocco  Argentina and Cameroon. Speaking in exercise of the right of reply were the representatives of India and Pakistan. Background The General Assembly met this morning to consider the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization (document A/69/1). Statements SAM KUTESA (Uganda)  President of the General Assembly  said that the report contained many issues of interest to Member States  several of which had also been emphasized by leaders during the General Debate.  Progress had been made on preparation for the Secretary-General’s Synthesis Report on the post-2015 development agenda.  But that document also highlighted that the international community was lagging behind on Millennium Development Goals involving nutrition  maternal health  education  and inequality.  As there was a nexus connecting development to peace and security  the failure to address challenges of the latter would stunt development.  The United Nations had a critical role to play in curbing the activities of non-State actors.  Huge deficits in health and education systems were exacerbating the Ebola outbreak.  The international community also had to work towards developing measures to support countries most affected by other threats to international peace  such as organized crime  drug and human trafficking and international terrorism. OMAR HILALE (Morocco) said that the great challenges facing the world today required the United Nations to adapt rapidly  in order to maintain its efficiency.  His country had deployed more than 2 000 peacekeepers to United Nations missions in Côte d’Ivoire  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  and the Central African Republic  among others.  Uneven progress had been made towards realizing the Millennium Development Goals.  Africa remained the most vulnerable continent  threatened not just by natural disasters but also poverty  famine  HIV/AIDS and now Ebola.  Terrorism and armed conflicts were also devastating  and required the international community’s joint efforts in response.  His country had launched an initiative whereby religious figures from Morocco as well as from Mali  Côte d’Ivoire  Guinea and Mauritania had met on issues related to moderate Islam.  His Government supported the creation of an independent Palestinian State living side by side with Israel.   RODOLFO REYES RODRÍGUEZ (Cuba) decried the fact that nuclear weapons continued to threaten humanity even now  25 years after the end of the Cold War.  A majority of countries were in favour of banning such weapons entirely.  While the world looked to the United Nations for guidance on the post-2015 development agenda  the severe challenge of climate change would not be met by anything other than commitment from countries themselves.  Because of colonialism  developed countries had a debt to developing nations in helping them mitigate climate change.  If military spending was reduced  needs in the fields of health  education and living conditions could be met.  The Assembly had a responsibility to mobilize to address issues identified in the Secretary-General’s report  including reform of the Security Council.  The impact and spread of Ebola in West Africa required urgent action.  He expressed hope that Cubans going to Africa would help address that situation. MASOOD KHAN (Pakistan) called for strategies to counter security threats due to trends in Ukraine  the Middle East  South Sudan and the Central African Republic  and to the unauthorized use of nuclear  radiological  biological and chemical materials.  He supported efforts to oppose the “reign of terror” unleashed by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS).  The Quartet should revive the stalled peace talks for a two-State solution.  As a top troop contributor  Pakistan had deployed more than 1 100 troops to the Central African Republic to help stabilize the situation there.  The core issue of Jammu and Kashmir must be resolved through negotiations  he said  reminding the United Nations of its responsibility in that regard.  Voicing deep concern over the recent increase in violations by Indian security forces at the India-Pakistan Line of Control and the loss of four lives yesterday  he called on the Indian Government to immediately cease fire.  Pakistan would work with Afghanistan to fight terrorism and foster collaboration in industry  trade  infrastructure and energy.  Pakistan was determined to eliminate terrorism “from our soil”  by among other things  “choking the vicious sources that feed them”.  To advance the Conference on Disarmament  the four core issues — disarmament  a fissile material treaty  prevention of arms race in outer space  and negative security assurances — must be tackled simultaneously.  World leaders’ political commitments during the recent Climate Summit must result in a global climate agreement in 2015. YOSHIFUMI OKAMURA (Japan) said his country’s response to the pressing issue of climate change included assistance to developing countries for adaptation  promoting technological innovation for energy efficiency  and contributing to a future international framework on the matter.  Japan supported the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER)  and it was providing $40 million in addition to an emergency grant of $22 million announced 3 October for the West African countries affected by the Ebola outbreak.  On United Nations reform  Japan sought to become a permanent Security Council member.  Japan would actively participate in debates on peacekeeping issues in the upcoming sessions of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations  known as the C34  and the Assembly’s Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary).  As Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission’s Working Group on Lessons Learned  Japan would issue a report by the end of the year on the challenges of drawing down or withdrawing United Nations peacekeeping missions  which he hoped would benefit the 2015 review of the Organization’s peacebuilding architecture.  The Third World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction  to be held in Sendai next March  would serve as a forum for discussing humanitarian issues and disaster prevention in an integrated way and would contribute to international cooperation on disaster risk reduction  as well as to the post-2015 development agenda. MATEO ESTREME (Argentina) welcomed the Secretary-General’s report  which provided an overview of progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.  Despite progress made  more ambitious targets were needed  something which had been discussed at the recent summit of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China and China.  The post-2015 development agenda must focus on sustainable development  a concept which included poverty eradication  social inclusion  job creation  and protection of the environment.  Another important issue was the establishment of a multilateral legal framework for restructuring sovereign debt.  The aim was to ensure that the international community could “do away with the predatory aspect of vulture funds” and ensure inclusivity and an equitable basis for the world’s peoples.  The time had come to give legal framework to this system  and the Assembly was the adequate forum to address this issue. LIU JIEYI (China) said despite progress towards peace  development  cooperation and “win-win” situations  the path of global development remained long and arduous.  He supported Iraq’s efforts to safeguard its integrity  and noted that aid was needed there to overcome instability.  A ceasefire in Syria was needed  as was a “middle-of-the-road solution”.  China firmly opposed all forms of terrorism  and supported the Council resolution to coordinate efforts to combat that scourge.  2015 would be an important year  when the international community must develop a renewed spirit to achieve its objectives  focusing on improving peoples’ well-being  enhancing inclusiveness  implementing development models  and strengthening development partnerships.  He called for international cooperation on climate change.  Recalling China’s participation at the Climate Change Summit  he noted that there was fresh political momentum to help move the world towards those goals.  China did not support an increase in the number of permanent Security Council members. U KYAW TIN (Myanmar)  speaking on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  said the Association would submit the biennial Assembly resolution entitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and ASEAN”  intended to address challenges related to sustainable development  climate change  peace and security  human rights  rule of law  disarmament and terrorism.  The upcoming Sixth ASEAN-United Nations Summit  to be held in November in Nay Pyi Taw  Myanmar  would be an effective policy tool for strengthening the partnership between the two organizations.  ASEAN was implementing a climate change initiative and an action plan.  On human rights  ASEAN had adopted a human rights declaration in 2012 and a declaration to end violence against women and children in 2013.  It was in the process of implementing the ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response  a common platform for disaster management.  Deeply concerned by the rise of violence and brutality committed by terrorists and extremists in Iraq and Syria  the Association was implementing its own Convention on Counter-Terrorism and other steps to address terrorism’s root causes  and disrupt terrorism networks and financing.  The Initiative for ASEAN Integration Work Plan II aimed to narrow the development gap among the Association’s members. OD OCH (Mongolia) said his country had already reached the Millennium targets related to infant mortality  HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis  access to water and basic sanitation  and new information and communications technology.  But important goals such as halving poverty  providing housing and ensuring environmental sustainability remained a challenge and required targeted interventions.  On climate change  Mongolia aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2030  and using coal  solar  wind  and hydropower  would hope to become the region’s port hub of renewable energy.  He expressed concern over the persisting deadlock in the Conference on Disarmament  and as co-chair with Mexico for the first part of the Conference’s 2015 meeting  he called upon all States to take a “bold and decisive” position towards meaningful agreements on disarmament  including the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in the Middle East and North-East Asia.  In its work in justice and international law  Mongolia was “poised to completely abolish the death penalty”.  It was important to resume intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform. TOMMO MONTHE (Cameroon) said that climate change was an enormous challenge facing the international community.  Everything should be done to limit the rise in temperature to 2 degrees Celsius.  The upcoming meetings in Lima and Paris would be crucial to saving the world’s common future  and the world of future generations.  He listed measures taken by Cameroon in response to the environmental challenge  such as his country’s creation of a ministry dedicated to the protection of nature and to sustainable development.  He also noted several regional conventions signed by his Government  such as the Treaty on the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Forest Ecosystems in Central Africa.  He gave details of his country’s forestry activities and initiatives  before turning to development issues.  He touched upon the dangers of terrorism and listed his country’s activities in the field of the maintenance of international peace and security. Right of Reply Speaking in exercise of the right of reply  the representative of India said that  in regard to the reference made by the representative of Pakistan  it was a matter of deep regret that Pakistan had violated the ceasefire  which had resulted in six people being killed.  Relations were being hampered  and the onus was on Pakistan.  India’s Armed Forces would respond to provocation. The representative of Pakistan  also speaking in exercise of the right of reply  said that for seven days  Indian security forces had been shelling across the Line of Control.  Yesterday had been the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha  yet still Indian forces had played havoc.  It was saddening that the Indian Government had not been able to restrain its forces  he said  calling upon the Indian Government to cease fire.  The Government of Pakistan had exercised restraint and extended a hand to India  and this unprovoked firing was a cause of deep concern.  His Government hoped the Indian side would give peace a chance. The representative of India  again speaking in exercise of the right of reply  said that India rejected all untenable and unsolicited remarks made by Pakistan. The representative of Pakistan  again speaking in exercise of the right of reply  said that a working boundary had to be preserved in the interest of people in the region  and asked for restraint from India and from security forces  as well as for the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) to be allowed to monitor the ceasefire. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-03,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaab4117.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) today adopted the work programme for its sixty-ninth session and began its examination of the Secretary-General’s budget proposal for the United Nations operation to fight the Ebola outbreak  the Organization’s first-ever emergency health mission. Opening the session  Committee Chairperson František Ružička (Slovakia) called for efficiency  transparency and inclusiveness in its work and asked delegates to shorten their statements  noting that a loss of 15 minutes in each meeting would amount to a loss of 21 hours for the entire session.  “In this time  almost 300 000 babies are born and 136 000 people die ” he said. In the ensuing discussion  several representatives cautioned against closed-door consultations in small configurations  while others requested timely issuance of documents  particularly reports on budget items  as their late availability had been detrimental to making informed decisions.       The Committee then began its substantive work by taking up the issue of resource allocation for the newly established United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) and the Office of the Special Envoy on Ebola. Presenting the Secretary-General’s preliminary funding proposal  Susana Malcorra  his Chef de Cabinet  requested approval of $49.9 million for the rest of the year.  The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) endorsed that amount and recommended that the General Assembly approve it. Several representatives argued  however  that the proposal must be revised to focus more on core activities of UNMEER  while others sought more detailed information on how the Mission would “deliver as one”.   Bolivia’s delegate  speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  said the Secretariat should provide a detailed budget and comprehensive information on the Mission’s structure and budgetary arrangements.  He would carefully examine its resource requirements  particularly for staffing.  Togo’s delegate  speaking for the African Group  said that approval of the $49.9 million would in no way mean an endorsement of the Mission’s structure set forth in the Secretary-General's report.  The current proposal must be revised to ensure an effective response to the situation on the ground  and to guarantee that resources were used for substantial activities and not top-heavy administrative structures. A representative of the European Union Delegation stressed the need for all partners to coordinate their actions and expertise  and to avoid duplication.  The Union looked forward to receiving more comprehensive information on the concept of the Mission  its relationship with other United Nations entities  operational targets and the timeline  as well as its funding requirements  structure and organization  within the context of the detailed budget to be submitted by the Secretary-General in November. Also speaking today were the representatives of Singapore (on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations)  Costa Rica (on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States)  Japan  United States  Russian Federation and the United Republic of Tanzania. The Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. on Tuesday  7 October  to consider its agenda items on the scale of assessments for the apportionment of expenses of the United Nations and on programme planning. Organization of Work SACHA SERGIO LLORENTTY SOLÍZ (Bolivia)  speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  said that the Group intended to carefully examine several items of the agenda  including the proposed programme budget outline for the biennium 2016-2017  the Capital Master Plan  the revised estimates and programme budget implications for the 2014-2015 budget cycle  the independent recosting study  the first performance report on the programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015  the scale of assessments  human resources management  and the United Nations common system.  Noting his Group's concern over the late issuance of several important reports and other documentation  he added that that affected deliberations.  The Group accepted the programme of work on the understanding that it would be reviewed and amended after the first week  as needed. KAREN TAN (Singapore)  speaking on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  said that the regional bloc would pay close attention to such agenda items as the special political missions  human resources management  and the programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015.  ASEAN would attach great importance to the discussions on the funding and backstopping of special political missions  including the creation of a separate account.  She called for timely issuance of reports  citing the Committee's heavy and complex agenda. PAULA COTO-RAMÍREZ (Costa Rica)  speaking on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  said that the Community would pay close attention to the proposals on the agenda that were of interest to its region.  She was referring in particular to the funding and backstopping of special political missions  the first performance report of the programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015  the proposed programme budget outline for the biennium 2016-2017  the Report on the activities of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS)  human resources management  the United Nations common system and the independent study on recosting. The funding and backstopping of the special political missions of the Community's region were of importance  particularly discussions on the Organization’s inadequate funding mechanisms  she said.  Measures to improve those had been recommended by the Secretariat and the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) in 2011.  The Community supported the establishment of a separate account that would be budgeted  funded and reported upon on an annual basis with a financial period of 1 July to 30 June.  Holistic reform of the special political missions was needed.  It was important to have the complete official documentation for the Committee’s consideration available in a timely manner. KODJOVI DOSSEH (Togo)  speaking on behalf of the African Group and associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  expressed concern about the delayed issuance of documents  which had become detrimental to making informed decisions.  He called for the timely issuance of reports so they could be effectively considered.  The Group looked forward to discussions  particularly on the financing of peacekeeping operations and special political missions  including the possibility of establishing a separate account for special political missions  which was long over due.  It was also interested in deliberations on the management of facilities  including those of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)  the United Nations Office in Nairobi  and the newly established United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER).  He urged for open and inclusive debates and warned against closed-door negotiations in small configurations.  IOANNIS VRAILAS  Deputy Head of the European Union Delegation  said the Committee's long and heavy agenda included many important and complex topics such as human resources management  various construction issues and property management  as well as numerous budgetary items.  The Union looked forward to a constructive dialogue on all the proposed agenda items and it would carefully examine the proposals from the Secretary-General on those matters and the corresponding ACABQ reports.  For the Committee to complete its programme of work by 12 December  negotiations had to be conducted in an efficient and constructive spirit  and documentation had to be available in a timely manner  particularly reports related to budget items.  HIROSHI MINAMI (Japan) recalled that the peacekeeping budget was adopted on 3 July  after the official date of completion of the Committee’s work.  Timely submission of required documentation would help the Committee meet its session’s end date.  In consideration of performance reports of the 2014-2015 budget and the 2016-2017 budget outline  any potential additional requirements would be carefully scrutinized by Japan.  The contingency fund limit was not properly observed in the previous budget; it should be adhered to strictly.  The budget outline assessment report’s call for a fresh look at needs was timely  and discussions on budgetary reform would continue.  Human resources management issues would have a great impact on the Organization.  With the General Assembly Hall renovation complete and discussions on how to deal with the Capital Master Plan’s $155 million funding shortfall set to begin  the Organization’s long-term accommodation needs required deep consideration.  Noting the Strategic Heritage Plan project team’s request for more resources  he said alternative funding mechanisms such as public-private partnerships could reduce increased overall project costs.  The peacekeeping budget would exceed its historical high of $8 billion  while implementation of Umoja and the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) was vital. CHERITH A. NORMAN CHALET (United States) said that issues discussed at the session  a human resources year  would be some of the most critical to the success of the Organization.  She reiterated her delegation's support for the new mobility policy and looked forward to discussing its progress.  Strong performance management was needed in the Organization  and the United States would judge the new proposal on whether it allowed managers to measure  reward and sanction performance.  Her Government was further committed to enhancing the United Nations internal justice system  and expected the Secretary-General's proposed assessment evaluating that system to determine whether its objectives were being met.  She expressed hope that the International Civil Service Commission's comprehensive review of compensation would result in a new package that would fairly and sustainably compensate staff.  Strengthening and protecting the OIOS mandate as well as reaffirming its operational independence was her delegation's goal when considering that Office's mandate.  Internal audit reports must be publicly disclosed.  Financing various proposals as well as promoting reform of the budget process would be considered  and a budget planning figure for the 2016-2017 biennium must be decided.  On the important issue of long-term accommodations for the Organization in New York  the United States endorsed the DC-5 option. SERGEY V. KHALIZOV (Russian Federation) stressed the importance of a balanced approach to the regular budget and the peacekeeping budget  and urged the Secretariat to enhance the effectiveness of its existing resources in a manner that would not negatively impact the delivery of mandates.  UNMEER had required an urgent decision  but the Secretary-General should present more comprehensive information regarding the structure of the Mission and its specific tasks to justify his budget request.  On the Organization's staff mobility initiative  he said there were still many open issues  urging the Secretary-General to present exhaustive answers so that the Committee could fine tune it.  As for human resources management  the Secretary-General's bulletin on benefits  issued a few months ago  altered the legal basis set by the General Assembly in its fifty-eighth session.  The Committee needed to further look into that case. United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response SUSANA MALCORRA  Chef de Cabinet of the Secretary-General  introduced a report on the resource requirements for UNMEER and the Office of the Special Envoy on Ebola (document A/69/404).  The preliminary resource requirements through the end of 2014 amounted to $49.9 million  which should be funded through a commitment authority.  The Mission was already operating in the affected region  with more than 50 UNMEER staff deployed.  The Mission would be guided by the Global Strategic Response Plan developed by the Special Envoy on Ebola in consultation with the World Health Organization (WHO). Anthony Banbury  Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the Mission  had arrived in Accra  Ghana  on 29 September  she said.  Following two days of consultations in Liberia with national authorities and other partners  Mr. Banbury went to Sierra Leone for a similar round of consultations before travelling to Guinea.  Those consultations informed the detailed planning on how best to enhance the existing capacities of the United Nations and the contributions of other partners.  The planning process would also inform the detailed budget proposal to be submitted to the Assembly later this year.  The pace at which the Ebola virus had been spreading required a significantly increased collective effort to support the national authorities and the peoples of the affected countries  she said  calling for support for the preliminary proposal.     CARLOS G. RUIZ MASSIEU  Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ)  introduced his body’s report on the same subject (document A/69/408).  The Advisory Committee recommended that the Assembly authorize the Secretary-General to enter into commitments in an amount not exceeding $49.9 million for the period from 19 September to 31 December 2014.  ACABQ would follow up on a number of issues for consideration by the Fifth Committee of the detailed budget for the Mission. SACHA SERGIO LLORENTTY SOLÍZ (Bolivia)  speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China  said the international community had to take urgent measures to prevent the regional and global spread of Ebola.  The epidemic was a public health emergency of international concern  according to the World Health Organization (WHO)  requiring emergency plans of action to halt transmissions and care for the sick.  UNMEER was the first United Nations emergency health mission and needed adequate resources to ensure mandate delivery.  Implementation of its five strategic priorities was vital  especially those relating to curbing the spread of the disease. The Group would carefully examine the Mission’s resource requirements  focusing on staffing  he said.  Resources should focus on core activities  not administrative structures.  The Secretariat should provide a detailed budget and comprehensive information on the Mission’s structure and budgetary arrangements.  The operation of the multi-partner trust fund needed to be clarified  particularly the link between the fund’s resources and those of the Mission.  ACABQ was correct on the need to clarify the specific functions and tasks of UNMEER and other partners  together with lines of accountability and responsibility.  Long-term solutions were needed  including the rebuilding of health systems and alleviation of the epidemic’s economic impact. KODJOVI DOSSEH (Togo)  speaking on behalf of the African Group and aligning with the statement by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China  said that public health issues only attracted global attention when things had gotten out of hand.  The outbreak of Ebola in West Africa continued to threaten to spread to other parts of the world.  The African Group was concerned that the situation might be worse than reported  and emphasized the importance of a coordinated and urgent response by the international community.  The African Group further endorsed the approval of a commitment of $49.9 million for UNMEER  but noted that approval of the commitment was in no way approving the structure set forth in the Secretary-General's report.  The current proposal had to be revised to ensure an effective response to the situation on the ground.  The African Group emphasized the need for the revised proposal to ensure that resources were directed to substantial and not top-heavy administrative structures. IOANNIS VRAILAS  Deputy Head of the European Union Delegation  expressed his deep concern about the Ebola outbreak crisis.  The Union was playing an important role in delivering assistance to the most affected areas  and had joined national and international efforts to tackle the disease as swiftly and efficiently as possible.  All partners must coordinate their actions.  UNMEER should work in a coordinated way to bring together the various actors  capabilities and competencies  without replacing or duplicating their actions. He said the Union appreciated that the Secretary-General was not in a position at the time to provide accurate information on the way forward or detailed budget proposals for the Mission.  In that regard  he shared the Advisory Committee’s concerns  and fully endorsed and supported all its recommendations.   The Union looked forward to receiving more comprehensive information on the concept of the Mission  its relationship with other United Nations entities  operational targets  and the timeline  as well as funding requirements  structure and organization  all in the context of the detailed budget submission expected from the Secretary-General in November.  The Union would thoroughly review and scrutinize the proposed budget in due course. JUSTIN KISOKA (United Republic of Tanzania)  aligning himself with the statements of the African Group and of the Group of 77 and China  took note of the Secretary-General’s report.  He supported the view of the Advisory Committee that the proposed structure of UNMEER be revised and re-submitted for consideration and approval in the coming weeks.  The Mission must take into account the existing leadership structures in the United Nations system to ensure that resources were dedicated to core activities  including the training of medical personnel  provision of medical facilities and medications  and logistics to combat and eliminate Ebola.  He also called for clear leadership  reporting lines and accountability in responding to the crisis. CHERITH A. NORMAN CHALET (United States) expressed her delegation's appreciation and strong support for the quick response by the United Nations to the Ebola outbreak  and sought more details on how the Mission would coordinate activities.    HIROSHI MINAMI (Japan) said that the Ebola outbreak was not only a global health concern but also an issue with regard to stability in the region.  His delegation was grateful for the efforts of the Secretary-General and supportive of the Mission.  Prime Minister Abe had last week announced Japan’s contribution of $40 million dollars to the effort to combat Ebola.  He endorsed ACABQ’s report on the proposed budget for UNMEER.  Japan looked forward to discussions on the issue  and to the Secretariat giving comprehensive  detailed and revised information on it. Ms. MALCORRA stressed that the Mission’s establishment was an “incredibly fast-track proposal”.  It was proposed on Sunday  14 September  and was approved by the Assembly on Friday  19 September.  It was done with “unprecedented” speed.  Initial resource requirements presented to ACABQ were preliminary and needed further assessment.  Member States’ concern about the duplication of resources was understood  but given the size of the Ebola response  the Mission actually ran the greater risk of being short of resources.  Quoting the Special Envoy on Ebola  she said there must be a 20-fold increase in funds for the response. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-10-03,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gapal1313.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. As the world celebrated the International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People  the situation on the ground was deteriorating  with the summer’s conflict in Gaza having caused the worst impact on civilians of all that had preceded it  and Israel continuing to expand settlements  the Palestinian Rights Committee stressed. Fode Seck (Senegal)  speaking following his election as Chair of the Committee  formally known as the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian people  said that Gaza had endured 50 days of bombing  causing thousands of civilian fatalities and injuries  while Israel took unilateral measures contravening international law and relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions.  In that context  it was clear that the Committee’s role was crucial. Summarizing the situation in Gaza  Ramesh Rajasingham  Director of the Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory  said that over 1 480 Palestinians were killed and 11 000 injured  of whom more than 3 000 were children. At least 142 families had lost more than 3 family members.  Displacement had reached 500 000 Palestinians  the highest levels of internally displaced persons since 1967. Further  he continued  there had been massive damage to property and infrastructure  including some 175 hospitals  making it difficult to tend to the wounded.  Damage to water and electricity networks was currently causing 18 hours of power cuts daily  affecting water supply and sanitation.  At the height of the conflict  1.8 million people had no access due both to the damage and restrictions on mobility.  Some 100 United Nations facilities had also been damaged. Approximately 20 000 homes had been destroyed  270 000 displaced persons were being hosted by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)  another 30 000 at Government facilities and thousands more were staying with other families.  Damage to basic infrastructure left the humanitarian community as the primary source of assistance.  The current appeal for $551.2 million would cover only humanitarian assistance with nothing for reconstruction. Richard Wright  representative of UNRWA  reiterated that reconstruction needs were in excess of original estimations.  Overall need would be about 50 per cent greater than originally anticipated for 50 000 to 80 000 refugees.  The cost of clearing unexploded munitions  approximately 10 per cent of what had been used by Israel  would also have to be covered.  In that regard  Riyad Mansour  Permanent Observer of the State of Palestine  supported the call for “stepping up to the plate” for the donor community in response to “the catastrophe” that his people were enduring.  He appealed to those participating at the upcoming donor conference in Cairo  aimed at reconstruction  to be generous  expressing hope that that meeting would have a political tenor and create movement towards a permanent resolution of the Palestinian situation.  Those attending that meeting would be supporting and strengthening the national consensus Government  agreed upon with Hamas  in undertaking the “formidable task” of restoring Gaza. Having arrived at today’s meeting from discussions on a text for a Security Council resolution on a timetable to end the occupation  he asked the Council to shoulder its responsibility to end the occupation and ensure the independence of the Palestinian State to carry out the consensus for a two-State solution. He noted further that negotiations with Israel under United States Secretary of State John Kerry had failed due to the intransigence of the Israeli side  which had been entrenching the occupation through a 123 per cent increase in settlement activities.  That was the wrong message for Israel to be sending its people.  Instead  the people should be prepared for the end of occupation. The Council’s tools should be used to that end  he continued.  However  if certain parties prevented that  facts would be changed on the ground.  “[W]e would open new doors” by joining more agencies and treaties  including the International Criminal Court.  “Whenever people close doors before us  we will not give up.  We will continue to seek peace  justice and the independence of the State of Palestine ” he said in conclusion. Christopher Grima (Malta)  Rapporteur of the Committee  presented a draft report on the work of the committee (document A/AC.183/2014/CRP.2)  focussing on its numerous conclusions and recommendations.  Among them  the Committee would call for the establishment of a fact-finding mission by the Human Rights Council  and call upon the Secretary-General to expedite the request of the Palestinian leadership that the territory of the State of Palestine be placed under an international protection system by the United Nations. It would also encourage the State of Palestine to sign further international instruments  he continued  and call upon United Nations Members and Observers to provide support to alleviate catastrophic conditions in Gaza and expedite the rebuilding effort.  In addition  it would call upon donors to meet prior commitments and provide additional aid to avert further deterioration. The Committee then approved the draft report  allowing for further discussion of one paragraph regarding outreach to regional groups at the United Nations. As today’s meeting opened  a moment of silence was observed in memory of Ibra Deguene Ka  a past Committee Chair  who passed away days earlier. Jeffrey Feltman  Under Secretary-General for Political Affairs  and Wolfgang Greiger  Director  Division of Palestinian Rights  also took part in the meeting. Also participating today were representatives of Namibia  Nicaragua  Turkey  Saudi Arabia  Morocco  Pakistan  South Africa and India. The Committee will next meet on 14 October 2014 at a time to be determined.

2014-10-03,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gadis3495.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.  The First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) met today in a brief organizational meeting to adopt its agenda and work programme for the sixty-ninth General Assembly session. According to the work programme  delegations would hold several thematic debates  as in the past year  on such topics as nuclear weapons  other weapons of mass destruction  disarmament aspects of outer space  conventional weapons  other disarmament measures and international security  regional disarmament and security  and the disarmament machinery. For the general debate  the Committee would have its usual exchange with the High Representative for Disarmament Affairs on follow-up to the resolutions and decisions approved by the Committee in 2013 and subsequently adopted by the General Assembly  also last year.  Additionally  it will have before it an extensive list of reports to be discussed during the body’s general debate. Detailing the Committee’s work programme  Courtenay Rattray  its Chair  said the general debate on all disarmament and international security-related agenda items would take place during seven meetings  from 7 to 15 October.  The Committee would then turn to its thematic discussions during 11 meetings  from 16 to 28 October.  During this second phase  the Committee would hold a panel discussion with the High Representative and other senior-level officials in the field of arms control and disarmament  focusing on “increasing the capacity of international organizations to address weapons of mass destruction”.  Mr. Rattray said he intended to circulate a concept paper on that topic. Following the thematic debates  which would also hear introduction of draft resolutions and decisions  the Committee would take action during six meetings  from 29 October to 5 November.  Upon completion of the Committee’s work  the package of texts would be forwarded to the General Assembly for its consideration  before the end of the main part of the sixty-ninth session.

2014-10-02,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaspd552.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization)  in a brief organizational meeting today  approved its work programme for the new session  which contains more than a dozen topics for consideration  including questions relating to peacekeeping  information  outer space  the effects of atomic radiation and the granting of independence to Non-Self-Governing Territories and peoples. Committee Chair Durga Prasad Bhattarai (Nepal) welcomed Vice-Chairs Inese Freimane-Deksne (Latvia) and Mordehai Amihai Bivas (Israel)  and George Patten (Liberia) following his nomination by the Group of African States and election by acclamation.  Gabriel Orellana Zabalza (Guatemala) would serve as Rapporteur. According to its work programme (documents A/C.4/69/1 and A/C.4/69/L.1)  the Committee would first consider items relating to decolonization  during a general debate to be held from 7 to 14 October. The Chair informed the Committee that he had received an aide-memoire containing 83 requests for hearings on the questions of French Polynesia  Gibraltar  Guam  New Caledonia and Western Sahara  which had been circulated to delegations by e-mail.  The Chief Minister of Gibraltar and President of New Caledonia would be addressing the Committee under the agenda item relating to Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  he added. From 15 to 17 October  the Committee would devote three meetings to international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space.  The Committee also agreed  as in previous years  to establish a working group on outer space to be chaired by the delegation of Algeria. From 21 to 23 October  the Committee would hold three meetings on questions relating to information  and convene discussions on the effects of atomic radiation  on 24 October. For four days beginning on 28 October  the Committee would conduct a comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects.

2014-09-30,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11566.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Leaders had taken to the world stage since 24 September to spotlight hopes and gains  as well as profound concerns at the start of a session that United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said could be the “most consequential” in a generation. During the sixty-ninth General Assembly debate  senior Government officials sounded the alarm about the unprecedented combination of challenges they faced  from combating a virulent form of terrorism — which some said was taking terror to a new era and a new level — to addressing its underlying causes and those of unresolved conflicts criss-crossing the globe.  The Ebola crisis crippling West Africa  along with the impacts of climate change on island nations struggling to contain it and competing priorities for a new development agenda  also led debate. Much of the focus today revolved around small island developing States  particularly on their vulnerabilities to climate change.  Delegations  from both the Caribbean and Pacific regions  described their search for adaptation and mitigation frameworks in light of their countries’ constrained capacities  including the Foreign Affairs Minister of the Bahamas  who warned  “If we do not resolve climate-change issues  there will be no Bahamas.” Voicing a similar concern  Belize’s Attorney General and Foreign Affairs Minister called climate change the most pernicious of mankind’s problems.  The cost of mitigating the damage in his country and building resilience was prohibitive  he said  calling on the large emitters to cap global warming at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Indeed  many small island developing States had reached a “tipping point”  declared Papua New Guinea’s Minister for Foreign Affairs  Trade and Immigration.  He agreed that the adverse impacts were a serious challenge to those countries’ sustainable development efforts.  However  the former President and Special Envoy of the President of Maldives stressed that  as history had showed  those States were not just viable  but valuable in finding common solutions to common problems.  It was not size but smart ideas which made a nation's destiny. Concerning the post-2015 development agenda  the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados said that in design  delivery and implementation the blueprint must address the unique vulnerabilities and challenges of small island developing States.  Bhutan’s Minister for Foreign Affairs suggested that the new agenda must be guided by a clear home-grown vision that placed people’s welfare as its central objective. No one should be left behind  asserted Benin’s representative  stressing the importance of the upcoming financing for development conference in 2015 and of building the productive capacity of least developed countries.  Even amid divergent priorities in the Assembly  broad agreement emerged that effective global partnerships were crucial for the success of the post-2015 agenda. Despite climate challenges facing the Latin America and the Caribbean region  the area was one of peace and tranquility  said Suriname’s Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He cited in particular the region’s nuclear-weapon-free status and its interdependency  which he said was a driving force of its multilateral and bilateral relations.  Most importantly  implementation of people-oriented socioeconomic policies guaranteed regional peace.  Ongoing conflicts on which there was little or no international consensus was another focus of the day’s debate.  Oman’s Foreign Affairs Minister said that the Middle East was going through a difficult phase as it grappled with several crises.  His Government supported the call for an international conference to free the region of nuclear and other mass destruction weapons. In closing the debate  General Assembly President Sam Kutesa (Uganda) urged the formulation of an ambitious and inclusive transformative agenda  accompanied by adequate implementation means.  He said that the Assembly  as a unified body  could make a real and meaningful change in people’s lives and the health of the planet.  Also speaking in the debate today were ministers  senior officials and representatives of Eritrea  Belarus  Nicaragua  Saint Lucia  Ecuador  Solomon Islands  Mauritius  Paraguay and Cabo Verde. Speaking in exercise of the right of reply were the representatives of Ukraine and the Russian Federation. Statements WINSTON G. LACKIN  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Suriname  said that some arguments used to invade Grenada were similar to those used to justify military involvement in Ukraine.  He had studied the reasoning behind the recognition of Kosovo as an independent country  comparing it with the stand against the alleged annexation of Crimea.  He had tried to understand the value of a referendum in the case of the Malvinas  and the value given to the referendum held in Crimea.  In sharp contrast to the turbulence and challenges  Latin America and the Caribbean were a relatively unique area of peace and tranquility.  “Why is this region showing us the way forward?”  he asked. First  he said  the region was nuclear-free.  Second  at the political level  interdependency had become the driving force of multilateral and bilateral relations.  Both small and large States interacted on the basis of established treaties and the principles of mutual respect.  Regional entities  such as the Union of South American Nations  Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  had played an important role in furthering those principles.  Third and most importantly  the implementation of people-oriented socioeconomic policies guaranteed regional peace. He said that more than 90 per cent of Suriname’s territory was covered with forests  which annually absorbed 8.8 million tons of carbon  while annual emissions were 7 million tons of carbon  qualifying his country as a carbon negative economy.  Paradoxically  it had become a vulnerable country as a result of climate change.  Rising sea levels would damage or destroy its coastal ecosystems  including arable land  erode gross domestic product (GDP)  and damage or destroy the homes of more than 80 per cent of the population.  Changes in rainfall patterns and rising temperatures would lead to an increase in health risks  a decrease in hydropower production  and a reduction in access to river pathways. OSMAN MOHAMMED SALEH  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Eritrea  said that  while the world had changed  the United Nations had remained stuck in the past.  In Africa  in the Middle East and on all continents  extremism  terrorism and intolerance were spreading.  Quoting the Secretary-General  he said it was a terrible time for the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  Restoring the relevance and credibility of the United Nations meant fundamentally restructuring the Organization.  This had been clear since efforts to impose a unipolar world had been unsuccessful. Eritrea's perspective was informed by its history  he said.  The Eritrean people had been denied the right to decolonization because of United States’ interests in the East Africa and Red Sea region.  When the Eritrean people had embarked on a 30-year armed struggle for national liberation  the superpowers had supplied arms to crush Eritrea's right to self-determination  and the United Nations had ignored Eritrea's plight.  The United Nations had failed to uphold an internationally endorsed border decision  also imposing unjust sanctions on his country.  All this had damaged the entire Horn of Africa region.  He called for the Security Council to end the illegal occupation of sovereign Eritrean territory  and to lift sanctions on his country. YOUSEF BIN AL-ALAWI BIN ABDULLA  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Oman  said that the Middle East was going through a difficult phase as it grappled with several crises  upon which there was no international consensus.  The Palestinian question was at the centre of conflicts in the region.  Israel was continuing to resort to military force as a tool to achieve its security  he said  calling upon both sides to resume negotiations in order to reach a settlement that would provide peace and security for Israel  and respond to the hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian people.  He further urged the Syrian Government and National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces to return to the negotiating table based on the Geneva Communiqué. Regarding the situation in Yemen  his Government welcomed the agreement between that country's President and political powers  he said  calling upon all to uphold the outcome of the National Dialogue Conference.  Turning his attention elsewhere in the Arab world  he said Oman condemned the terrorist acts perpetrated by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS).  Oman had taken several steps to avoid violence and extremism  consolidating good governance and establishing other legislative instruments  including an independent judiciary.  On international commitments  his Government supported the call for an international conference to free the Middle East region of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction. VLADIMIR MAKEI  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus  said his country this year celebrated the seventieth anniversary of its liberation from the fascist occupiers  and was remembering all victims who had paid with their lives for the nation's freedom.  Today  much like in the past  the mighty of the world believed that only their vision and development model were universal.  His country had gotten used to alien political and economic models being foisted upon it.  No less dangerous were similar attempts at imposing on it extraneous cultural preferences.  For example  they were forced to renounce the values of a traditional family  and recognize instead the diversity of the institution's forms.  He called that just another way to subdue the resisters to the capital by turning them into soulless slaves. Speaking on the post-2015 development agenda  he said the document must include many other areas  particularly the fight against human trafficking  and the strengthening of the traditional family.  The agenda should be realized through thematic and effective global partnerships among States  international organizations  civil society and the private sector.  A powerful and responsible State must remain the central pillar among all other partners  he added. WILFRED ELRINGTON  Attorney General and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Belize  said that sustained and inclusive economic growth and safeguarding the future of the planet — aimed at sustainable development with the eradication of poverty and hunger at its core — were imperatives for his country.  “[W]e must inspire and equip all actors in our societies with the requisite tools to shoulder their responsibilities and partake in the dividends of sustainable economic growth with equity and social justice ” he said.  However  without cooperation and support from developed Member States  multilateral agencies and reformed policies of the international financial institutions  his country’s efforts to attain the post-2015 development agenda would be stymied. He welcomed adoption of General Assembly resolution A/RES/304 on sovereign debt restructuring  expressing hope it would lead to a multilateral treaty that would increase the efficiency and stability of the international financial system.  Climate change was the most pernicious of mankind’s problems  and while there was consensus as to its causes and cure  the political will to take urgent action to combat it was lacking from the major emitters.  The cost of mitigating the damage in his country and of adaptation was prohibitive.  The large emitters must commit to capping global warming at 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels. Among domestic initiatives was a programme of infrastructure works  which would lead to better transport of goods produced in his country  while providing employment for many young people  he said.  And while the Government spent 26 per cent of its budget on transforming an inherited colonial educational system to one that met the needs of an independent twenty-first century country  that was not nearly enough.  Thirteen per cent of the budget went to the health sector and aimed first at prevention.  On the role of women and girls  he called for support of their financial health based on the Beijing Platform for Action.  In closing  he said that it was a false dichotomy to pit development against the environment  which was why the world must embrace the sustainable development approach. MAXINE PAMELA OMETA MCCLEAN  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados  said that in design  delivery and implementation  the post-2015 development agenda must address the unique vulnerabilities and challenges of small island developing States.  It must also make provisions for middle-income countries  which were often overlooked on the presumption that  by virtue of their GDP per capita  they did not require international assistance.  That measure could not be the sole defining criteria for accessing concessionary financing.  The social  economic and environmental vulnerability of countries such as hers must also be taken into account. On climate change  she said that her country had implemented a cross-sectoral green economy initiative  which prioritized natural resource protection policy intervention  business and investment choice  human development programming and the facilitation of export market development strategies.  However  she added  those efforts to transition to a green economy would be undone if the international community did not take action to address climate change. SAMUEL SANTOS LÓPEZ  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua  said that the negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda should begin with the central concern of not having achieved the Millennium Development Goals in all developing countries.  The future agenda should promote sustained economic growth and inclusive  participatory social development  environmental protection and human dignity.  At the same time  it should allow for sufficient flexibility in responding to the needs  priorities and particularities of each country and region  bearing in mind the non-existence of a single model for development. His country  he said  worked in a proactive way in various international and regional forums promoting policies of peace  unity and understanding among nations.  The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Nuestramérica had been a factor of unity  complementarity and economic integration in the region.  As well  the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States had deepened those countries' political  economic and cultural integration process  and the region had been declared a zone of peace.  Moreover  within the Central American Integration System  the countries were working together to fight the scourge of drug trafficking and organized crime  and to convert the Gulf of Fonseca into a zone of peace and development. MOHAMED WAHEED HASSAN  Former President and Special Envoy of the President of Maldives  said that  for the last eight decades  his country had been on a journey to consolidate democracy  last year overcoming unprecedented challenges by entirely peaceful means.  The experience of the Maldives showed that holding elections alone did not instil democratic values in a society.  What was needed was to shift the way people thought  and for democratic values to find a place in the hearts and minds of the people.  Policies needed to be rights-based  and people needed to be rights-minded.  On international affairs  he said that Palestinians were still being denied their right to a sovereign nation of their own. On terrorism  he said that misinformed yet talented young people could easily be lured into fanaticism and extremism  and that Islam's identity as a religion supporting innovation  knowledge and scholarship was slowly eroding.  The world needed to define the way it dealt with the so-called “Islamic State”  which was a terrorist group  not a religious group.  The Government and people of Maldives condemned those groups and joined fellow Muslims around the world in saying not in my name.  After noting the unique challenges faced by small island developing States  including climate change  he added that history had showed that those States were not just viable  but valuable in finding common solutions to common problems.  It was not size  but smart ideas  which made a nation's destiny. FREDERICK A. MITCHELL  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas  said that the environment  fighting crime and containing illegal immigration were his country’s top priorities.  “If we do not resolve climate change issues  there will be no Bahamas ” he warned.  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change should be the primary intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to that issue. Addressing violent crime was central to domestic peace and survival  he said  pointing to the proliferation of gang activity  illicit drugs  and small arms and ammunition trafficking as issues of concern.  As such  his country was involved in the negotiations leading to the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty  and had ratified it on 25 September.  The Bahamas would also rely on social intervention programmes like the Urban Renewal initiative in order to fight the illegal drug trade and serious crime. At the same time  the country was grappling with illegal immigration  he explained.  The recent Memorandum of Understanding signed with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) was one part of a multifaceted strategy aimed at stemming the flow of undocumented foreigners into Bahamian territory.  A new fleet of vessels had been purchased to support ongoing work in that area.  Recently  the Bahamas had entered into key fishing and migration agreements with the Dominican Republic  Cuba and Haiti.  Despite challenges  bilateral relations remained strong.  That was all the more reason why the Bahamas found the economic embargo by one neighbouring country against another “counterproductive to the peace and good order of the region”  he said. LYONPO RINZIN DORJE  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bhutan  shared some lessons his country had learned with respect to development  noting that  while they may not be universal  certain principles might have relevance.  First  he said  development must be guided by a clear home-grown vision that placed people’s welfare and happiness as its central objective.  Second  good governance was critical to unlocking the potential of a country and its people to pursue effective development and peace.  Third  within the broader development objective  the eradication of poverty must remain an overarching pursuit.  Fourth  strong partnerships were essential to delivering the post-2015 agenda.  Finally  he said  conservation of the environment for sustainability was critical  stressing that  if the basic necessities of life  such as air  food and water  were polluted or contaminated  then none of the higher-order needs in life  such as education  health care or employment  could be met. Noting that efforts to reform the Security Council remained in deadlock  he said that while a consensus decision was the most desirable way forward in multilateralism  the international community must not allow the absence of consensus to obstruct progress indefinitely  especially in the area of peace and security. ALVA ROMANUS BAPTISTE  Minister for External Affairs  Internal Trade and Civil Aviation of Saint Lucia  said that diplomacy was a prime instrument for pursuing normalized relations among all States.  The rapidly changing nature of international relations created the need to subject the United Nations system to new levels of critical examination  and to strengthen and reform the Organization's internal machinery to truly reflect today's geopolitical reality.  There should be no resumption of the Cold War.  It was time to divest ourselves of any residual effects of the Cold War  such as the blockade imposed on Cuba  which should be removed from the United States Terrorist Watch List.  His Government also called for the participation of Taiwan in international organizations  such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).  Taiwan had much to offer in terms of technological  economic and social development. Turning to the current session's theme  Delivering on and Implementing a Transformative post-2015 Development Agenda  he said two issues of paramount importance to his country were reparations for slavery and the recent conclusions of the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States (SIDS).  The case for reparations should be elaborated upon beyond the relationship between Caribbean nations and relevant European Governments.  There was a need to determine a clear and effective strategy for SIDS by which they could translate the Conference’s outcome document  the Samoa Pathway  into concrete results.  Saint Lucia stood for freedom  democracy  non-discrimination  sustainable development  poverty eradication and special and differential treatment for those States.   RIMBINK PATO  Minister for Foreign Affairs  Trade and Immigration of Papua New Guinea  said that the recent Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  held in Samoa  had been a great success.  The adverse impacts of climate change  however  continued to pose a serious challenge to the sustainable development efforts of those countries  and many had reached a tipping point.  Building on the political momentum generated  the international community should conclude a legally binding agreement in Lima and Paris in 2015 to collectively address the adverse impacts of climate change  he said. The imminent deadline of the Millennium Development Goals  and the transition to the post-2015 development agenda  was a crossroads for the international community.  After noting the achievements of his Government on reaching selected Goals  he outlined elements of Papua New Guinea's economy before turning to social issues.  Gender empowerment and equality remained a cornerstone of his Government's sustainable development agenda  and on foreign affairs  he noted his country's supply of troops to peacekeeping missions in Sudan and South Sudan.  He condemned all forms of terrorism and  touching on areas of other concern to Papua New Guinea  highlighted the international nature of the Ebola threat.  On decolonization  he urged the United Nations to support that process in New Caledonia.   LEONARDO ARIZAGA  Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs and Political Integration of Ecuador  recalling an attempted  but failed coup d'état in his country four years ago  said that because democracy had prevailed  his Government had been able to continue to build a better future for its people.  In the past seven and a half years  it had lifted 10 per cent of the population out of poverty and reduced unemployment to 4.9 per cent  the lowest rate in Latin America.  Public investment in Ecuador was highest in the continent  and three times that of the Latin American average.  Additionally  his Government had substantially reduced child and youth labour  noting that 82 schools had been added to the international baccalaureate association.  To address global warming  Ecuador had promoted renewable energy sources with fewer greenhouse gas emissions  optimized the use of raw materials and reduced waste as much as possible. Highlighting aspects of Ecuador’s foreign policy  he said it prioritized strengthening South-South relations by creating new spaces for regional governance.  In that regard  the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR)  the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of our America (ALBA) and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) remained national priorities.  In January 2015  Ecuador would assume the pro tempore presidency of CELAC.  He said it was unacceptable that the United States' blockade of Cuba had persisted for more than 20 years.  On other matters  he called for a solution through dialogue to the dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom on the Argentine Islands.  On Palestine  he called for an immediate end to operations of the Israeli army and its attacks against the civilian population in Gaza.  Noting that his country would be the headquarters for the Africa-South America Summit  he said it wished to strengthen the relationship between Africa and Latin America and  for that reason  had decided to open new embassies in Africa in the search for new opportunities. On United Nations reform  he said his country had put forward proposals for change aimed at making the Organization more efficient  democratic and inclusive.  The Security Council  he added  should be composed of groups or blocs to establish balance.  Turning to Julian Assange  to whom his country had granted asylum  he said Ecuador would continue to work tirelessly until a solution was found in that case  for which it sought support from the United Kingdom and Sweden.  He noted the recent increase in demands of transnational companies against the people of the South.  Those multi-million dollar disputes  such as the Chevron case in Ecuador  had threatened tax resources and State legitimacy  and could compromise development plans in the region and elsewhere in the world.  In that context  UNASUR was creating a regional arbitration centre to provide legal advice in investment disputes  create a code of conduct  and  with other regions  establish an observatory for transnationals  with the aim of launching support mechanisms to respond to States' requests for assistance in resolving disputes. JEAN-FRANCIS RÉGIS ZINSOU (Benin) said that the current session's theme was of prime importance to least developed countries.  The post-2015 development agenda must take into account the past 15 years of implementing the Millennium Development Goals and must place extreme poverty eradication and inclusive economic growth at its centre.  No one should be left behind.  In that regard  he stressed the importance of the Financing for Development conference in 2015.  Noting that that the Istanbul Programme of Action aimed to halve the number of least developed countries by 2020  he stressed the importance of building their productive capacity.  His country had hosted a ministerial conference on partnerships for productive capacity in least developed countries  and he urged consideration of that topic during the current Assembly session. Benin was among the top 20 countries that had made the most progress in achieving the Millennium Goals in absolute terms  he said  citing improvements in education and health  among other sectors.  Girls’ enrolment in school had increased  and the country’s universal health-care system and free health services for children under five had saved many lives.  His Government had mitigated poverty by supporting micro-credit institutions.  On peace and security  the United Nations was vital to supporting the Sahel region.  There and elsewhere  it was crucial to address the root causes of conflict and tackle such threats as translational crime  which hindered economic growth.  On human rights  Benin had abolished the death penalty  he said  urging other States to accede to the relevant convention or adopt a moratorium on the matter.  In March 2015  Benin would hold a global symposium on religious harmony  with an emphasis on Islam-Christian dialogue.  COLLIN D. BECK (Solomon Islands) said that  while his country's scorecard on the Millennium Development Goals was mixed across all eight targets  it remained committed in consolidating its gains and had begun to build a foundation to integrate the new development agenda at all levels.  Noting that a politically stable environment was critical to sustainable development  he said that recent legislation passed by his parliament in May allowed political parties to operate in a regulated and systematic manner.  To address gender violence  the parliament had passed legislation to protect families from domestic violence  deal with its perpetrators  and provide practical support for the victims.  Stressing that small island developing States represented a special case for sustainable development  in that view of their unique and particular vulnerability  his country sought closer relations with the United Nations and wished to see the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) sub-office in Solomon Islands upgraded to country-office status.  After three decades of United Nations management of Solomon Islands’ relations from abroad  it was time to invest in the relationship at the country's capital.  The Solomon Islands' partnership with the Pacific Islands Forum under the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) continued to create positive conditions  including by allowing a limited re-arming of the national police force.  On decolonization  he said all parties must cooperate to honour their commitments under the Charter and the 1960 Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.  His country was among those in the Melanesian Spearhead Group that followed the question of New Caledonia in the United Nations Decolonization Committee.  On climate change  he said the magnitude and intensity of flash floods that had occurred in his country in April had caused loss of life and the destruction of homes and infrastructure  with damages amounting to 9.2 per cent of the country's GDP.  However  despite such challenges  it was on track to developing two hydro projects in two of its provinces  in partnership with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.  In partnership with Japan  it was expanding its port facilities to promote and enable domestic  regional  and international trade.  With the support of Australia  New Zealand and the European Union  Solomon Islands had constructed several domestic airports and some 18 bridges  further uniting the country's scattered population. MILAN JAYA NYAMRAJSINGH MEETTARBHAN (Mauritius) said that 2015 would be a crucial year for the United Nations and the international community in the effort to adopt a post-2015 development agenda  with sustainable development goals.  Also in 2015  hopes were pinned on the adoption of a new  legally-binding  global climate agreement.  It would also be the year the United Nations celebrated its seventieth anniversary.  Despite such gains  inequality — both among and within nations — was still a matter of great concern.  Within the United Nations itself  the principle of equality was not always honoured.  The twin pillars of the Charter — peace and security on the one hand  and development on the other — had been undermined by the pre-eminence of political issues  which were still largely seen in terms of safeguarding dominant interests rather than from a global cooperation perspective. Inequality and vulnerability  he said  were increasing in rich and poor countries alike  and unemployment  precarious employment  lack of social protection  and access to human development and financial services were still of universal concern.  Combating Ebola demanded robust action from everyone and required exceptional international cooperation.  One in eight people in the world were undernourished  approximately 2 billion suffered from micronutrient deficiencies  and food demand  according to recent estimates  would see a 50 per cent increase.  Supporting the Secretary-General’s Zero Hunger Challenge  he said that sustainable agriculture was essential. On the part of his country’s territory that remained under colonial rule  he urged the United States and United Kingdom to recognize Mauritius’ sovereignty over the Chagos and engage in meaningful discussions to resolve the matter. JOSÉ ANTONIO DOS SANTOS (Paraguay) said that his Government was working to draft a social policy with an emphasis on such vulnerable groups as the elderly  indigenous peoples  migrant workers  disabled  women and youth.  In Paraguay   indigenous peoples spoke native languages and maintained their cultures  he said  welcoming the recent World Conference on that disadvantaged group.  He urged the organizations that worked with the United Nations in the area of democracy and social justice to set up shop in Paraguay.  His country had been seeking to occupy a seat in the Human Rights Council for the 2015-2017 term  as it felt it could play a constructive role.  His country would continue to promote the human rights of its population  including those of vulnerable groups.  Stressing the importance of social inclusion  he said that inequality was the main obstacle to development.  We must put a human face on our growth  he added  advocating for a people-centred post-2015 development agenda.  There must be greater dispensation of financial resources.  South-South cooperation was a complement to North-South and triangular cooperation.  The countries most responsible for climate change should bear a greater burden based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.  Landlocked countries  like his  should receive special treatment  owing to its geographic location  which constrained global market access  he said  drawing attention to the United Nations Conference on landlocked developing countries in November.  As the Organization marked its seventieth anniversary next year  action must be taken beyond the festivities  he said  stressing that the post-2015 agenda should lead to real development and prosperity.  FERNANDO JORGE WAHNON FERREIRA (Cabo Verde)  noting that island States were particularly vulnerable to climate change  said that finding solutions to its adverse effects was  for them  a matter of survival and territorial integrity.  Thus  it was essential to mobilize political will and international cooperation on the issue.  In that regard  he welcomed the adoption of urgent measures on climate change as a sustainable development goal  which required strategies to make Mother Earth more resilient and better equipped to pursue their implementation.  In that context  the upcoming negotiations in Lima must create significant progress towards an agreement to be signed in Paris in December 2015.  Expressing support for capping global warming at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels  he urged respect for the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. He expressed the hope that the Conference on Financing and Development  to be held in Addis Ababa in July 2015  would provide clear directives and commitments towards completion of “unfinished business” on Millennium Goal 8.  It would also help to redefine the criteria for allocating development financing based on the principles adopted in Paris and reaffirmed in Busan  Republic of Korea.  Innovative mechanisms were needed for greater consistency in development  financing and supporting economic sustainability.  The post-2015 agenda must be people-centred and aimed at eradicating extreme poverty and reducing inequalities among nations.  It should take into account lessons learned from other internationally agreed goals and accelerate the development process. The new agenda must also be rigorous with respect to human rights  he said  encouraging all Governments to consider the common good and the well-being of all citizens as they implemented development policies and programmes.  He said the recent terrorist acts threatened territorial integrity and the stability of entire regions.  “The systematic and massive violation of human rights and the barbarism that has come with it are altogether unacceptable ” he stated.  With that  he called on the international community to take urgent measures to stop attempts to create chaos and suffering of innocent people.  States had a moral obligation and collective duty to combat subversion of the universal principles of peace  tolerance  and respect for differences. Right of Reply The representative of Ukraine said that he had been surprised by the Russian Federation's statement that the situation in Ukraine had been provoked by Western nations.  It was not Western States  but the Russian Federation  that violated international law.  In 1981  the General Assembly had adopted the Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States.  There was no need to reinvent the wheel. The representative of the Russian Federation rejected the speaker's unjustified accusation against his country and urged the Government of Ukraine to honour the Minsk agreement.  What was occurring in Ukraine had been set out in the Russian Federation's statement on 27 September. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-09-29,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11565.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Sixty-ninth General Assembly Plenary 17th  18th & 19th Meetings (AM  PM & Night)     Countries at Epicentre of Ebola Crisis Discuss Lack of Preparedness  Potential for Political Crisis There was a danger of “widespread indifference” when a union of States was passive in the face of hostilities suffered by defenceless populations  the Holy See’s Secretary of State told the General Assembly on the penultimate day of its annual debate.  He said the dramatic situation in northern Iraq and some parts of Syria was exposing a new phenomenon — that of a terrorist organization vowing to dissolve States and replace them with a “pseudo-religious” world government.  He cautioned against succumbing to “exaggerated views and cultural extrapolations”  which  he said  would only lead to xenophobia and paradoxically reinforce the sentiments at the heart of terrorism  itself. To counter the attraction of terrorism for young  disillusioned people  he urged the General Assembly to focus on addressing the cultural and political origins of contemporary challenges and to further study the effectiveness of successfully implemented international law.  Aware that cultural openness alone would not counter the global nature of terrorism  he stressed that the international legal framework was the only bulwark against the new threats.  The point was echoed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iceland  who called “extremely troubling” the increasing disregard for international law as demonstrated by the growing terrorist group operating in Iraq and Syria - the self-styled Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS).  Equally shocking  he said  was “the suffering of the Syrian people and the total disrespect for humanitarian law in that country’s civil war. But Syria’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Expatriates  speaking at today’s meeting  said that implementing resolutions and conducting military strikes could help fight terrorism  but it was more important to stop States from arming  training  funding and facilitating the transit of terrorist groups.  Pressure for that purpose should be exerted on the countries that had joined the coalition led by the United States. In his region  he urged the establishment of a Middle East free of all weapons of mass destruction.  That was not achievable without Israel’s accession to all relevant treaties  by which it would have to put all its facilities under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  Israel’s Prime Minister  also speaking on the nuclear issue  said that Iran  was trying to “bamboozle” its way to an agreement to remove sanctions  to become a nuclear Power.  He warned that Iran  the world’s most dangerous regime  in the most dangerous region  would obtain the world’s most dangerous weapons.  There was only one course of action: fully dismantling that country’s nuclear capabilities.  ISIS must be defeated  but to defeat ISIS and leave Iran as a threshold nuclear Power was to win the battle and lose the war. More generally  he said hopes for peace were in danger.  Everywhere  “militant Islam” was on the march.  Its first victims had been other Muslims  but it spared no one.  For them  all politics were global  because their ultimate goal was to dominate the world.  It started out small  like a cancer that attacked a particular part of the body.  But  if left unchecked  the cancer would metastasize over wider and wider areas.  That cancer must be removed before it was too late. Representing a country at the epicentre of another transnational crisis  Ebola  the Minister of Foreign Affairs for Sierra Leone said his country was on the front lines of one of the “biggest life-and-death challenges” facing a global community “grossly ill-prepared” to tackle the spread.  The outbreak had drawn attention to globally weak infrastructure  as well as to inadequate human capital and surveillance systems.  While the United Nations response deserved praise  more resources were still needed  he said  stressing that it was the Organization’s duty to “confront human insecurity and not shun it”. Also at the forefront of the Ebola epidemic was neighbouring Liberia  whose Minister for Foreign Affairs highlighted a host of emergency measures taken by the Government to address the “crystallized denial” that had created a fertile ground for the spread of the disease.  The country’s public health system had collapsed under the weight of the deadly virus.  Ebola was not just a health crisis  he warned  it was an economic crisis  a social crisis and a potential political and security crisis.  While positive steps had recently been made  the international community must also address the virus’ long-term socioeconomic impact.   Also speaking in the debate at senior levels of Government were representatives of Sao Tome and Principe  Angola  Swaziland  Guinea-Bissau  Vanuatu  Lao People’s Democratic Republic  Bahrain  Liechtenstein  Kyrgyzstan  Botswana  Myanmar  Philippines  Burkina Faso  Cambodia  New Zealand  Singapore  Ireland  Uruguay  Monaco  Grenada  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  Yemen  Lesotho  Seychelles  Saint Kitts and Nevis  Togo and Sweden. Speaking in exercise of the right of reply was the representative of Iran. The General Assembly will meet again at 9 a.m.  30 September  to conclude its annual debate. Statements GABRIEL ARCANJO FERREIRA DA COSTA  Prime Minister of Sao Tome and Principe  said that peace and security around the world was essential for development  and he stressed the urgency of accelerated United Nations reform to allow the Organization to address new challenges with greater dynamism  representation  effectiveness  capacity and legitimacy. Turning to conflicts around the world  he said that continued international collaboration on the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Mali and Guinea-Bissau was essential to those countries’ efforts towards peace.  He congratulated the political actors in Mozambique for signing a peace agreement and avoiding more suffering and loss of human life.  He welcomed the deployment of a peacekeeping force in the Central African Republic  stating it was imperative for conflicting parties in South Sudan and Western Sahara to engage in negotiations towards mutually acceptable solutions. Pointing to a resurgence of terrorist acts across the globe  he said the international community must coordinate its actions to fight the scourge.  He expressed concern  in particular  over the actions of Boko Haram in Nigeria and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS) in the Middle East  as well as the long-standing hostilities between Israel and Palestine  and conflicts in Syria and Ukraine. On piracy  which he said strongly affected all countries bordering the Gulf of Guinea  he said his country had drafted a legislative framework for the modernization of its armed forces that focused on maritime protection.  At the subregional level  the country was working to implement the recommendations of the Yaoundé Summit as part of the partnership between the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) and the Gulf of Guinea Commission. Speaking on a range of other issues  he said that tackling the effects of climate change was a responsibility that must be shared by developed and developing countries.  He renewed his country’s call for the embargo on Cuba to be lifted to allow that country to address its economic and social development challenges.  On Ebola  he said synergies must be identified to save the thousands of lives threatened by the virus.  He called for Taiwan’s extended participation in United Nations platforms  including those that concerned climate change and the post-2015 development agenda. MANUEL DOMINGOS VICENTE  Vice-President of Angola  encouraged the Organization to pay special attention to the resurgence of armed conflicts  among other areas.  In that context  he condemned acts committed by terrorist groups and expressed support for efforts towards their neutralization and towards strengthening the United Nations crisis management capacity  emphasizing that dialogue and negotiation were the best means of resolving conflicts.  He also noted his country’s role in the peace processes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Central African Republic and the Great Lakes region.  He then expressed concern at the Ebola epidemic  which required a decisive commitment from the international community. He said that the Security Council must reflect equitable geographical representation by increasing the number of permanent members  and reiterated the right of the African continent to such status.  Lamenting the lack of progress in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  he said it was a major cause of instability in the Middle East and a root cause of the resurgence of terrorism in the region.  He called for political will from both parties  and encouraged the Secretary-General and the United States Secretary of State to continue mediation efforts.  He also called for dialogue between the parties in the Ukraine crisis to find a political solution.  Noting some progress in the situation in Somalia and South Sudan  he urged their authorities and the international community to continue efforts towards stabilization. Turning to the Millennium Development Goals  he said that developing economies continued to face barriers to economic growth caused by the global economic and financial crisis  but noted that  even so  African countries could boast an average annual growth rate of 5 per cent and improvements in several human development indicators.  Angola’s national development plan for 2013-2017 focused on providing social services to the population  diversifying the economy and consolidating macroeconomic stability.  In closing  he expressed appreciation to those countries supporting Angola’s candidature as a non-permanent member of the Security Council  stating that  in that post  it would work with partners to contribute to the world’s peace and security. BARNABAS SIBUSISO DLAMINI  Prime Minister of Swaziland  said that the outbreak of Ebola in some parts of the African continent was a new challenge facing the global community.  Adding that it was also a serious drawback to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals  he urged the United Nations and Member States to “spare no effort” in providing all the necessary assistance to curb the disease.  He thanked the General Assembly for having convened the High-level Meeting of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples  noting that indigenous knowledge and practices substantially contributed to the sustainable development agenda. He said that he was pleased that sufficient political support had been mobilized through the Climate Change Summit to guide the Conference of Parties on Climate Change to be held in Lima in December.  Climate change had a direct effect on many African countries’ national objectives to produce enough food for their populations.  The theme of the 2014 General Assembly  “Delivering on and Implementing a Transformative Post-2014 Development Agenda”  resonated well with his Government’s call for an inclusive development programme  he commented. He was “heartened”  he said  to note that the international community had not forgotten its collective inability to meet all the Millennium Development Goals.  Commending the co-chairs of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development for their work  he welcomed the goals and targets contained in the group’s outcome document.  Returning to the topic of food security  he stressed that the issue remained a critical challenge for Africa.  He reiterated his Government’s call for financial assistance  technology transfer and technical assistance so that international development goals could be achieved. The African Union’s road map for development remained critical for the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals  he said.  Pointing to bountiful investment opportunities in Africa  he urged that the development needs of the continent be accounted for the post-2015 development agenda.  On other topics  he welcomed the fact that Taiwan Province of China continued to contribute to global efforts  and he urged that country’s full participation in all United Nations structures.  Noting that thousands of people around the world were living in fear or losing their lives to terrorism and other violence  he called upon all those engaged in conflict to find lasting  peaceful solutions to their problems through dialogue. DOMINGOS SIMõES PEREIRA  Prime Minister of Guinea-Bissau  expressed gratitude for contributions to the process of political normalization in his country by the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS)  ECOWAS and other partners.  Stating that the post-conflict country still faced a “complex and difficult” situation  he called for further international assistance to consolidate stability in the current post-election period.  Priorities in that context were strengthening the State’s institutional capacity  reducing poverty and other vulnerabilities of the population  ensuring social stability  legitimizing the Government and re-launching the economy. The Government agenda  he said  had three components:  an urgent programme  to provide basic services  ensure food and livelihood  prevent the spread of Ebola and pay civil servants overdue salaries; a contingent programme  to ensure transparency and end the corruption that resulted in what he called the plundering of the country’s forestry and fishery resources; and a medium-term development programme  which would be submitted to partners in a donor conference to be held late this year or early next year.  Confidence in the country was enhanced by the national Parliament’s recent unanimous approval of these programmes  and international cooperation must be based on them in order for the country “to change course and become viable”.  For mobilizing such aid  he requested reactivation of the International Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau. On other issues  he called for enhanced international support for battling the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.  He also reaffirmed his country’s support for the African Union’s position on Security Council reform  expressed solidarity with peoples and countries that had fallen victim to terrorist attacks and reiterated the call to lift the embargo on Cuba.  He stressed that the post-2015 development agenda must be based on the objective realities of world peoples  and must draw its inspiration from the lessons of the Millennium Development Goals. On climate change  he applauded United Nations efforts to bring the issue to the fore and said that the human  economic and environmental losses in vulnerable countries such as his own were already felt.  They threatened chances for development and survival itself.  The rise of sea-levels was particularly worrisome for Guinea-Bissau.  Despite challenges  the country had set aside 12 per cent of its territory in protected zones  mostly consisting of forests  to be doubled by 2020.  As most of the population depended on forests and other natural resources for survival  however  those initiatives must be offset through financial and technological cooperation.  He finally thanked a range of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations for their development work in his country  and affirmed that Guinea-Bissau was poised for a future of peace  human security and openness. JOE NATUMAN  Prime Minister of Vanuatu  said that vulnerability must be considered when identifying whether a least developed country was ready to graduate from that status.  Recognizing the Committee on Development Policy  and the Economic and Social Council’s review  which had determined his country’s eligibility  he noted it also allowed for a grace period of four years for a “smooth transition”.  However  he cautioned that the country’s ongoing vulnerability as a small island developing State must also be addressed.  In that regard  the Government was examining the benefits it might lose  with a view to negotiating retention of certain concessions vital to sustaining economic development.  It was important not to lose sight of the real issue  vulnerability  by focussing on “smooth transition”. While his country had made progress on the Millennium Development Goals  it would be difficult to achieve all by 2015  he said.  The country’s narrow revenue base  coupled with a population dispersed among 83 islands  made it difficult to deliver basic services.  He appealed to developed countries to honour their commitments to increase their aid to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). He also said that he looked forward to the rhetoric of the Climate Change Summit being translated into urgent action  emphasizing that climate change must be one of the most important elements in the Sustainable Development Goals.  A target below 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels must be part of those targets.  Development partners should work in harmony and in the true spirit of partnership to fulfil the dreams of his people  particularly of the younger and vulnerable generation.  The United Nations should accept the views of the Commonwealth Heads of Governments as additional input in the post-2015 development agenda. Underscoring the unfinished business of decolonization  he noted that part of his country’s sovereign territory was still in dispute by one of its former colonial Powers.  He expressed delight that the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples had brought the matter to the Human Rights Council in Geneva  and that France had responded with an openness to dialogue.  He also voiced support for the conclusions and recommendations in the report of the United Nations mission to New Caledonia  and called on the Organization and the international community to continue supporting the efforts of New Caledonia and France to implement a successful decolonization process under the Noumea Accord. He further called on the Organization  through its regional agencies  to provide assistance to New Caledonia  in particular the Front de Liberation Nationale Kanak et Socialiste and the Kanak people  through training that would enable them to fully participate in that Accord.  Noting that concerns for vulnerability  sustainable development  fisheries  job creation and human rights  among others  were reflected in the Samoa Pathway document  he urged that it be integrated into a transformative post-2015 development agenda  and that gaps in the implementation of Barbados Programme of Action be closed. PIETRO PAROLIN  Secretary of State for the Holy See  said that Pope Francis had observed a danger of widespread indifference.  When a union of States remained passive in the face of hostilities suffered by defenceless populations  the General Assembly had to deepen its understanding of the difficult and complex events occurring at present time.  The “dramatic” situation in northern Iraq and some parts of Syria was showing the international community a new phenomenon  that of a terrorist organization threatening all States  vowing to dissolve them and replace them with a pseudo-religious world government.  Such violence was borne out of a disregard for God and falsified religion itself. To counter young  disillusioned people from around the world being attracted to that new phenomenon  he urged the General Assembly to focus on addressing the cultural and political origins of contemporary challenges  and also to further study the effectiveness of successfully implemented international law.  The challenges posed by the new forms of terrorism should not make the international community succumb to “exaggerated views and cultural extrapolations”  he noted.  That would only lead to reactions of a xenophobic nature  which would paradoxically reinforce the sentiments at the heart of terrorism itself.  The paths open to the international community were then in promoting dialogue and in a true commitment to peace. Nonetheless  the threat of terrorism could not be faced with cultural openness alone  he said  stressing that “the important path of international law is also available to us”.  The global nature of the new terrorism was precisely why the framework of international law offered the only viable way of dealing with the urgent challenge it presented.  It was urgent to stop aggression through multilateral action and a proportionate use of force.  However  that the international community had responded to conflicts in Syria  the Middle East and Ukraine with contradictory voices and with silence was disappointing. He also pointed out that  in regards to development and poverty  the principle of “responsibility to protect” applied to the protection of people against forms of aggression  such as a financial system governed only by speculation and the maximization of profits.  Social and economic justice  he underscored  was an essential condition for peace. WALID AL-MOUALEM  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria  said that the 15 August Security Council resolution that condemned abuse of human rights by extremist groups in his country and Iraq had not stopped some regional States from continuing to provide support to terrorist organizations.  In addition  the United States was applying double standards by providing money and weapons to groups it called “moderate”.  Implementing resolutions and conducting military strikes could help fight terrorism  but it was more important to stop States from arming  training  funding and facilitating the transit of terrorist groups.  Pressure for that purpose should be exerted on the countries that had joined the coalition led by the United States. Syria  he said  had unconditionally agreed to attend the Geneva II Conference  and had done so with an open mind.  But  the delegation negotiating with his Government was following the orders of its Western masters  and did not believe in combating terrorism  nor did it respect Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Now  however  the international community was adopting the Syrian perspective that fighting terrorism topped all priorities.  With regard to ending the conflict  he said Syrians had made their choice in legitimate presidential elections  but his Government was open to a political solution with a “real” opposition that aimed for prosperity  stability and security. He said that inhumane sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States had aggravated the living conditions of Syrians  and some States had put Syrian refugees in military camps or other places of detention.  His Government  on the other hand  guaranteed a safe return and decent life for those willing to repatriate.  In addition  Syria had fulfilled its obligations regarding chemical weapons.  Were it not for Syrian cooperation  the Joint Mission of the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons would not have completed their tasks.  “The big question that remains is whether those who are supplying the terrorists with this and other types of weapons will stop their actions and abide by international law ” he said. Turning to other issues  he called for establishing a Middle East free of all weapons of mass destruction  which he said was not achievable without the accession of Israel to all relevant treaties  putting all its facilities under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  Syria was committed to ending the Israeli occupation of the Golan  and rejected all actions to change its natural  geographical and demographic characteristics.  He called for the lifting of the blockade against Cuba  and of all unilateral coercive measures imposed on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  Iran  Venezuela and Belarus  as well as those on Syria. THONGLOUN SISOULITH  Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic  said that the world had just over 450 days left in which to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  As a landlocked and least developed country  his nation still faced challenges in achieving targets on reducing child malnutrition  ensuring gender equality in education  reducing child and maternal mortality and also in minimizing the impact of unexploded ordnance left over since the war.  The full  effective implementation of the Oslo Convention on Cluster Munitions was of great importance  he said  expressing hope that other countries would consider becoming parties to the Convention.  It was time for the unilateral embargo on Cuba to be lifted. In order to deal with the complex and unpredictable circumstances facing the world today  the United Nations needed to strengthen itself through reform of key organs  he said.  The rapid growth of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) had convinced his Government that the members of the organization would achieve their goal of becoming a single market and production base in 2015.  Turning to the situation in his own country  he noted that landlocked developing countries were in a special situation  facing “daunting challenges” and marginalization in many areas.  The second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries  to be held in Vienna in November  was  therefore  of great significance in order to adopt a new programme of action for those countries in the next decade. SHAIKH KHALID BIN AHMED AL KHALIFA  Foreign Minister of Bahrain  said his country’s region was going through a phase of extreme difficulty  in which a climate of instability  chaos  tension and savage  bloody and unprecedented terrorism prevailed.  Contributing to those were many factors  the most prominent of which were three challenges.  The first was the accelerated emergence of terrorist groups with various global dimensions and affiliations.  They thrived in the region  not only targeting innocent people  but also carrying out inhumane practices  such as mass murder  public beheadings and the persecution of ethnic and religious minorities.  Combating terrorist groups required the international community to work together in the security  military and financial aspects  and in fighting ideology that deformed human nature and disfigured Islamic principles. The second challenge to the security and stability of the region was represented by political expansionism and attempts to impose hegemony in disregard of the sovereignty of States  and to interfere in their internal affairs  he said.  The entire region as a result had suffered from attempts to export seditious revolutions and to train terrorists in violation of international law and United Nations principles.  One form of such interference was the use of media  notably satellite television channels and social media  which were misused to distort facts and cause instability in the region.  On Iraq  there was hope that the election of President Fouad Massoum and the formation of the new Government under Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi would enhance the political and development processes and contribute to the security and stability of that country.  Concerning Syria  he said it was necessary to remove barriers that stood in the way of humanitarian assistance.  On Libya  he then expressed concern at the deteriorating security situation there and its repercussion on the stability of its neighbouring countries.  In light of those conflicts  he reiterated the call to make the Middle East a region free of weapons of mass destruction  notably nuclear weapons  and expressed support for the “5+1” group with a view of reaching a swift solution to the Iranian nuclear programme. The third challenge was the illegal occupation of other States’ territories in contradiction of the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter  he said.  That was notably illustrated by the violations committed by Israel  and its targeting of Palestinian people by confiscating their land and imposing blockades on them.  In that regard  it was imperative to specify a time frame by which Israeli occupation must end  so that the Palestinians may realize their aspirations for an independent State.  Concerning the occupation by Iran of the three islands — Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa — belonging to the United Arab Emirates  he rejected that occupation  and called on Iran to heed the efforts of the United Arab Emirates to solve the problem through direct negotiations or through arbitration by the International Court of Justice. AURELIA FRICK  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Liechtenstein  calling upon leaders to unite  said  “at a time when the world seems to be breaking apart  it will serve us well to remember what unites us”  as shown in the United Nations Charter.  The Organization was created to prevent war.  Acts of aggression against Ukraine and the illegal annexation of parts of its territory were “massive violations” of the Charter’s principles and a major setback for Europe.  They underlined the need to ensure enforcement of international law.  She would not accept that a Security Council veto be used to contradict the purposes of the Organization  as had been seen too often.  Permanent Council members must make a clear commitment not to vote against action to prevent or end atrocity crimes. On human rights  she said that the digital era was uprooting the right to privacy and that discrimination based on gender  sexual orientation  nationality or ethnicity  religion or disability remained rampant in much of the world.  She expressed particular concern at the rise of religious intolerance  stating that the Assembly must issue a call against persecution of any religious minority anywhere.  The core principles of the Geneva Conventions  among the most successful treaties with nearly universal acceptance  were being violated daily.  In that context  she cited the suffering of civilians in the Gaza conflict  Syria and Iraq.  The commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the 1995 fourth World Conference on Women  held in Beijing  was an opportunity to show commitment to its outcome. Noting successes in justice and the rule of law  she singled out the International Criminal Court.  Her country had created an informal network of Ministers to protect it from political attacks  with the goal of making the Rome Statute a universal treaty.  Turning to development  she said that the Millennium Development Goals had been a learning process and there were three areas to improve upon going forward.  First  rule of law must be at the heart of the Sustainable Development Goals.  Second  women’s empowerment was essential to sustainable development.  Finally  a system should be established to monitor progress in implementing the post-2015 agenda involving all stakeholders.  The high-level political forum would be the best anchor for such a system. ERLAN ABDYLDAYEV  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kyrgyzstan  said that perpetual instability  increasing disputes among leading world Powers and the absence of a clear vision for a future world order had enabled terrorist and extremist groups to fill the vacuum and influence the world situation.  In that context  strengthening human rights and the rule of law were ever more relevant.  Those principles were an integral part of his country’s development.  Indeed the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections would strengthen its democratic foundations.  To that end  he requested the international community’s help in implementing its far-reaching goals.  He also reiterated the country’s candidacy for the Human Rights Council for the 2016-2018 period. The most serious external challenge to Central Asia  he said  was the situation in Afghanistan  and the illegal trafficking of its drugs.  He called on the international community to strengthen the capacity of regional law enforcement agencies and promote regional cooperation.  Another important factor in regional instability was unresolved border issues.  Their resolution would facilitate regional transit potential  the development of cross-border infrastructure  economic improvement and decreased social tension.  He called on all Central Asian States to support his President’s initiative to develop and sign bilateral agreements on confidence-building concerning borders. As a landlocked  mountainous country  Kyrgyzstan’s development had been restricted by its remoteness  lack of access to major international transport networks and its particular vulnerability to climate change  he said.  An international development fund to provide assistance to developing landlocked countries would be beneficial.  Recognizing the links among the environment  climate and sustainable development  he said vulnerable countries’ interests must be addressed adequately in future global actions.  Further  the linkage between water resources and energy made developing hydropower a prerequisite for sustainable development.  The issue of affordable energy should be reflected in the post-2015 agenda.  The restoration and security of uranium tailings in Kyrgyzstan was a serious transboundary problem for Central Asia  he said  calling for assistance in solving the problem of radioactive and toxic waste. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU  Prime Minister of Israel  said hopes for peace were in danger.  Everywhere they looked  militant Islam was on the march.  It was not militancy  it was not Islam  but specifically “militant Islam”.  Its first victims were other Muslims  but it spared no one.  For the militant Islamists  all politics were global  because their ultimate goal was to dominate the world.  It started out small  like a cancer that attacked a particular part of the body.  But  if left unchecked  the cancer would metastasize over wider and wider areas.  That cancer must be removed before it was too late. Last week  many countries rightly applauded United States President Barack Obama for leading the effort to confront the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS)  he said.  Yet  weeks before  some of those same countries had opposed Israel for confronting Hamas.  Evidently they did not understand that ISIS and Hamas were branches of the same poisonous tree.  They shared a fanatical creed  which they sought to impose well beyond their own territories.  When it came to their ultimate goals  Hamas was ISIS and ISIS was Hamas  and they were all militant Islamists  be they Boko Haram  Al Shabaab  various Al-Qaida branches or other terrorist groups.  They shared a goal for a land with no tolerance  where women were chattel and minorities were subjugated  and sometimes presented the same stark choice:  convert or die.  Anyone could be considered an infidel  including fellow Muslims. The Nazis had believed in a master race  while the militant Islamists believed in a master faith  he said.  Militant Islamists simply disagreed over who among them would be the master of the master faith; there was one place where that could soon happen  namely  the “Islamic State” of Iran.  For 35 years  Iran had pursued the global mission to export revolution.  Saying Iran did not practise terrorism was like saying Derek Jeter never played shortstop.  The international community should not be fooled by Iran’s manipulative “charm offensive”  as it was designed to lift the sanctions and remove obstacles for Iran’s path to the bomb.  The Islamic Republic was trying to bamboozle its way to an agreement to remove sanctions  so it could become a nuclear Power.  Iran  which was the world’s most dangerous regime  in the most dangerous region  would obtain the world’s most dangerous weapons. There was only one course of action:  Iran’s nuclear capabilities must be fully dismantled  and ISIS must be defeated; to defeat ISIS and leave Iran as a threshold nuclear Power was to win the battle and lose the war  he said.  The fight against militant Islam was indivisible; when militant Islam succeeded anywhere  it was emboldened everywhere.  When it suffered a blow in one place  it was set back in every other place.  That was why the fight against Hamas was for all countries.  For 50 days this past summer  Hamas fired thousands of rockets at Israel  many of them supplied by Iran.  Israel faced a propaganda war  because in an attempt to win the world’s sympathy  Hamas had cynically used Palestinian civilians as human shields and United Nations schools to store and fire rockets.  While Israel surgically struck at the rocket launchers and “terror tunnels”  Palestinian civilians were tragically  but unintentionally killed. Heart-wrenching photographs had left the impression that Israel was targeting civilians  but it was not  he went on.  No other army had gone to greater lengths to avoid civilian causalities among the population of its enemies.  Hamas deliberately placed its rockets where Palestinian children lived and played.  Israel was using missiles to protect its children  while Hamas was using its children to protect its missiles.  After decades of seeing Israel as the enemy  States in the Arab world increasingly recognized that they faced many of the same dangers as Israel.  Israel was ready to make an historic compromise and was willing to work with its Arab neighbours  even though that might defy conventional wisdom. GUNNAR BRAGI SVEINSSON  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iceland  said that extremely troubling among issues facing the international community today was the increasing disregard for international law demonstrated by ISIL  the growing terrorist group operating in Iraq and Syria.  Equally shocking was the suffering of the Syrian people and the total disrespect for humanitarian law in that country’s civil war  where almost 200 000 people had died.  Noting that the prolonged foreign occupation of the State of Palestine was another violation of international law  he condemned the indiscriminate rocket attacks from Hamas and other militant organizations in Gaza against civilian targets in Israel  as well as the disproportionate use of force by the Israel Defense Forces. Turning to Eastern Europe  he said the violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity breached the Charter  international law and numerous treaties.  The illegal annexation of Crimea also threatened security and stability throughout Europe.  Further  the Security Council’s credibility was seriously undermined when a permanent member violated the Charter by using force to change borders and then could veto the necessary response and actions by that body empowered to maintain international peace and security.  Noting the need to improve the Council’s working methods  he expressed support for the French- and Mexican-led proposal for refraining from using the veto in cases of mass atrocities. On the post-2015 agenda  he highlighted the importance of resolving ocean-related issues and desertification  land degradation and drought  in order to ensure food security.  In that regard  his country had shared its knowledge through the United Nations University’s Fisheries Training Programme in Iceland  and had actively contributed to efforts to achieve a land degradation-neutral world through the Group of Friends in New York and the United Nations University’s Land Restoration Training Programme in Iceland.  As no society could function without energy  he said it was also important to focus on ensuring access to affordable  reliable  sustainable and modern energy for all.  Iceland also contributed to that effort by working with a group of countries and the International Renewable Energy Agency to identify opportunities to increase geothermal production. PHANDU T.C. SKELEMANI  Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Botswana  said that  while his country had made impressive gains in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals  it was not without enormous challenges  particularly those posed by resource and capacity constraints.  Nonetheless  the Government had strived to improve its citizens’ quality of life by allocating a substantial percentage of its budget to sectors such as education  health  infrastructure  development of human capital  women and youth empowerment.  Botswana would also participate in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda  wherein the challenges faced by landlocked developing countries  such as his own  should be made a primary consideration. He voiced grave concern about the increasing trend of instability  insecurity and violent conflict in various parts of the world.  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict  as well as the protracted brutal war in Syria  defied human imagination.  In Africa  the frequent eruption of violent conflict in certain parts of the continent  particularly in South Sudan and the Central African Republic  was distressing.  Iraq was also under siege of terrorist groups  which threatened not only the stability and security of the Middle East  but also the maintenance of international peace and security at large.  States’ failure to protect populations from impunity  war crimes and crimes against humanity was  in effect  their inadvertent acquiescence in the annihilation of future generations.  It was  therefore  incumbent upon members of the Security Council to demonstrate exemplary leadership and a genuine regard for their responsibility  to maintain international peace and security as mandated by the United Nations Charter. He also voiced deep concern that some permanent members of the Council had consistently thwarted others’ efforts to find lasting solutions to conflict situations.  The Council’s failure in May of this year to adopt a resolution seeking to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court was nothing short of a travesty of international criminal justice.  Botswana supported the independence and credibility of the Court  which was the only existing international mechanism available for the investigation and prosecution of genocide  war crimes  crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression.  As such  the role of the Security Council in facilitating the Court’s work could not be overemphasized. WUNNA MAUNG LWIN  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Myanmar  said that climate change was an issue of survival requiring urgent action.  A new global commitment on climate protection and emission reduction objectives must be reached.  Eradication of extreme poverty and delivering sustainable and inclusive development must remain the central objective of the post-2015 development agenda  while finding effective means of implementation  including mobilizing financial and technological support to ensure success of the agenda and of sustainable development goals.  Also  the unprecedented nature and scope of the Ebola outbreak demanded that all available resources and expertise be mobilized  and terrorism’s ruthless killings and atrocities in the name of religion must not be tolerated. Noting that cooperation between Myanmar and the United Nations was better than ever  and that one of the Organization’s main goals was peace and security  he encouraged all Member States to support a draft resolution on nuclear disarmament his country had tabled every year since 1995  and would again at the current session.  Further on disarmament  he noted that Myanmar’s Parliament had just approved its accession to the Biological Weapons Convention.  While the country’s transition to democracy was peaceful  there were many challenges to overcome.  He asked that the international community’s support for economic development and capacity-building lay a solid foundation for a democratic society. The Government was laying the foundation for free and fair elections  in which all political parties would take part  he said.  The final decision would come from the people on election day.  Further  the Government was committed to the success of the peace process to end the six-decade conflict  with agreements reached with 14 of 16 armed ethnic groups.  Strides had also been made in the areas of human rights  press freedom  combating human trafficking and gender violence.  The Government was also working to resolve the complex issues that caused interethnic violence in Rakhine State.  Improvement had also been seen in rural living standards  and there had been increasing rates of growth over the past three years.  As a result  Myanmar had initiated the internal process of graduating from least developed country status. ALBERT F. DEL ROSARIO  Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the Philippines  said his country’s score-card on the Millennium Development Goals showed considerable progress in the areas of poverty eradication  child mortality  access to safe drinking water  gender equality and the fight against both malaria and tuberculosis.  But  the country continued to face challenges in other areas.  In that regard  it aimed to strengthen its data collection and analysis to better measure the goals and aid in decision-making.  The greatest challenge to achieving the Millennium targets was the series of natural disasters experienced by his country  most notably super typhoon Haiyan  the strongest typhoon in recorded history.  That event reminded the world of the urgency in addressing climate change.  He looked forward to the forthcoming third World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai  Japan  as well as the first-ever global Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul  Turkey  where the Philippines hoped to share lessons learned from typhoon Haiyan. Development efforts were jeopardized by setbacks due to threats to peace  security and the rule of law  he said.  It was vital to ensure that conflicts did not undermine the development agenda.  He heralded his country’s achievements in building peace in the southern Philippines  where the signing of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro had helped bring new investments  jobs  economic opportunities  access to basic services and infrastructure.  The rule of law was instrumental in resolving these tensions.  At the same time  bringing an end to maritime disputes would require adherence to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.  On this issue  the Philippines had invited a State party to settle its maritime disputes peacefully through the Convention  specifically the arbitration measures under Annex 7.  Instead  the State had embarked on a series of “dangerous  reckless and forceful activities” that violated the rights of his country and threatened peace and stability in the South China Sea. He also expressed deep concern over the threat of weapons of mass destruction from the Middle East to the Korean peninsula.  The Philippines supported the complete elimination of nuclear  biological and chemical weapons  and called for the Conference on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons to convene as soon as possible.  The Six-Party talks on the Korean peninsula should also resume  he said  adding that a successful outcome to the 2015 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference was needed to ensure the credibility of the Treaty.  Moreover  the Philippines strongly supported the ongoing discourse on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons that had been gaining ground both within and outside of the United Nations. DJIBRILL YPÈNÈ BASSOLÉ  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso  welcomed the appointment of the Special Envoy on Ebola  and said the initiative to combat the disease would allow the West African subregion to strengthen its systems of public health.  Efforts of development could only succeed within a context of stability and peace.  Burkina Faso thus continued to create a culture of tolerance and peaceful coexistence  strengthen the momentum of democracy and respect the rights of individual and collective freedoms. He welcomed the recent adoption by the Human Rights Council of efforts to eliminate female genital mutilation.  In Mali and elsewhere in the Sahel  armed conflicts were becoming more extreme and more radical.  Those were characterized by trafficking in drugs  weapons and humans  and there was a shared responsibility to eradicate those ills.  Poverty  youth unemployment and the denial of rights and justice were results of that imbalance.  Defence and security forces needed to fight effectively against terrorist threats.  In that regard  he thanked partners  including France and the United States  for efforts to make the Sahel safer. No effort must be spared to protect the soldiers of peace  he said  who risked life and limb to bring safety and comfort to civilian populations.  Burkina Faso would continue to participate in peacekeeping missions.  He called for the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty  and to create conditions of equitable and sustainable development for all peoples through the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.  Regarding the embargo against Cuba  he said that his country favoured lifting it.  The role of the United Nations was irreplaceable  and he supported reforms of the Security Council and the General Assembly.  Given the current state of world security  it was reasonable for there to be representatives of other continents on the Security Council. HOR NAMHONG  Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Cambodia  said that armed conflicts were threatening peace  stability and human security not only in the affected regions but also the world at large.  Cambodia had contributed to peace  with more than 2 000 Cambodian peacekeepers deployed to date in Lebanon  Mali and South Sudan.  Another detachment of peacekeepers would soon be deployed to the Central African Republic as part of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission (MINUSCA)  he added. He cited climate change as a global challenge and a human security issue  noting that its pace was having “devastating effects”.  Agriculture-dependent developing countries had suffered acutely  with a marked increase in the frequency of typhoons  storms  floods and draughts.  As an example  the 2013 monsoon in Cambodia had resulted in floods across the country  causing $1 billion in damages and affecting an estimated 1.8 million people.  While industrialized countries were responsible for emitting the largest amount of greenhouse gases  developing countries bore the brunt of climate change.  It was vital the international community prioritized actions to address climate change based on the United Nations principles of “common but differentiated responsibilities”.  To that end  Cambodia had adopted the “Strategic Plan on Green Development for 2013-2030”  which aimed to achieve economic and social development in a sustainable manner.  As a member of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  Cambodia was fully engaged in furthering the goals of the 2009 ASEAN Climate Change Initiative. On the Millennium Development Goals  Cambodia explained that it had adopted its own development targets  which have been incorporated into the country’s National Strategic Development Plan.  As a result  substantial progress had been achieved and Cambodia had met some of the goals ahead of schedule  including reducing the poverty rate to 19.5 per cent.  The country had also made great strides in combating HIV/AIDS  reducing HIV prevalence to 0.6 per cent in 2013.  The post-2015 development agenda should be realistic and build upon the lessons learned to ensure a “balanced and comprehensive” framework. MURRAY MCCULLY  Minister for Foreign Affairs of New Zealand  hailing the success of the recent small island developing States conference  the extraordinary work of the host  Samoa  as well as the ownership of the agenda by the States themselves  said that  while the multilateral world was “awash with talk” of strategies and funds  out in the “real world” of those small islands  not enough was happening on the ground.  Pacific nations spent 10 per cent of their gross domestic product and up to 30 per cent of their total bills on importing diesel for electricity generation  he pointed out.  Sustainable economic development simply could not happen in that region without renewable energy.  Some of the significant progress achieved in that field included Tokelau moving from 100 per cent dependence on fossil fuels to 93 per cent renewable  the opening of a 2.2 megawatt solar array in Samoa  and all of the outer islands of Tuvalu becoming 100 per cent renewable-based. Sustainable fisheries were the biggest economic asset in the Pacific  he continued.  New Zealand had committed over $70 million over the next five years to advance a comprehensive approach for strengthening commercial fishing practices.  While small island developing States were showing real leadership in addressing climate change  they also required action on a global scale.  Turning to the Middle East  he welcomed the ceasefire between Israel and Gaza  but voiced profound regret of Israel’s appropriation of 400 hectares of privately owned Palestinian land near Bethlehem for settlements. In Syria and Iraq truly frightening consequences were occurring when leadership  both internally and in the Security Council  had failed  he said.  The international community needed to find a way to contain the madness of ISIL  to address the humanitarian tragedy and to help the people of Syria and Iraq craft a better future.  That situation cried out for the Security Council’s attention. Paralysis had also prevailed in the Council over Ukraine  with that body becoming essentially a bystander while one of its permanent members undermined the integrity of another Member State. He also pointed out that events in the Middle East and Ukraine had dominated the headlines in recent months  diverting attention from serious situations that continued to play out in Africa  particularly Libya  Mali  Central African Republic  South Sudan  Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Deeply troubled by the unprecedented scale of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa  he said he recognized the huge challenges that were posed to the economies and to political and security cohesion in the region.  New Zealand had contributed to the humanitarian work under way  and would continue to do so while looking to further practical steps to support the international effort. K. SHANMUGAM  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Singapore  condemned the terrorist actions of “ISIS”.  Such threats were not confined to the Middle East  but affected the whole world.  In addition to military and intelligence efforts  the radical ideology used to recruit the foreign fighters that were fuelling that group’s extremist agenda must be combated as well.  The leadership of the United States in the formation of an international coalition was welcomed  as was the Jeddah Declaration put forth by Arab countries.  As co-sponsor of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) on foreign terrorist fighters  Singapore believed that text was an important step to combat global terrorism by cutting off financial support for “ISIS” and preventing the movement of foreign terrorist fighters. Turning to the post-2015 development agenda  he commended the Open Working Group and said he looked forward to the Secretary-General’s report on that Group’s recommendations.  As Co-Chair of the preparatory committee for the recent conference in Samoa on small island developing States  he emphasized that it was important that the views of small States were factored into the post-2015 development agenda  he said.  The Millennium Development Goals had been successful  due to the framework’s pragmatic  outcome-based and quantifiable approach.  That method should be continued for the post-2015 development agenda.  Furthermore  any Millennium Development Goals not yet achieved should be prioritized in the post-2015 framework. He went on to stress the importance of building sustainable cities  highlighting that more than half of the world’s population live in urban areas  a figure that was projected to reach 70 per cent by 2050.  Most of that growth would take place in Africa  Asia and Latin America  where mismanaged urbanization could intensify inequalities.  At the same time  successful cities could raise living standards and contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  particularly in reducing poverty.  The challenge was to manage urbanization well.  Singapore was co-chairing the Group of Friends for Sustainable Cities and establishing Singapore’s Centre for Liveable Cities in 2008.  The Liveability Framework  a tool designed to help countries define the policies needed to achieve that goal  was also being developed.  Looking ahead  he voiced hoped that the Framework would be part of discussions during the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) in 2016. CHARLES FLANAGAN  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Ireland  said his Government wished to see veto power eventually abolished in the Security Council and  therefore  welcomed France’s initiative to regulate that power.  The body should increase its membership to reflect regional balances and the current global realities of population and economic weight.  On the Middle East  it was time to attain a comprehensive peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.  He was not under any illusions about the difficult and painful compromises to be made  but believed both parties supported a just  negotiated two-State solution. Turning to the Syrian conflict  he said that the flagrant violation of international law by all sides must be confronted and referred to the International Criminal Court.  Those parties  particularly the Assad regime  must end their obstruction of vital humanitarian efforts.  The growth of extremism in the Middle East was of significant concern  he said  adding that the “bloodlust and inhumanity” displayed by ISIL in Syria and Iraq had appalled all civilized people.  That threat must be addressed with unity and with a real sense of urgency.  On the Ukraine crisis  he opposed a military solution  supported the path of diplomatic dialogue and welcomed the Ukrainian President’s peace plan.  A sustainable political solution must be based on the principle of respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and with clear guarantees on border security  the disarmament of all illegal groups and the withdrawal of foreign forces. LUIS ALMAGRO  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay  said that the world was a hard place  where 6 million children died before the age of five  many from malnutrition; where violence had reached a new level of terror and horror with thousands dead in Libya  Syria and Iraq; and where human rights violations were a daily occurrence.  Global governance was inspired not by rights  but by interests  forcing people to migrate from their homes and cope with violence  fear and death.  Eight million died annually from tobacco use  which he described as an “act of genocide” because the operation of less regulated free markets was placed above human rights and human health.  The United Nations had failed ethically by not providing better solutions for people. The Millennium Development Goals were a useful tool  he continued  but countries should not be left alone in their efforts.  Turning to the sustainable development goals  he said those must focus on poverty eradication through the lens of human rights.  It was necessary to increase GDP  exports and investments  but all efforts must be based on guaranteed rights and protection against inequality.  The women’s agenda was one of the most powerful vectors for development  he said  adding that any kind of discrimination was counter to social needs; ever more people should be protected.  Also  national policies should promote a healthy lifestyle.  Food insecurity resulted from bad global policies  he said.  Noting that 30 to 50 per cent of food produced was never consumed  he said that excess could end global hunger. He said that addressing climate change was a moral imperative for every person in the room  and should be undertaken from the perspective of combating poverty  inequality and exclusion.  Uruguay rejected any unilateral actions that contravened international law.  In that regard  he condemned the United States blockade of Cuba and demanded that the island State be struck from the list of countries protecting terrorism.  On another area of concern  he said that sovereign debt must be restructured and the speculative “vulture funds” must be stopped.  Global peace and security were essential  and to that end  Uruguay contributed peacekeepers both in Haiti and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. JOSÉ BADIA  Minister for External Relations of Monaco  said that the experience of the Millennium Development Goals taught that future goals must be based on the three pillars of sustainable development.  In defining the post-2015 development agenda  all States must contribute  as must all other stakeholders: the private sector  universities  philanthropic organizations and non-governmental organizations.  The agenda must be inclusive  participatory and based on good governance.  At a time when the world was ever more interdependent  inequalities continued to grow and too many were marginalized. Noting the escalation of conflicts over the past year  he called for a peaceful settlement to the situation in Ukraine and condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria and the assault on civilian targets in Syria  Iraq  Gaza  South Sudan  Central African Republic and Nigeria.  Furthermore  he spoke out against the reprehensible crimes committed by terrorist groups in the name of religion  which undermined society and spread hate and chaos on social media.  The marginalized and excluded  among them many young people who had not benefitted from “progress”  were drawn to such groups.  Policies for social integration  education and youth employment were needed.  The promotion and protection of human rights must be at the heart of policies. The unprecedented threat of Ebola in West Africa tested the global capacity to respond in an efficient and coordinated manner  he said  expressing support for the Organization’s emergency mission to confront the menace.  The new paradigm for post-2015 development must accommodate a growing population and its accompanying urbanization.  Addressing climate change required everyone to adopt new models of production  consumption and transport.  It was time to break the ceiling that had held women back  for without their participation  sustainable development would not be achieved.  On the recent Climate Summit  he said that success must be measured not only by commitments made but the ownership of the process by those affected. SAMURA M. W. KAMARA  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sierra Leone  said his country was at the forefront of “one of the biggest life-and-death challenges facing the global community”.  The Ebola outbreak was especially worrying because it had mutated into a global phenomenon for which his country  the region  and the global community were “grossly ill-prepared”.  The Ebola outbreak highlighted the globally weak infrastructure as well as inadequate human capital and surveillance systems.  Slow recognition of the challenge had been accompanied by spontaneous fear and panic  which had led to border closures and travel restrictions.  Moreover  the outbreak had hit Sierra Leone as it was making its “fast-paced” recovery from 10 years of devastating conflict. The international community was finally responding to Ebola as a global challenge  he said  noting Sierra Leone’s extraordinary national response measures.  Health educators were teaching citizens about Ebola’s dangers  while cultural practices like shaking hands and burial ceremonies were curtailed.  At the same time  development projects had been suspended and gross domestic product (GDP) was expected to be constrained by up to 3.3 per cent.  He warned also of threats to gains made in peacebuilding.  The United Nations response  especially though resolutions and establishment of the emergency mission  deserved praise  but stronger capacities to respond were still needed.  With that  he urged the General Assembly to voice its opposition to flight bans and policies that isolated or stigmatized Ebola-affected countries  adding that the United Nations was founded on a mandate to confront human insecurity and not shun it. He promised a continued fight against poverty  with “intense engagement” under the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile and Post-conflict States.  On Security Council reform  he adhered to the African Common Position  calling for remedy to the “historical injustice” of Africa’s poor representation in the Council.  Peace and democracy were being built through the Mano River Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).  Sierra Leone would contribute peacekeepers and support the African Union’s rapid intervention initiative.  Events in several countries were worrying  including transnational crime and terrorism.  He supported measures targeting sexual violence and recruitment of child soldiers.  He welcomed the International Criminal Court’s efforts to achieve judicial accountability  and stressed his commitment to a moratorium on the death penalty as part of support for the Human Rights Council. AUGUSTINE KPEHE NGAFUAN  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Liberia  said President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf had chaired a high-level committee of African Heads of State  and under her leadership  a Common African Position was developed and endorsed by the African Union.  The “CAP”  as it is known  was anchored on six development pillars  including economic growth  science and technology and environmental sustainability.  It represented Africa’s vision for the continent’s future.  He hoped that the substance of those pillars would form an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.  At the same time  he was increasingly concerned about the spread globally of extremist ideologies and terrorist activities  especially in Africa.  Also troubling were the conflicts in South Sudan and the Central African Republic  and he commended efforts by the African Union and the United Nations to resolve them. Concerning Ebola  he said that “deadly enemy” began wreaking havoc in Liberia in March.  Since the outbreak  his Government had taken a host of measures  which included declaring a state of emergency  suspending school and increasing awareness and prevention campaigns.  The latter steps aimed to address the “crystallized denial” and deeply-rooted traditional and cultural practices that created fertile ground for the spread.  Despite those efforts and the help of several health organizations  Ebola had sprinted faster than those collective efforts to defeat it  killing more than 1 800 Liberians and infecting nearly 3 500.  Women  who constituted a majority of the country’s health-care workers and were society’s primary caregivers  had been disproportionately affected.  The situation was creating “a trail of traumatized orphans” across the country  which included a 10-year-old from Barkedu  Lofa County  who was the “last person standing” in a family of 12. The resultant panic that arose from health workers seeing their colleagues die from Ebola had precipitated the closure of many health facilities across the country.  Its public health system  which had collapsed during years of conflict and was being gradually rebuilt  had relapsed under the weight of the deadly virus.  Ebola was not just a health crisis; it was a total crisis — an economic  social  and potentially a political and security crisis.  It had caused a downward slide in the country’s growth  with experts predicting that  if not contained quickly  Ebola would cause a 12 per cent decline in the country’s economy in 2015.  While there had been positive developments in the last few weeks that had helped increase the focus on the virus  the international community must not be complacent.  Preparations to confront the longer term socioeconomic impact of the crisis were critical.  In that connection  he expressed appreciation for the United Nations country team’s focus on the fight and the engagement of the United Nations Mission in Liberia  geared towards long-term development. NICKOLAS STEELE  Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Business of Grenada  said war and insecurity in the information age had burgeoned to the point where the efforts of neither the United Nations nor national armies were enough.  A “new information master plan” for the twenty-first century was needed to reduce the growing inequalities in society and to confront current global challenges.  Global policy should focus on promoting sustainable economic growth through education  information and communications technology.  The World Bank’s 2011 World Development Report on Managing Conflict acknowledged that development agencies were not capable of adequately helping fragile States  and that investing in citizen security  justice and jobs was essential to reducing violence.  “Do we have the courage to be proactive in fostering jobs and growth  or will we wait for violence to erupt?” he asked. Climate shocks were terrifying for Grenada and islands worldwide  he said  acknowledging the Secretary-General’s leadership in calling for a climate summit.  Hurricane Ivan alone had caused economic damage equivalent to 200 per cent of the country’s GDP.  This week  unseasonably high rains had caused numerous landslides.  Like neighbouring Saint Lucia  and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  Grenada had been forced to dedicate scarce financial resources to address such weather events.  There was a link between those events and the high indebtedness of small Caribbean islands  he said  adding that those nations needed “concessionary” financing to ensure growth  jobs and economic development  and to build resilience to the effects of climate change.  Their annual cry for such funding was “the early warning system” for the international community. The renewable energy market was estimated at $12 billion in the Caribbean  he said.  For island States  the most sustainable form of adaptation to climate change was a robust economy combined with sound disaster-management policies.  Renewable energy could be introduced without subsidies.  Island nations contributed the least to greenhouse gas emissions  and were the most cost-effective places for renewable energy.  Grenada was working to transform its electricity sector  he said  adding that solving the energy challenge would remove a drag on Caribbean island economies and better position them to withstand environmental shocks.  His Government had signed a groundbreaking memorandum of understanding with the United States to serve as a pilot country in the region on energy transformation  and one with New Zealand on geothermal energy. The Green Climate Fund must become operational  he said.  He called for the creation of a “window” within the Fund for islands; full reliance on renewable energy in all island States; setting a price on carbon and eliminating subsidies of fossil fuels; and greater support for climate-smart agriculture.  The latter would increase productivity  income and resilience to climate change and reduce or remove carbon emissions.  Having lost 30 per cent of its coral reefs and mangroves in the last 30 years  Grenada was working with the Dutch Government on the Climate-Smart Agriculture Alliance  and welcomed the Global Blue Growth and Food Security Initiative  among other global partnerships.  Blue growth was vital for the tri-island “Ocean State” of Grenada  Carriacou and Petite Martinique — whose exclusive economic zone in the sea was 70 times greater than its land mass. CAMILLO GONSALVES  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  said the United Nations Charter was the “rulebook” that governed international cooperation  its principal rule being that of respect for the sovereign equality of all States.  Certain administrative aspects of the rulebook were “clearly long overdue for meaningful reform” — like the composition and working methods of the “fossilized and increasingly irrelevant Security Council”.  However  the principles that informed the Charter were timeless  and any attempt to deviate from them would constitute an assault on sovereignty  a departure from diplomacy  and an improvisation of international law on the fly.  The loss of sovereignty had never benefited the weak or powerless.  As a small  open and vulnerable State  his country could not accept the suggestion that its existence rested on the whim  generosity or benign neglect of powerful States. Speaking on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  he said that whatever the motivation for the most recent conflict  the underlying problem remained unaddressed and unresolved.  At its root were the invasion  occupation and economic strangulation of Palestine  and the steady  illegal erosion of its internationally established borders.  The unquestionable right of Israel to exist in peace and defend itself  he added  did not give it an unfettered licence to occupy  oppress and suppress the sovereign rights of the Palestinian people.  The absence of borders and disregard for sovereignty threatened to make the concept of a two-State solution nothing more than “feel-good rhetoric with limited applicability on the ground”  he concluded. On climate change  he stressed that despite its “tiny carbon footprint and miniscule emissions”  his country had been repeatedly victimized by weather anomalies  partially caused by the historical and continued environmental abuse by major emitters.  In the past four years  it had experienced a hurricane  a drought and two floods  the loss and damage caused by each of those events resulting in annual double-digit hits to its GDP.  He added that the prospects of genuine progress against climate change became increasingly remote with each passing day of “diplomatic dithering  buck-passing and finger-pointing”.  While the recent Climate Summit had seen some welcome new pledges  the numbers still did not add up to anything close to what was required to cap global warming at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. JAMAL ABDULLAH AL-SALLAL  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Yemen  said his country had signed the Gulf Initiative and had thus begun the process of transition.  It had established a national reconciliation committee as well as a peace committee and had organized presidential elections.  Additionally  the drafting committee for Yemen’s constitution was about to determine its first draft.  Despite great challenges his country faced  it had also signed a new security annex to maintain social cohesion in the country so that people could devote their efforts to the political process.  The international community should continue to support Yemen  and the Security Council must work against parties that might seek to undermine the transitional process in the country. He said Yemen was dealing with major economic challenges  including scarcity of resources.  As host to around a million refugees from countries in the Horn of Africa  it needed economic support and humanitarian assistance.  While Yemen had taken steps to restructure its armed forces and police and had seen an improvement in security  the situation remained fragile.  The country was affected by terrorism  which threatened the region and entire world.  He called on the international community to help his country combat security challenges and cooperate in logistical areas such as training and capacity-building  stressing that Yemen’s stability would contribute to global security. Turning to conflicts elsewhere  he said his country was following the suffering of the Palestinian people  and was concerned with the ongoing cycle of violence in Syria  which had destabilized the region.  He called for a solution that would meet the aspirations of the Syrian people while maintaining the country’s territorial integrity and unity.  Noting the presence of ISIL in Iraq  he said such terrorist groups had nothing to do with Islam or the Muslim community  which respected the rights of all people.  In light of those events around the world  he urged reform of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security  as well as for a permanent seat in the Security Council for Arab States. MOHLABI KENNETH TSEKOA  Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Relations of Lesotho  said Africa was facing a rise in terrorism  with the Nigeria-based Boko Haram  Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb  and Al-Shabaab in Somalia.  The emergence of new extremist groups and terrorist entities such as ISIL in the Middle East and elsewhere  was a stark reminder of the need for collective action to ensure that peoples everywhere enjoyed the right to peace  development and the sanctity of life.  Military action alone to counter terrorism was no longer a panacea  he said  calling for a holistic approach that addressed the root causes. On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  he said that recent developments had cast a shadow on a future that had seemed to hold promise for a negotiated settlement.  Lesotho endorsed the Human Rights Council resolution calling for an independent commission to investigate the massacres of innocent Palestinian civilians.  Those responsible should be held accountable.  It was unfortunate  he added  that in the case of the slaughter of thousands of Palestinian civilians  the Security Council had shied away from invoking the “responsibility to protect” principle and had issued only a presidential statement  which failed to reiterate accountability for the war crimes committed. Concerning the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  he stressed that the challenges remained most daunting in the least-developed  landlocked and small island developing States  as well as countries in or emerging from conflict. Lesotho had made some progress in achieving at least two of the eight Goals  namely universal primary education and the promotion of gender equality and women’s empowerment.  However  it still faced a long and uphill journey  with HIV and AIDS remaining a serious threat.  The post-2015 development agenda must emphasize national ownership and respect national conditions.  Regarding climate change  he called for more easily accessible funds aimed at helping developing countries mitigate and adapt to its impacts. JEAN-PAUL ADAM  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Seychelles  said that despite being one of the smallest nations in the world  the people of Seychelles had always known that they could not be at peace if the world was not at peace.  Global terrorist activities  coupled with a multiplication of regional conflicts and instability  were a reminder of the increasing threat posed by terrorism and the effect on innocent victims.  Building peace meant reinforcing the commitment to multilateralism and prioritizing more inclusive and effective development. In the context of the post-2015 development agenda  he said his country took pride in having achieved the majority of the Millennium Development Goals and was motivated to ensure that the remaining challenges were addressed by 2015.  Although progress was essential for small island developing States  the current development framework was not favourable to that group  he said  noting that the gains were still measured through GDP per capita metrics  which did not sufficiently identify threats to human development or the opportunities that may exist for those small island nations.  Nevertheless  Seychelles welcomed the outcomes of the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States held in Samoa  and thanked the host country for its leadership in establishing a platform for action to support their development. On climate change  he said that Seychelles was preoccupied by the conclusions drawn by the Fifth Assessment Report of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  He stressed that small island developing States had continuously underlined the scientific research being conducted on climate change  warning that 1.5°C would negatively impact all countries.  There was a window  however  to act decisively and effectively  he said  noting that a legally binding agreement which set the course for increases of no more than 2°C was within reach.  He called on all partners to ensure that the upcoming Lima conference set the stage for concluding an agreement in Paris in 2015.  At the same time  he underlined the importance of fulfilling joint commitments to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 for the Green Climate Fund. PATRICE NISBETT  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Kitts and Nevis  said that Millennium Development Goal 8  calling for the strengthening of global partnerships  remained unfinished and must be rendered effective and operational.  His Government believed that achieving sustainable development would require mobilization and effective use of financial resources and technology development and transfer  in addition to capacity-building at all levels.  It would also entail an increased investment in the social sectors  infrastructure  community development  climate financing  and the protection of global common goods.  A strengthened global partnership should foster close collaboration between and among Governments  provide for an increased role for the private sector  ensure a fair international trading regime  and foster national and foreign direct investments. Speaking on small island developing States  he highlighted their susceptibility to economic and environmental shocks  which resulted in high indebtedness.  By the end of June 2014  his country had successfully reduced its debt-to-GDP ratio from over 145 per cent to 95 per cent.  He called for a new paradigm to the assessment of the policy of graduation  which should take into account the peculiar vulnerabilities of those island States.  The graduation to a higher income category made it more difficult to access resources  and borrowing funds at a high rate on the international financial market only perpetuated the vicious cycle of debt and threatened their sustainable development. With his country and the region wrestling with a high incidence of non-communicable diseases  he was pleased to see them included in the post-2015 development agenda.  On climate change  he said that for small island developing States it was not just an environmental concern  but a threat to their existence.  The international community should accept creative initiatives such as debt swap for climate adaptation and mitigation. ROBERT DUSSEY  Minister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Togo  said that the Millennium Development Goals were helpful for humankind  even if all targets would not be achieved.  His Government was determined to continue and scale up the efforts within the framework of the post-2015 agenda  with a commitment to reducing poverty.  There was now a positive outlook for increased success of job-promotion programmes  mainly for the benefit of youths.  Financial institutions were assisting members of society usually excluded from their benefits  particularly women. In health  Togo had registered encouraging results for child and infant mortality rates  and was battling diseases including tuberculosis  he stated.  His country had intensified efforts to protect world heritage through neutralizing networks of trafficking in endangered species.  Togo was all the more certain that the agenda for peace and new architecture for international security must take into account the trend of the regionalization of conflicts.  Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab frequently carried out attacks that destabilized brother countries.  Togo knew too well the value of the efforts made by France to fight alongside African countries.  Those efforts must continue and be strengthened  and the entire international community must spare no effort in their support. He said it was essential that countries further secured their maritime borders as well as eradicate piracy.  African coasts should be a space for international trade  free from organized predators.  Further  the worsening of the situations in various conflict areas throughout the world — in Syria  Libya  Ukraine  Palestine and others — threatened to wipe out whatever development had been achieved.  He reminded the Assembly of the great threat to the international community  especially in West Africa  posed by the Ebola virus.  That was an international threat to peace and security  and greater attention should be paid to the people of Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea to prevent the spread of the disease. MÅRTEN GRUNDITZ (Sweden) said his country had joined collective efforts to tackle ISIL at the request of the Iraqi Government  stressing the importance of political engagement to resolve that issue  as well as conflict in Syria  Iran’s nuclear dossier  and Israel-Palestine negotiations.  He welcomed action on Ebola  noting Sweden’s support to those efforts.  Peacebuilding support had also been given to Somalia and Liberia.  Criticizing “Russian acts of aggression” in Ukraine  he stressed the need for the world to “react resolutely”  particularly given that the attacker was a permanent member of the Security Council.  Greater efforts were needed to fulfil the Millennium Development Goals  and a transformative and universal new framework for sustainable development was needed with a consensus on financing and effective partnerships. Women were essential to development and peace  he said  underlining that gender equality was just and smart economics.  Women needed full sexual and reproductive rights.  Sweden’s economic growth was decoupled from its greenhouse gas emissions  with 60 per cent growth coming despite a 20 per cent reduction in emissions since 1990.  His country had helped initiate the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate and he looked forward to the Paris Summit.  Migration was at its highest level since the Second World War  with more global solidarity needed.  His country would continue to donate 1 per cent of its GDP to ODA and promised continued peacekeeping contributions.  Declaring Sweden’s candidacy for the Security Council  he welcomed the Hammarskjöld Commission’s report on the death of Dag Hammarskjöld. Right of Reply Speaking in exercise of the right of reply  the representative of Iran said that the representative of the Israeli regime had made baseless accusations and distorted passages against his Government  which were designed to defend the atrocities that it had recently committed against a whole civilian population.  That speaker had tried in vain to wash his hands of that most recent bloodbath in Gaza  perpetrated before the eyes of the whole world.  He had rushed to the General Assembly to hopelessly wage another war against the whole Islamic world and civilization  associating them baselessly with the ISIS terrorist group and propagating Iranophobia and Islamophobia.  All of that had been done to the applause of a crowd brought in from outside the United Nations. He said it was ironic that a regime famous for its atrocities  apartheid policies and war crimes could allow itself to accuse other countries in such a sinister way.  It was also preposterous that the same regime with a highly known record of developing  producing and stockpiling different kinds of inhumane weapons  including nuclear weapons  ventured to falsely accuse others of trying to acquire similar weapons.  It was “laughable” for many to hear such a person speak of the atrocities by the ISIS terrorist group when  under his command  there had been an aggression against Gaza in which all international norms and laws were blatantly flouted  leading to the killing of more than 2 000 Palestinian civilians  mostly women and children and the elderly  and rendering more than a half a million people homeless.  Those people had already been living under an inhumane and suffocating Israeli blockade for eight years. Against that backdrop  he said that speaker had claimed to be concerned over the Iranian nuclear program  which was fully peaceful and under international supervision.  Iran and others in the region had the right to worry about nuclear weapons in the hands of a regime that had shown  time and again  its capacity and propensity to kill.  The statement by the Israeli representative was in keeping with its well-known policy to sabotage and disrupt negotiations on Iran’s nuclear programme. Turning to the statement made by the representative of Bahrain  he said the “Persian Gulf” was and had always been the historic and time-honoured toponym for the stretch of water situated between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula.  Historic evidence bore testimony to that fact  and the term was also internationally recognized  including repeatedly by the United Nations.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-09-27,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11564.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Sixty-ninth General Assembly Plenary 15th & 16th Meetings (AM & PM)   Amid growing global tensions and turmoil  fostering neighbourly relations was vital to national development and prosperity and in keeping with the “surge of democracy” spreading throughout the world  the General Assembly heard today as debate continued into the weekend. India’s Prime Minister said his country desired a peaceful and stable environment for its development  as a nation’s destiny was “linked to its neighbourhood”.  He was prepared to engage in a serious bilateral dialogue with Pakistan  without the shadow of terrorism  to promote friendship and cooperation. “Let us bring ourselves in tune with the call of our times ” he continued  pointing out that the world was witnessing tensions and turmoil on a scale rarely seen in recent history  requiring a genuine global partnership.  The Russian Federation’s Foreign Minister  expressing sincere interest in restoring peace in “the neighbouring country”  highlighted the ceasefire agreement signed by the Russian and Ukrainian Presidents  which  he said  had created an opening to resolve the situation. At the same time  he argued that the United States and the European Union supported the coup d’état in Ukraine and that the self-proclaimed Kyiv authorities had opted for suppression of the Ukrainian people  propelling the population of Crimea to take destiny into their own hands in favour of self-determination. In the context of the unparalleled unrest worldwide  several speakers  including from conflict “hot spots”  shared their ongoing struggles for peace and democracy.  Among them was the President of the House of Representatives of Libya  who said that the unarmed revolutionaries and intellectuals who had defeated the dictatorship three years ago had left the political arena. He said the armed coalition known as “Dawn of Libya”  which included a group with Al-Qaida ideology  was trying to impose its will on the Libyan people by force  violating human rights  blackmailing the Government for funds  and aiming to derail his country’s democratic transition. South Sudan’s journey to peace and independence  said its President  had been costly and characterized by marginalization  a prolonged war  human disasters  the loss of millions of lives and untold human suffering.  The youngest nation had already seen violent conflict erupt in December 2013  he added. However  noting his Government’s unwavering commitment to resolving the conflict peacefully  he pointed out that South Sudan’s negotiating team had been in Addis Ababa since January to talk with the rebels in the hope of closing that “dark chapter” in its history.  With the help of mediators  his Government had signed a cessation agreement  but the rebels had refused to do so. The Transitional Head of State of the Central African Republic said political instability and internal conflict had plunged the nation into a state of extreme vulnerability.  However  following the resignation of her predecessor in January  her Administration represented a radical break from the past.  With firm determination  she had embarked on efforts to restore security and peace  address the humanitarian crisis  foster economic growth  and ensure free  transparent elections.  Her plea for global support did not “fall on deaf ears”  she said. Also high on the agenda of today’s debate were the impacts of climate change on small island developing States.  Tuvalu’s Prime Minister wondered if leaders “really cared”.  To the “deniers” of climate change  he said that the security and future human rights of its citizens were “seriously compromised”  as the country was only two to three meters above sea level.  He called for action by the international community to halt climate change  urging it to “save us”. Supporting calls to address the adverse impacts of climate change  the King of Tonga said his country was a custodian of the Pacific Ocean  whose natural resources were the “bedrock” of the islands’ economic  social and environmental development.  The well-being of the Tongan people  he stressed  was premised on the sustainable development  management and conservation of that ocean. Similarly  Fiji’s Prime Minister urged more concerted efforts to confront the enormous challenges to the Pacific region  namely population growth and the unsustainable use of ocean resources.  History would judge the world’s major carbon emitters extremely harshly unless they took “immediate and comprehensive” steps to reduce emissions  he declared. Heads of State and Government of Mali and Bangladesh also spoke. Also participating were Ministers and other Government officials from Burundi  Thailand  Germany  China  San Marino  United Arab Emirates  Cuba  Austria  Andorra  Viet Nam  Greece  Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  Algeria  Mozambique  Portugal  Czech Republic  Jamaica and Afghanistan. Speaking in exercise of the right of reply were representatives of Iran  Pakistan and India. The general debate will continue at 9 a.m. Monday  29 September. Statements TUPOU VI  King of Tonga  said that  in order to guarantee a harmonious implementation of the post-2015 development agenda  each country should take primary responsibility for its own economic growth  social development and environmental sustainability.  However  that could only be fully realized with the active engagement of all relevant stakeholders through genuine and durable partnerships.  In that regard  he looked forward to working with the international community towards adopting the post-2015 development agenda. This year  the Pacific Island leaders had endorsed the Palau Declaration entitled “The Ocean:  Life & Future  Charting a Course to Sustainability”  he said.  Tonga was a joint custodian of the Pacific Ocean  whose natural resources were the bedrock of Pacific Island economic  social and environmental development.  The well-being of the Tongan people was  therefore  premised on the sustainable development  management and conservation of that ocean and its resources. He said the management of seabed exploration and exploitation was an important facet of Tonga’s interests in the oceans.  The Government had worked diligently through the relevant institutions established under the Convention on the Law of the Sea to ensure that activity within the Pacific Ocean was managed appropriately and for the benefit of all humankind.  For the first time  Tonga was seeking election to the Council of the International Seabed Authority. He commended the Secretary-General’s initiative to convene the Climate Change Summit and deliver bold announcements on Climate Change mitigation and adaptation.  Supporting calls to address the adverse impacts of climate change  he said responses must be based upon the principles of equity and of common  but differentiated responsibility.  He underscored that the 2013 World Risk Report ranked Tonga as the second most vulnerable country in the world to natural disasters. He also appealed for a meaningful approach that went beyond rhetoric to reform the Security Council  so that it would be more representative and inclusive  through an intergovernmental process.  For future generations to live in a better world  the international community must work harmoniously to fulfil its responsibility and seek “the Almighty God” to give guidance through the rising challenges. IBRAHIM BOUBACAR KEITA  President of Mali  said that  at the 2012 Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio  Member States had sought to offer a better world for future generations.  The “future we want” was feasible  but the international community faced a critical task of formulating the post-2015 development agenda.  The current session’s theme  “Delivering on and Implementing a Transformative Post-2015 Development Agenda”  integrated all components of the Millennium Development Goals and sustainable development goals.  Eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 should be a priority in the new development framework.  In that regard  he urged the international community to carefully and diligently review and support the African Common Position. With the critical year of 2015 approaching  Africa had been confronted with the outbreak of Ebola  he said.  The scale of that new challenge required doubling efforts and resources.  He had shared last year his resolve to turn Mali into a free democratic nation and write a new page in its history.  The 18 June Ouagadougou Accord was a significant development in the political and security arenas  establishing a central Government  as well as the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) mandate.  His Government had identified structural weaknesses  such as poor governance and corruption and an open forum had been created on decentralization.  Under the auspices of Algeria and other partners  inter-Malian dialogue on comprehensive and lasting peace was under way  with an eye towards entering the final process towards signing a peace agreement with the armed groups. Terrorist attacks were on the rise in Libya  Nigeria  Kenya  Uganda  Tunisia and the Middle East  he said  expressing regret that terrorism was taking root under the name of religion.  The Malian crisis in 2012 had led to the adoption of the United Nations Integrated Strategy for the Sahel.  Ministers for Foreign Affairs in the region had decided to meet every six months.  At the second meeting in Bamako on 16 May  the Malian Road Map had been adopted.  He also expressed concern about extremists in Syria and Iraq  particularly the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)  calling for the implementation of relevant United Nations resolutions.  His country was committed to cutting the flow of illegal light and small weapons  a factor contributing to violence.  The Arms Trade Treaty as a genuine step forward. Although the topic of Security Council reform had been on the agenda for two decades  no progress had been made  he pointed out.  Issues at stake concerned veto power  equitable regional representation  expansion of membership  and the Council’s relations with the General Assembly.  Africa  consisting of 53 States  was the only continent that did not have a permanent seat.  That ran counter to the Organization’s principles of equality and justice.  His country had proposed two permanent seats with veto power and five non-permanent seats for Africa. SALVA KIIR  President of South Sudan  said the journey of his people from conflict to peace and for independence and freedom had been costly and characterized by marginalization  a prolonged war  human disasters  loss of millions of lives and untold human suffering.  At its independence  his country had been faced with an inadequate infrastructure  limited human capacity and weak security. Recalling the violent conflict that erupted in his country in December 2013  he said his Government was unwaveringly committed to resolving conflict peacefully.  The country’s negotiating team had been in Addis Ababa since January of this year to talk to rebels in order to close that dark chapter in the history of the young country.  With the help of mediators  a cessation agreement had been signed by his Government  which reaffirmed its commitment in this past May.  However  rebels had violated it too many times and had refused to sign the document.  The international community  he stressed  must urge the rebels to sign the protocol to the agreement. He said the conflict in South Sudan was purely a struggle for power and not an ethnic conflict as had been reported.  Citizens displaced by conflict had sought refuge in neighbouring States and in the neighbouring countries.  Those innocent victims of conflict urgently needed and deserved human assistance.  In that regard  he expressed thanks to the Government of Norway for organizing a donor conference to support his country’s humanitarian needs and to the United Nations for having organized a high-level ministerial meeting in the same regard. The conflicts within both South Sudan and Sudan tended to be interconnected  he pointed out.  For that reason  the people of South Sudan would exert more efforts in strengthening their country’s relationship with Sudan and to resolve issues through dialogue. Turning to the United Nations Advance Mission in the Sudan  he said his Government was collaborating with the Mission and other stakeholders to build trust with the internally displaced persons in the Mission’s camp  so that they could return to their homes and conflict-free areas and resume their normal lives.  However  expressing concern with the mandate of the Advance Mission  he requested the United Nations reconsider its mandate during the renewal of the mandate period in November. CATHERINE SAMBA-PANZA  Transitional Head of State of the Central African Republic  said that the current session was taking place while her country was in a difficult situation  which was of interest to all Member States.  Political instability and internal conflicts had plunged the Central African Republic into a state of extreme vulnerability.  The country had been shaken and its people were facing tragic situations.  In January 2014  her predecessor resigned.  Her leadership gave rise to hope.  She was the first female Head of State  representing a radical break from the past.  With firm determination  she had set out to address the nation’s challenges  embarking on efforts to restore security and peace  address the humanitarian crisis  launch activities that fostered economic growth  and ensure the convening of free  transparent elections. Her call for international support for her transitional Government had not fallen on deaf ears  she said  welcoming Security Council resolution 2147 (2014)  which had established the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA).  Since 15 September  authority had been transferred from the African-led International Support Mission to the Central African Republic (MISCA) to MINUSCA.  The success of that transition depended upon the involvement of national security forces.  Disarmament  demobilization and reintegration would require substantial international support. On the humanitarian front  she said that the number of internally displaced persons had dropped; 81 per cent had left the camps and returned to their communities.  Yet  the situation was generally concerning as it hinged on fragile security.  The conflict had cut the country’s economic growth rate by 36 per cent in 2013  plunging it into recession.  She expressed hope that the agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on rapid disbursement of funds would put the country on a path of growth.  On the political front  she had focused on “disarming hearts and minds” through national reconciliation.  The Ebola outbreak and the spread of Boko Haram and the Lord’s Resistance Army  or LRA  terrorist groups in neighbouring Nigeria and Cameroon were also worrying. She supported efforts to cut the illegal flow of small arms and light weapons and expressed commitment to fight impunity  noting that her country was a party to the Rome Statute.  She also supported the effort of France and Mexico to limit the veto power in the Council in cases concerning such serious crimes as genocide.  On climate change  she urged Member States to ratify the Doha amendment to the Kyoto Protocol.  Her country backed Morocco on the question of Western Sahara. PROSPER BAZOMBANZA  Vice-President of Burundi  said the Millennium Development Goals had formed a pact of global solidarity in the economic and social fields.  While countries had varying experiences  it would be wrong to abandon the Goals and to start from scratch.  Continued reform must be pursued  especially in areas that had led to unprecedented progress.  That approach would help to define the objectives for the post-2015 development agenda.  Despite challenges  his country had made undeniable progress in the areas of education and health care  especially as they related to young girls and women. His Government was preparing for the upcoming presidential and general elections  scheduled to begin in May 2015  he said.  Owing to the adoption of a road map for the various political parties  the elections should be transparent  free and democratic.  Parliament already had adopted the electoral code.  The Independent National Electoral Commission announced the elections schedule last June.  Among his Government’s efforts towards good governance was a law passed by Parliament to set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission under the 2000 Arusha Agreement.  Consultations were under way for the election of its 11 commissioners.  In addition  an ad hoc committee for the selection of candidates had been established by general consensus. As for the consolidation of aid to Burundi  he noted that the mandate of the United Nations Office in Burundi would complete its term on 31 December of this year  and responsibility would be transferred to the United Nations Country Team.  The Joint Transition Programme was presented to the authorized body in May  in the Burundi offices.  A joint steering committee and a technical transition team had taken office. On economic affairs  he said Burundi held two industry conferences in 2013 on priority areas  which produced mixed results.  In that regard  he appealed to partners represented in the Assembly to honour the commitments made at the 2012 conference in Geneva.  After 2015  Burundi would focus on good governance  inequality  economic growth and employment  access to basic social services and food security  and redouble its efforts to safeguard the principles of the Millennium Declaration. NARENDRA MODI  Prime Minister of India  noted that there was a surge of democracy across the world.  Afghanistan was at a historic moment of democratic transition and affirmation of unity.  Nepal had moved from violence to peace and democracy.  Bhutan’s young democracy was flourishing.  Democracy was trying to find a voice in West Asia and North Africa  with Tunisia’s success demonstrating it was possible.  There was a new stirring for stability and progress in Africa and unprecedented spread of prosperity in Asia and beyond.  Latin America was coming together in shared pursuit of stability and prosperity.  As well  India desired a peaceful and stable environment for its development  as a nation’s destiny was linked to its “neighbourhood”. He said he was prepared to engage in a serious bilateral dialogue with Pakistan in a peaceful atmosphere  without the shadow of terrorism  to promote friendship and cooperation.  Pakistan must also take its responsibility to create an appropriate environment.  Raising issues in the General Assembly was not the way to make progress towards resolving bilateral issues.  Instead  both sides should be thinking about the victims of floods in Jammu and Kashmir.  India had organized massive flood relief operations and had offered assistance for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. “Let us bring ourselves in tune with the call of our times ” he said  pointing out that the world was witnessing tensions and turmoil on a scale rarely seen in recent history.  No one country or group of countries could determine the course of the world.  There had to be a genuine global partnership.  That was not just a moral position  but a practical reality.  Putting aside differences  Member States should mount a concerted effort to combat terrorism and extremism  he said  urging them to adopt the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.  Furthermore  the international community must pursue a more stable and inclusive global development.  Globalization had created new poles of growth  yet billions of people still lived on the edge of poverty. He highlighted the need to change people’s lifestyles to create a more habitable and sustainable world  and in that regard  he said he believed that yoga could help.  Yoga embodied unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfilment; harmony between man and nature; a holistic approach to health and well-being.  It was not about exercise  but about discovering the sense of oneness with self  the world and the nature.  “By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness  it can help us deal with climate change ” he said  urging delegates to adopt an International Yoga Day. SHEIKH HASINA  Prime Minister of Bangladesh  said that a global order based on peaceful coexistence  social justice and freedom from poverty  hunger  exploitation and justice continued to be her country’s guiding vision in its national development and its engagement with the world.  She expressed her Government’s full solidarity with the Palestinian people.  Bangladesh had so far contributed 128 133 peacekeepers to 54 United Nations peacekeeping missions  as the highest number of women police officers to those operations. Her Government had created a strong legal and regulatory regime for countering terrorism  she said  adding that  in order to uphold the rule of law and end impunity  crimes committed during the 1971 “liberation war” were being brought to trial.  The Bangladeshi economy had grown during the last five years  and several infrastructure and connectivity projects were being brought to fruition.  Eighteen “economic zones” were being established across the country for potential investors.  With a young workforce  skills development of its population remained a policy imperative for Bangladesh.  By making use of contemporary communication technology  the country was reaching both rural and urban people with crucial public services. Having made strides in education  Bangladesh had reached the Millennium Development Goal of ensuring universal primary school enrolment  offering students a free education up to the twelfth grade.  Sustainable development entailed women’s equal participation in all parts of life.  Bangladesh’s efforts to promote women’s empowerment were showing results.  A percentage of posts in the judicial  administrative  civil service  armed forces and law enforcement agencies were reserved for women  as were 60 per cent of primary school teacher posts.  Implementation of the Millennium Development Goals had been “uneven” and “unequal” among countries and regions  she said  noting that the eradication of poverty must remain at the centre of the post-2015 development agenda. Further  the agenda had to meaningfully address the long-standing resource and capacity constraints of low-income developing countries  she said.  No challenge was as formidable as climate change to a country like Bangladesh  where a one-metre rise in the sea-level would submerge a fifth of the country and turn 30 million people into “climate migrants”.  Her country  therefore  had a “crucial need” for adequate  predictable climate financing.  There was untapped potential in the “blue economy”  which would allow coastal and small island developing States to benefit through utilization of marine ecosystems and resources  and her country  therefore  supported its incorporation into the post-2015 framework. JOSAIA V. BAINIMARAMA  Prime Minister of Fiji  said it was his honour to inform the General Assembly that his country had kept its promise to introduce genuine democracy.  He stood at the podium today as the first duly elected Prime Minister under the new Constitution  which replaced three previous Constitutions since independence from Britain in 1970.  For nearly four decades  Fiji had laboured under a system that was undemocratic  unjust and unfair.  The former  weighted system had perpetuated injustice for a great many people  creating different classes of citizens and encouraging corruption.  However  with a series of reforms  the nation had been transformed. Every Fijian now enjoyed equal opportunity and a common Fijian identity  he said.  That designation  once reserved for the indigenous majority  now applied to everyone from the Republic of Fiji  just as “American” applies to all from the United States  or “Australian” to people from Australia.  Today  Fiji was a fairer  more just and more compassionate society  and was stepping up efforts to alleviate poverty on the back of a rapidly strengthening economy. Fiji’s journey since independence had been long and sometimes traumatic  he said.  There had been four coups  a rebellion  four Constitutions and 56 ”days of shame” in 2000  when members of the Parliament had been held hostage.  However  with the recent election  Fijians had put that era firmly behind them.  The country was currently enjoying the most sustained period of economic growth in its history  and the possibility to create more jobs and raise the living standards of the people had never been greater. In this International Year of the Small Island Developing States  he said more concerted efforts were necessary to strengthen regional institutions to confront the enormous challenges faced in the Pacific region  namely population growth and unsustainable use of ocean resources.  History would judge the world’s major carbon emitters extremely harshly unless they took immediate and comprehensive steps to reduce emissions. ENELE SOSENE SOPOAGA  Prime Minister of Tuvalu  noting his country was celebrating its thirty-sixth anniversary of independence next week  said his country was proud and committed to be a Member State of the United Nations.  However  he voiced sadness for the loss of lives and suffering of fellow human beings from crises the world over.  Such losses  due to terrorism  poverty and environmental degradation  Ebola  as well as political conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine  were disturbing. He said he wondered if leaders “really cared”  and if they meant what they said inside the General Assembly Hall.  A kindergartener recently asked him  “do we have a tomorrow  and can you save us?”  Yet  he had mixed feelings.  He was encouraged by the Climate Change Summit  but discouraged by the deniers of climate change.  The world must not be distracted by those deniers  but must focus on a strategic and pragmatic approach. There was a lot of talk within the United Nations about creating a post-2015 development agenda  he observed  stressing that diverse circumstances and needs of the United Nations membership should be taken into account in its development.  The Organization must also improve its presence  particularly in vulnerable States  as global realities affected even the farthest  most remote island countries like Tuvalu.  The dedication of this year as the International Year for Small Island Developing States had concluded in many constructive partnerships to address the special needs of those States.  Commending those efforts  he also believed that the ultimate measure of success was the delivery of tangible actions on the ground that reflected and accommodated each unique and special place. Juxtaposing Tuvalu’s 24 square kilometres of land against its 900 000 square kilometres of the Pacific Ocean  he said the sea had always been the “lifeline” for food and economic growth for his people.  The United Nations should honour the health of the ocean  as it was the earth’s life support system.  The seriousness and urgency of actions needed to combat climate change had also been echoed by youth leaders in the General Assembly.  Tuvalu was experiencing unprecedented life-threatening impacts from climate change.  At only two to three metres above sea-level  his country’s security and the future human rights of its citizens was being seriously compromised.  Calling for the international community to take action to halt climate change  he stated  “Do it.  Save us.” AGILA SALEH ESSA GWAIDER  President of the House of Representatives of Libya  said that seeing the current fighting in his country  many might wonder where the unarmed revolutionaries of three years ago had gone  and ask “where are the intellectuals who flooded the media and convinced the world of the justice of their people’s cause?”  They were the true Libyan people.  But unfortunately  most of the activists had left the political arena  and armed groups were trying to impose their will on the Libyan people by force  violating people’s human rights  and blackmailing the Government for funds. The armed groups were a coalition known as “Dawn of Libya”  and included a group with Al-Qaida ideology that had been placed on the list of terrorist groups by the United States and the European Union  he said.  Those groups aimed to derail Libya’s democratic transition.  The international community had to stand with the elected legitimate authorities and implement United Nations Security Council resolution 2174 (2014) by imposing sanctions on those hindering the political process and undermining security.  Not to do so would equal stating very clearly that Libyans had to face terrorism alone  he said. The international community’s failure to provide arms and training to the Libyan army in its war against terrorism would negatively affect the stability of the region  ultimately threatening world peace  he continued.  Welcoming all efforts by “friendly countries”  he noted that illegitimate contact  unauthorized by the Government  would be considered an unfriendly act against the unity of Libya and its stability.  Libya’s House of Representatives and Government were determined to pursue the path of dialogue and tolerance in the framework of legitimacy to solve the problems and differences between Libyans. His Government was calling on the international community to help in State-building so that it could “monopolize” the legitimate use of force  and ensure control over the capital  Tripoli.  The international community should also establish a “genuine and active” alliance between Libya and its neighbouring countries  both south and north of the Mediterranean  to cooperate in combating terrorism.  The initiation of a comprehensive dialogue for all Libyan people  with the help of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya  the Arab League and the African Union  was also requested.  Restoring security and stability in Libya was key to making further progress on the Millennium Development Goals. TANASAK PATIMAPRAGORN  Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Thailand  said that development was not just about gross domestic product.  To be sustainable  development must go hand-in-hand with democracy  human rights and peace and security — the pillars of the United Nations.  It also must be allowed to grow in an environment free from conflict.  His country had learned the lesson that democracy was more than elections.  Rather  it must be based on respect for the rule of law  and it must be about good governance  transparency  accountability and equal access to justice.  That had not been the case before 22 May  where there had been a dysfunctional democracy and the real possibility of bloodshed. He said that situation had made a military intervention necessary.  But his country was not retreating from democracy; it just needed time and space to bring about reconciliation  undertake political reforms and strengthen democratic institutions.  The Thai Government was committed to playing an active role in building an Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) community of peace and prosperity and to addressing the many global challenges  such as climate change  transnational crime  pandemics  and human trafficking. Some nations might have the capacity to do more than others  he suggested  but if all did their part  then the world would be better and safer.  That was why Thailand had sent volunteers to its neighbouring countries to work in health and education.  It also had sent medical teams to Japan in 2011 as part of the relief efforts following the earthquake and tsunami.  Thailand had submitted its candidature for a seat on the Human Rights Council for 2015-2017 and the Security Council for 2017-2018  he said  calling for support. FRANK-WALTER STEINMEIER  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany  said that 2014 was a special year for Europe  as it included commemorations of the hundredth anniversary of the commencement of the First World War  the seventy-fifth anniversary of Germany attacking Poland  the prelude to the Second World War  and the twenty-fifth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall  which had brought an end to the world’s decades-long division into East and West.  The world needed to ask itself what it had learned from those experiences.  The establishment of the United Nations was the most important lesson that history taught.  However  it was not enough simply to “call for the United Nations”; it was not a forum to shrug responsibility onto  but a forum through which responsibility was assumed. Germany was prepared to take on responsibility in and with the United Nations  he said.  Next month  a conference would be hosted in Berlin to mobilize urgently needed assistance for millions of Syrian refugees.  Syria’s neighbours were under tremendous strain from the huge influx of displaced people.  Because the Ebola crisis was endangering the cohesion of entire societies in West Africa  Germany was sending humanitarian and medical assistance.  Long-term commitment under the World Health Organization’s (WHO) expertise and the United Nations coordinating umbrella was needed to deal with the crisis. Some delegations might regard the ongoing conflict in Ukraine as nothing more than a regional conflict in Eastern Europe  he went on to say.  But the conflict was much more than that.  The conflict affected “each and every one of us” because a permanent member of the Security Council had  with its annexation of Crimea  “unilaterally changed existing borders in Europe and thus broken international law”.  The power of international law could not be allowed to erode from the inside.  As long as the Russian Federation and the West remained in conflict over Ukraine  the United Nations was threatened with paralysis.  Turning to other issues  he said that the international community also had to tackle the “huge tasks” of the twenty-first century  namely the fight against climate change  privacy in the digital age  and the post-2015 development agenda.  His country  for its part  had shifted towards using renewable energies.  Germany had also taken initiative on the issue of digital privacy by introducing a resolution on the right to privacy in the digital age.  The United Nations  he emphasized  was “worth every effort”  for in it lived the world’s hope for peace and a legal order. SERGEY V. LAVROV  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation  said that the United States-led Western alliance that portrayed itself as a champion of democracy in fact acted from the direct opposite position and rejected the democratic principle of sovereign equality of States.  That alliance was trying to decide for everyone what was good and what was evil.  The United States Administration had openly declared what it believed to be its right to unilateral use of force anywhere to uphold its own interests.  Military interference had become the norm. The sustainability of the international system had been severely shaken by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) bombardment of the then-Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  intervention in Iraq  attacks against Libya and the failure of operations in Afghanistan  he said.  It was only due to diplomatic efforts that the aggression against Syria was prevented in 2013.  There was an impression that the goal of various “colour revolutions” and other projects to change unsuitable regimes was to provoke chaos and instability.  Today  Ukraine had fallen victim to such an arrogant policy.  The situation there had revealed the remaining deep-rooted systemic flaws of the existing architecture in the Euro-Atlantic area.  The West had embarked upon the course towards “vertical structuring of humanity”  tailored to its own “hardly inoffensive” standards. The United States and the European Union supported the coup d’état in Ukraine and reverted to outright justification of any acts by the self-proclaimed Kyiv authorities  he said.  Those authorities had opted for suppression by force of the Ukrainian people  who had rejected attempts to impose an unconstitutional way of life on the entire country  and who wanted to defend their rights to their native language and culture.  It was precisely the aggressive assault on those rights that propelled the population of Crimea to take destiny into its own hands and make a choice in favour of self-determination.  Attempts to distort the truth and to hide the facts behind “blanket accusations” had been undertaken at all stages of the Ukrainian crisis.  The Russian Federation was sincerely interested in restoring peace in “the neighbouring country”.  The ceasefire agreement signed by Presidents Petro Poroshenko and Vladimir Putin had created an opening to resolve the situation. As a condition for establishing diplomatic relations with the then-Soviet Union in 1933  the United States Government had demanded that Moscow guarantee non-interference in the United States’ domestic affairs and not take any actions aimed at changing the United States’ political or social order  he said.  At that time  Washington  D.C.  feared a “revolutionary virus”  and the guarantees it sought were put on record  on the basis of reciprocity.  Perhaps  it now made sense to return to that topic and reproduce that demand of the United States Government on a universal scale.  The policy of ultimatums and the philosophy of supremacy and domination did not meet the requirements of the twenty-first century  and ran counter to the objective process of development of a polycentric  democratic world order. After commenting on various conflicts throughout the world  he noted that the United Nations had been established on the ruins of the Second World War  and was entering the year of its seventieth anniversary.  Everyone in the international community was obligated to celebrate in an appropriate manner and pay tribute to all who had died for freedom and the right of people to determine their own destiny. WANG YI  Minister for Foreign Affairs of China  noted the number of important anniversaries this year  including the outbreak of the First World War and the seventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War.  In China alone  more than 35 million Chinese soldiers and civilians had been left dead or injured by Japanese militarists.  The United Nations had been established to keep the “scourge” of those wars from happening again  and the Charter had laid out the vision of building a better world.  People should treat each other as equals  the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity must be upheld  and different countries’ pursuit of economic and social development had to be respected  he said. However  the world was far from peaceful  he said  mentioning conflicts in Gaza  Iraq  the Central African Republic and in South Sudan.  Countries that placed their domestic law above international law  or even sought regime change  would have their legitimacy questioned by the international community.  In observing international law  he underscored that Chapter VII of the Charter was not the only means for the Security Council to maintain international peace and security.  Better and fuller use should be made of the means of prevention  mediation and conciliation  as stipulated in Chapter VI. Turning to the situation in specific countries  he detailed his Government’s concerns regarding Ukraine  Iraq  Syria  South Sudan  and Afghanistan  as well as the Palestinian issue  the situation on the Korean peninsula and the Iranian nuclear issue.  On the subject of terrorism  he noted that the international community should take new measures to address new threats  focusing on combating religious extremism as well as cyber-terrorism  and stressed that there should be a global effort to “crack down hard and effectively” on the use of the Internet and other new means of communication by terrorists in recruitment  financing and plotting of terrorist attacks. The Millennium Development Goals had contributed greatly to human survival  he said.  The post-2015 development agenda should have three goals  including a focus on poverty eradication  promoting inclusiveness  and ensuring implementation.  On the common challenge of climate change  his Government believed that all parties should work for the conclusion of negotiations by the end of 2015.  The new post-2020 climate change regime should be in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities to ensure a fairer and more effective arrangement for international cooperation on climate change. PASQUALE VALENTINI  Minister for Foreign and Political Affairs of San Marino  said the often dramatic effects of climate change were one of the most serious threats to the future of humanity and a challenge that all States must face with commitment and determination.  The international community must also respond urgently and efficiently to the threat of a global outbreak posed by Ebola  which was engulfing some West African States. Turning to conflicts across the globe  he said his country condemned the commission in all parties in Syria of violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law.  Concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  his Government had launched appeals to both parties to silence their guns and resort to dialogue  recognizing that that was the only way to achieve a peaceful coexistence.  As for the situation in Iraq  where ethnic and religious cleansing was ongoing and carried out with unprecedented violence  he expressed hope that interventions be coordinated under the United Nations’ auspices. He also called attention to migration issues caused by the war that was being fought in some parts of North Africa  as well as the massacre of migrants from Africa to Asia and in the Mediterranean.  The crisis in Ukraine  he added  not only represented a serious threat to peace and security  but also had called into question the fundamental principles of territorial sovereignty and self-determination.  In light of those events  he urged the international community to enable the United Nations to intervene to protect the people and peacefully resolve disputes among States. On both the Millennium Development Goals and the post-2015 development agenda  he said it was critical for all States to recognize the importance of the “family unit” in building a culture of inclusion for that was where primary relationships were developed. SHEIKH ABDULLAH BIN ZAYED AL NAHYAN  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates  denounced terrorist organizations and their commission of brutal  criminal acts in the name of Islam.  Islam rejected such crimes as inconsistent with its moderate approach and principled position on the peaceful coexistence of all peoples.  The increased incidence of terrorism and extremism in the region  especially that perpetrated by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS)  posed threats beyond borders.  The current collective action to confront the threat of ISIS and other terrorist groups reflected the common conviction that the imminent danger must be addressed.  In short  civilized communities must succeed in eliminating the threat. He also expressed concern at the deteriorating security conditions in Libya and their repercussions on the stability of neighbouring countries  and noted with alarm ISIS’s exploitation of the sectarian practices of the former Iraqi Government; it was threatening Iraq’s sovereignty and exploiting the chaos in Syria to achieve its purposes  without regard for sovereignty or national borders.  He called on the international community to take comprehensive measures to fight terrorist groups through a clear  unified strategy  including in all locations  wherever they existed.  Support for Governments facing security challenges was also of critical importance.  His country was building capacities and exchanging best practices on the issue  and was developing national policies to deter and eradicate the roots of terrorism. The lack of tangible outcomes from negotiations between Palestine and Israel was disappointing  he said  condemning Israel’s aggression.  He rejected the continued occupation of three of his country’s islands by Iran  calling on the international community to urge that country to respond to his calls for a just settlement.  At the same time  he welcomed the ongoing negotiations to find a comprehensive settlement of Iran’s nuclear programme  while also noting the important role of nuclear energy in meeting the world’s energy demands.  The United Arab Emirates was a successful model of the use of nuclear energy in a way that was transparent  safe and secure.  On the post-2015 development agenda  he supported sustainable energy for all  and  among other things  gender equality and women’s empowerment.  His country’s achievements in the latter area gave it a prominent place among nations.  He also urged all parties to abide by climate change agreements  with developed countries taking the lead. BRUNO RODRÍGUEZ PARRILLA  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba  called for an end to the foreign intervention in Syria.  He said it was “inconceivable” that western Powers encouraged  financed and armed terrorist groups to pit them against one State  while attempting to combat those groups’ crimes in another  as was being seen in Iraq.  The United States Government was infringing upon international law by launching unilateral bombings with complete disregard for national borders or the sovereignty of States  with “doubtful” coalitions.  He also warned that the attempt to deploy the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to Russian borders would have serious consequences for Europe’s stability  and pursuant to that  called the sanctions against the Russian Federation “immoral and unjust”. Concerning small island developing States  he said that the Havana Summit had recognized that they  including the Caribbean nations  had been hit hard by the current economic  financial and environmental crisis.  He added that their efforts to enhance the living standards of their peoples should not be punished by classifying the country as “middle-income” based on the schematic estimation of per capita incomes  which overlooked their peculiarities and vulnerabilities. Speaking on the blockade  he said that the United States State Department had again included Cuba in its unilateral and arbitrary list of State sponsors of international terrorism.  Its true purpose  he added  was to increase the persecution of his country  constraining international financial transactions and justifying the blockade.  Under the present United States Administration  there had been an unprecedented tightening of the blockade’s “extra-territorial” character  with a “remarkable and unheard-of” emphasis on financial transactions through the imposition of multi-million dollar fines on the banking institutions of third countries. SEBASTIAN KURZ  Federal Minister for Europe  Integration and Foreign Affairs of Austria  said that the crisis in Ukraine was the most serious challenge to peace and security that Europe had faced in decades.  It was unacceptable that international law had been breached and that established borders had been challenged in Europe once again.  A ceasefire would not be enough; a lasting political solution resulting in a free  stable and united Ukraine was needed.  There must not be a return to a divisive  cold-war mentality.  Instead  progress must be made from a policy of “either Europe or Russia” to one of “both Europe and Russia”. Looking beyond Europe  the world was witnessing a rise in extremism in the name of religion  he said.  On that issue  there was no time to lose; the events unfolding in Iraq must be addressed  as the so-called “Islamic State” was attempting to eliminate entire religious communities with the aid of a new phenomenon: foreign fighters.  Thousands held European passports and benefited from global communication and financing networks  he noted.  All had a duty to develop preventive measures to stop the flow of foreign terrorist fighters and cut off their financial support  he urged  adding that the adoption of the Security Council resolution on this issue was an important first step.  Turning to the post-2015 development goals  he noted that Vienna was fully behind the new agenda.  However  it must be ensured that respect for human rights and the rule of law received adequate attention.  Only in societies that respected their citizens’ rights would individual potential be able to thrive.  For that reason  Austria was honoured to be hosting the Second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries in November.  The country was also proud to host a United Nations Office in its capital  and to support the Organization through its membership in the Human Rights Council  presidency of the Economic and Social Council  and peacekeeping contributions. ANTONI MARTÍ PETIT  Head of Government of Andorra  said that this year marked 100 years since the beginning of the First World War.  Countries’ foreign activities  focused exclusively on national interests  had proven to be the cause of conflicts  with the two World Wars highlighting the need for a global order to ensure peace and security.  He went on to say that the situations in Palestine and Ukraine would not be resolved with a partial or short-term perspective.  Any solution that steered away from the United Nations founding principles would be unstable  and would only lead to a new conflict. He said that the appearance of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq required urgent attention.  There could be no justification for the group’s criminal acts of barbarism and terrorism  for murdering innocent people in cold blood.  Nor was there room for inaction or impunity  and with that  he urged the international community to respond to the threat of foreign combatants. Speaking on the essential role of education  he highlighted the need for a vision that integrated long-term thinking.  The only way to achieve global awareness of the United Nations values was through education  which he called the best “weapon against hate and violence”.  His Government prioritized education in its activities at home and abroad  and was proud of its participation in the Global Education First Initiative.  Noting the two-fold focus on education  local and global  he said that cooperation among States strengthened the quality of education systems. Concerning climate change  he spoke about his country’s first-hand experience of its effects  with global warming jeopardizing its tourism sector.  His Government was working with its citizens through education  awareness-raising and policies to reduce the climate impact.  But that was not enough  he warned.  National environmental policies were important  but to limit carbon dioxide emissions  there must be a global commitment and an effective implementation of all pledges.  The international community had a year to prepare for the Paris conference and to mobilize its efforts  he concluded. PHAM BINH MINH  Deputy Prime Minister of Viet Nam  said peace and security were prerequisites for sustainable development  and establishing it was an urgent task that required long-term engagement.  Respect for international law was the foundation of peace  security and stability for sustainability.  All nations should renounce the use of force as an option in international relations and settle disputes by peaceful means.  In that context  he looked forward to substantive progress in peace negotiations on the Middle East  recognizing the fundamental national rights of the Palestinian people  and noting his concern over escalating violence in Iraq.  Condemning all acts of terror  he criticized unilateral economic sanctions against developing countries  such as Cuba. Calling for completion of the Millennium Development Goals by their target date  he said the post-2015 development agenda should add momentum to sustainable development in each country and encourage economic linkages.  More United Nations actions and resources should be brought to bear to address social injustices and inequalities and stronger support was needed for regional and subregional programmes on issues like connectivity  poverty reduction  and the green economy.  The United Nations had to adapt itself to a changing world through accelerated reform  particularly of the Security Council’s membership and working methods.  He was committed to resolving the East Sea (South China Sea) issue peacefully  abiding by the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and working for early adoption of the Code of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.  He supported strengthening multilateral trade  welcoming efforts to enhance economic links and to reform global trade governance for better equality  democracy  transparency and efficiency.  Work continued to establish an ASEAN community with common rules and norms and cooperation on economic  political-security  and sociocultural matters.  Viet Nam participated in the Human Rights Council and United Nations peacekeeping in South Sudan  and was a candidate for membership of the Economic and Social Council and the Security Council. EVANGELOS VENIZELOS  Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece  associating with the European Union  called for Security Council reform as well as a legally binding climate change agreement.  The Climate Summit had been a chance to intensify in that regard.  On Ebola  he commended the United Nations establishment of an emergency mission.  Touching on other areas of interest to his country  he urged regional and international cooperation to resolve crises in the Middle East  North Africa and Eastern Europe.  The humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine also was worrying  he said  voicing support for the Minsk agreement as a precursor to an inclusive accord that respected Ukraine’s territorial integrity  independence and sovereignty.  He urged dialogue on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  and in Syria  underlined the importance of solution in light of the “barbaric actions” of jihadist groups there and along the Iraqi-Syrian border.  He welcomed the Security Council resolution on foreign terrorist fighters and called for protection of journalists. He said that Western Balkan States should integrate into the European Union  but first needed to implement reforms to meet the Union’s standards  and ensure good-neighbourly relations.  The Belgrade-Pristina talks were an example of such progress.  Among other things  he voiced support for the European and Euroatlantic perspective of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  noting that Greece was among the top foreign direct investors there.  Although he respected the United Nations directive on that country’s name  he said the critical issues concerned democracy  rule of law  human rights  inter-ethnic harmony and press freedom  all of which required “tangible steps”.  Turning to Cyprus  he expressed support for dialogue within the framework of the 2014 joint communiqué and confidence-building measures.  A just and viable solution had to align with Security Council resolutions  high-level agreements and the joint communiqué  and the Cypriot people should agree to any solution reached through a referendum.  He meanwhile supported maintaining the mandate of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). RI SU YONG  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  commended the successes of the Millennium Development Goals  notably the reduction of poverty by half over the first 15 years of the millennium.  His country had overcome severe hardships during that time  among them  an economic blockade  military threat and political obstruction  to safeguard its national dignity  deter war and put a stagnant economy back on track.  Citing national achievements in construction  the fishing industry and livestock farming  among others  he said that the post-2015 development agenda should focus on creating a favourable environment for attaining a common sustainable socioeconomic development for humankind  while consolidating successes of the Millennium Goals. He went on to say that the United Nations and international relations must be made more democratic and rest on respect for sovereignty and non–interference in the internal affairs of other nations.  The Security Council was still mired in the cold-war paralysis; its anachronistic stereotypes and prejudices could find their most extreme expression in the prevailing situation on the Korean peninsula.  Also evident was the unwillingness to take up the issue of “United States-South Korea” joint military exercises  aimed at taking over Pyongyang  a matter his country had officially referred to the Council.  Why were such exercises  with the participation of more than 500 000 troops  needed on the Korean peninsula nearly a quarter century after the end of the cold war  he asked.  The tense situation on the peninsula was a serious obstacle to his country’s economic development. In that context  he said the Security Council must stop “showcasing the extreme manifestation of the double standard”  noting  in particular  that the military exercises waged by a permanent member “is covered up with no regard to their serious threat to peace and security  whereas those conducted by a UN Member State in response is called into question”.  The Council should “no longer serve as a forum for telling lies”  he said  recalling the statement made 11 years ago in the Council by a permanent member that “there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq”.  That  he said  was “a big lie of the century”.  Council reform would revolutionize the Organization and render international relations more democratic.  His country’s decision to become a nuclear-weapon State was due to the “hostile policy  nuclear threat and stifling strategy” of the United States.  The nuclear issue would be resolved “if and when” the threat to his country’s sovereignty and right to life was removed.  National unification should be achieved not through “confrontation of systems”  but by two systems co-existing in one country. RAMTANE LAMAMRA  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria  said the Non-Aligned Movement had reaffirmed the right to development and the need to eradicate poverty  which were central to the post-2015 development agenda.  The agenda also should include responses to desertification and access to genetic resources.  Algeria coordinated the movement on revitalization of the General Assembly and would work with the African Union “C-10” group on Security Council reform  which was vital to redress historical injustices suffered by the African continent.  He also advocated strengthening of African Union-United Nations partnerships  particularly on conflict response.  He looked forward to the review of the question of Western Sahara  stressing support for the inalienable right of the people there to self-determination as well as for regional integration. He described President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s five-year plan  which hinged on factors including modernizing democracy  reform of the judiciary and strengthening of gender equality.  Investments would be made in sectors such as agriculture  energy  and the environment.  Algeria’s commitment to international partnerships meant rejection of unilateral measures like the embargo imposed on Cuba.  He urged international assistance for African countries hit by the Ebola epidemic  and noted Algeria’s cooperation on African peace and security matters.  The Algiers Process had helped to launch substantive negotiations between Mali’s Government and movements in the North  while a two-fold Algerian initiative in Libya aimed to foster dialogue  national reconciliation and institution-building.  He urged expanded efforts to thwart terrorism in the Sahel region   promising cooperation as co-chair of the working group on the Sahel.  There was a need for borders to be secured and abductions to be prevented  as demonstrated clearly by the crises in Iraq and Syria and the recent killing of a French citizen in Algeria.  Noting the outcome of the high-level Security Council meeting on terrorism and foreign combatants  he turned to the question of Palestine  calling for justice in finding a solution.  The Ninth Conference of Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was set to focus on the close relationship between disarmament  non-proliferation and the peaceful use of atomic energy.  He concluded by highlighting Algeria’s participation in the Human Rights Council and its national legislation to improve rights and equality. OLDEMIRO MARQUES BALÓI  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Mozambique  said it was important to accelerate the achievement of all the Millennium Development Goals and guarantee the sustainability of those that had been achieved.  The objective of the next development agenda should be the eradication of poverty  ensuring the promotion of equitable  sustainable and inclusive economic growth  with a focus on women and youth.  Greater commitment was needed from development partners to fund official development assistance and greater climate resilience and disaster prevention efforts in developing countries.  A transformative post-2015 development agenda should include strengthening financing mechanisms  concomitant with raising domestic financing. Further  the successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round was urgent.  A transformative development agenda should also reflect Africa’s priorities as expressed in its common position on the post-2015 development agenda.  That could only occur in the context of peace and stability.  Pointing out the grave instability and dramatic evolution of terrorism threats  he welcomed the Security Council’s call for an urgent boost in international cooperation to prevent the support and flow of terrorist fighters to and from conflict zones.  A collective strategy should strengthen multilateral approaches and address terrorism’s root causes.  Achievements in restoring peace and stability in a number of African nations pointed to the importance of coordination between the United Nations and the African Union. Stressing that the right to self-determination was central to human rights  he said the United Nations must help the peoples of Palestine and Western Sahara to realize those rights.  He then turned to Security Council reform  noting that the Organization’s inability to solve conflict situations and political instability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe posed a challenge to its authority as the multilateral political forum to foster dialogue.  On domestic matters  he spoke of his country’s strengthening democracy  steady economic growth and newly discovered natural resources  which could advance socioeconomic progress.  Developing new sources of clean and renewable energy was a priority for the Government. RUI MACHETE  Minister of State and Foreign Affairs of Portugal  asked the Assembly to support its candidacy for the Human Rights Council.  If elected for the 2015-2017 term  it would be the first time Portugal would serve as a member of that body.  Portugal had consistently upheld human rights and the second universal periodic review by the Council had acknowledged its strong human rights record.  Already  the country had submitted resolutions to the Human Rights Council on the right to education  as well as economic  social and cultural rights.  During its membership on the Security Council during the 2011-2012 period  Portugal had consistently promoted the human rights agenda. He highlighted the turmoil in Northern Africa during 2010 and 2011  which he said had had an unprecedented political  economic and social impact on countries in the region.  Those countries were now confronted with challenges related to the consolidation of political reforms  sustainable economic growth and security.  As a Co-Chair of the Western Mediterranean Forum  or ‘5+5’ initiative  Portugal wished to strengthen the contribution of this platform in enhancing cooperation amongst its 10 member states.  The situation in Libya — an important partner of the 5+5 forum — was deteriorating and the international community must give its assistance to the political transition process taking place in that country. As a significant political  business and investment partner to African States  Portugal also sought to contribute to international efforts aimed at stabilizing conflicts and mitigating security risks on the continent.  To that end  Portugal was participating in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and stood ready to engage in multinational efforts to strengthen the security of the Gulf of Guinea.  In particular  it would be willing to help enhance the maritime capabilities of countries in the region.  He praised the restoration of constitutional order in Guinea-Bissau  which despite socioeconomic difficulties and political instability was able to conduct free  fair and orderly elections.  The opportunity to “turn the page” on history must now be seized; Guinean-Bissau’s people were taking the right steps. LUBOMÍR ZAORÍÁLEK  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic  said that while a large part of Europe had been spared from violent conflicts for almost 70 years  a part of it today was still at war.  The territorial integrity of Ukraine had been violated by the Russian Federation’s annexation of Crimea and the activities of the Russian-backed paramilitary separatist forces in eastern Ukraine.  In the Middle East  the security situation in northern Iraq had continued to worsen  with brutal acts of violence being committed by the so-called Islamic State.  Concerning Syria  he said the only way to achieve a stable peace in that war-torn country was through a negotiated political settlement between the Syrian Government and the democratic opposition.  With respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  his Government had made an effort to provide humanitarian assistance to the victims. In view of those armed conflicts  he said the international community must share the responsibility of protecting people from atrocities.  However  if it failed to do so  it was necessary to establish accountability for serious violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law.  With respect to violence against women and girls  all States should adopt urgent measures to prevent such abhorrent incidents.  As a supporter of the “Rights Up Front” initiative launched by the Secretary-General and a member of the Human Rights Council  his country had presented for the second time a consensual resolution on political participation. Turning to the Assembly’s development agenda  he said the promotion of good governance  rule of law  human rights and the empowerment of women must remain as priorities.  Further  all countries — rich or poor — should be committed to creating a future that was economically viable and sustainable environmentally and socially.  In that regard  his country looked forward to being a member of the Economic and Social Council beginning in 2016. ARNOLD NICHOLSON  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Jamaica  welcomed the support of the international community in joining forces with small island developing States to negotiate the Samoa Pathway outcome document.  The ability of those countries to withstand economic and environmental shocks rested upon their ability to forge partnership with other members of the global family.  Within the context of the post-2015 development agenda  concerns related to the integration of those island States into the multilateral trading system  participation in the global financial system  and resilience to natural hazards had to be addressed. While the threats posed by climate change may be theoretical for some  it was very real for those who lived in the Caribbean  he said.  In recent years  countries in that region had to deal with an increased frequency of hurricanes  along with the burden of their substantial economic impact.  Ahead of the Conference of Parties in Peru  all Member States had to be engaged in devising an appropriate response to climate change.  Action was needed on the decision of the Conference to adopt a protocol  legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that would be applicable to all parties. He also reiterated Jamaica’s commitment to disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control.  Fuelled by the drug trade  the impact of the proliferation of small arms and lights weapons had been widely felt in his region.  It was encouraging  however  that with the fiftieth ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty earlier this week  that historic treaty would soon enter into force.  All States had a role to play in the maintenance of international peace and security.  For that reason  Jamaica was honoured to assume the Chairmanship of the First Committee of the General Assembly’s sixty-ninth session  reflecting its commitment to advancing disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control. ZARAR AHMAD OSMANI  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan  said that his country had achieved a significant milestone with the successful conclusion of the presidential election  including the recounting of votes.  He was confident that the new Government  with the full backing of a vast majority of Afghans  would strive to bring about political  security and socioeconomic prosperity to the country  the region and beyond. Speaking on extremism and terrorism  he said that despite some tangible results  that phenomenon remained a threat to the security  development and peace in his country and the region.  The Afghan forces were providing security independently across the country despite increasing acts of terrorism  which were supported by terrorists outside Afghanistan’s borders.  He added that his country strongly believed in good relations with neighbouring Pakistan  but  at the same time  was seriously concerned about the rocket attacks by Pakistani forces. On Millennium Development Goals  he commended the progress made in achieving most of the targets  particularly those related to health and universal primary education.  Afghanistan was committed to achieving most of the Goals by 2020 and considered the post-2015 agenda its top priority.  Moving to the Middle East  he expressed his Government’s full support for the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital  and for a political resolution in Syria  reached through a broad-based national dialogue that met the aspirations of all Syrians. Right of Reply Speaking in exercise of the right of reply  the representative of Iran responded to the issue of the Iranian islands raised by the United Arab Emirates  reiterating that his country maintained full sovereignty of the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs in the Persian Gulf.  Iran expressed its willingness to enter into discussions on that matter with the United Arab Emirates to clarify any misunderstanding that may have occurred on the issue. The representative of Pakistan  also speaking in exercise of the right of reply  responded to earlier remarks made by India’s Foreign Minister  who used the term “Pakistan-occupied Kashmir”.  He wished to clarify that the correct and historic name of that territory was instead “Jammu and Kashmir”.  Pakistan condemned terrorism and underscored diplomacy in resolving disputes. The representative of India rejected the remarks made by Pakistan and noted that they were willing to engage in dialogue “without the shadow of terror and fear”.  Raising issues in the forum would only derail future efforts of reaching a peaceful settlement. The representative of Pakistan  taking the floor again  noted that it was India  not Pakistan  that had blocked the dialogue on the issue at the Foreign Minister level.  Despite what India claimed  that issue had not been resolved in accordance to the Security Council resolution.  He stressed that terrorism was a common threat that “we must all work towards defeating”. The representative of India took the floor to reject in their entirety the comments made by Pakistan.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.  United Nations © 2014  New York  NY 10017 About us
2014-09-26,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11563.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. A geographically and sociopolitically diverse group of Heads of State sounded the alarm today about the unprecedented combination of challenges facing the troubled Middle East that was taking “terror to a new era and a new level”  as the General Assembly continued its high-level debate. The President of Iraq said the “ISIS” attacks on innocent civilians had established a “State” based on hatred.  The terrorist group  with its huge financial and military assets  had committed crimes against humanity  inflicted suffering on the Iraqi people and was attracting militants and extremists from around the world  including the United States and Europe  he said. A “terrorist onslaught” in Lebanon  said the country’s Council of Ministers President  was causing loss of military and civilian lives and considerable material damage.  The terrorists also obstructed the indirect negotiations conducted by his Government to calm the turbulent region.  The international mobilization against terrorist activities  however  reflected a global awareness of the urgent need to extinguish the “blazing flames” in the Middle East.  Events unfolding in Syria and Iraq  he continued  also had caused unprecedented waves of displaced persons  and destabilized nations  divided societies and destroyed human and material resources.  The Syrian war had driven 1.5 million displaced persons into Lebanon  which was equivalent to one third of its total population.  That unbearable burden could not be borne by any one country  he said. In that vein  the President of the State of Palestine  Mahmoud Abbas  noted that following the last war on Gaza — the third in five years — about half a million people had been displaced.  The number of destroyed homes  schools  hospitals  public buildings  mosques  factories and even cemeteries was incalculable and represented a series of war crimes.  The idea that it was possible to return to past patterns  which repeatedly failed  was naive  and in any case  wrong. Also examining the events crippling the Middle East was Malaysia’s Prime Minister  who said his Government had convened an international conference of scholars of Islamic law  where it had been agreed that for a State to be called “Islamic”  it must deliver economic  political and social justice  and it must advance the six objectives of Islamic law  namely  the right to life  religion  family  property  dignity and intellect.  “ISIL”  he said  had violated every single one of those.  It was therefore neither Islamic  nor a State. The Prime Minister of Luxembourg echoed that point  saying that ISIL tarnished Islam and sought only to spread its terror to destabilize Syria  Iraq and beyond.  He reiterated support for measures aimed at cutting off financing  preventing radicalization and stemming the flow of foreign fighters  and he urged the world community to tackle the root causes of the grave crisis in Iraq.  The world was witnessing a “globalization of hatred”  proclaimed Malta’s Prime Minister.  He urged a resumption of meaningful negotiations in the Middle East  as “too many innocent civilians have died; too many children have been buried”  and he called on the Security Council to act urgently and decisively to end the bloodshed in Syria.  Closer to home  he stressed more attention was needed to the plight of illegal immigrants in the Mediterranean.  Both Malta and Italy were doing their utmost to save lives  he said  but the States receiving waves of migrants could not stand up to the challenge alone.  Adding to the day’s multifaceted debate was a Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina  who  noting the many events dedicated to the anniversary of the Sarajevo assassination  said Bosnians asked themselves whether they had learned the lessons from the past.  Regrettably  he said  given the local wars fought on all sides of the world today  it seemed the international community had not learned those lessons  but rather had repeated old mistakes and made new ones. Serbia's President was one of several speakers referring to the benefits of European Union integration  noting that pursuit of membership was his country's top foreign policy priority.  The Prime Minister of Georgia also discussed efforts to establish European political  economic  social and legislative norms and standards  as part of an integration strategy. Also speaking in the debate were Heads of State and Government of Namibia  Guyana  Cyprus  Lithuania  Côte d’Ivoire  Slovenia  Guinea  El Salvador  Congo  Samoa  Pakistan  Somalia  Haiti  Federated States of Micronesia  Dominica  the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  Comoros  Marshall Islands  Kiribati  Nepal  Belgium  and Trinidad and Tobago. Speaking at the ministerial level were representatives of Azerbaijan  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  Sudan  Guatemala  and Zambia. Speaking in exercise of the right of reply were representatives of India  Armenia  and Azerbaijan. The Assembly will meet again at 9 a.m. tomorrow  27 September  to continue its debate. Statements HIFIKEPUNYE POHAMBA  President of Namibia  pointed to numerous crises confronting the international community  including several African countries facing an outbreak of Ebola; the 200 girls abducted in Nigeria; and Gaza having received “indiscriminate” bombardment  which had ended only 45 days ago.  Terrorist groups were disrupting peace and stability in different parts of the world.  But these challenges were not insurmountable.  The enduring values and principles of the United Nations Charter should guide the international community  as should the theme of the sixty-ninth session  “Delivering on and Implementing a Transformative Post-2015 Development Agenda”. Reflecting on the Millennium Development Goals  their targets and implementation  he said that in his country  the percentage of people living in extreme poverty had been more than halved.  Communities that had previously been cut off from health care had now been reached  including those affected by HIV/AIDS; infection rates had stabilized and increasing numbers of affected people were receiving antiretroviral medication.  Namibia was moving closer to eliminating malaria as a public health threat  and access to clean drinking water and sanitation had also expanded.  In meeting the basic needs of human beings while protecting the natural environment on which people depended  the root causes of poverty and political conflicts in countries should be addressed holistically. His Government had called for the implementation of the Plan of Action on climate change  and the Namibia Declaration  which had been adopted in Windhoek at the 2013 Conference of Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification  he said.  Commending the Secretary-General for hosting the Climate Change Summit  he said that its outcome should complement the negotiations within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) with the ultimate aim of reaching a coordinated global agreement in 2015. He also voiced concern about the “political instability” and armed conflict in South Sudan  Mali  and the Central African Republic.  On the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  a range of measures needed to be implemented in order to consolidate peace.  Namibia supported women’s participation in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations around the world  and had deployed one of the largest female police contingents to the African Union — the United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID).  The embargo on Cuba should be lifted  and the country should not be listed as a State sponsor of international terrorism.  All relevant United Nations resolutions on Western Sahara and Palestine should be fully implemented. DONALD RABINDRANAUTH RAMOTAR  President of Guyana  said that despite the negative impact of the international financial situation  his country had grown its economy over the past eight years and ensured that it had resulted in an improved quality of life for its people.  They were one of only 17 countries in the world which had  according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)  not only reduced hunger by half  but also improved the nutrition of its people.  It had achieved universal primary education  and was close to achieving universal secondary education.  He expressed gratitude to all development partners who had contributed to the progress made towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The world could have had advanced much further along the road to achieving the Millennium Development Goals  he said.  However  the partnership needed to achieve all the objectives had not been strong enough.  Support from developed countries  as envisaged by Millennium Development Goal 8  had fallen short of expectations.  Only about a dozen developed countries had kept their pledge to provide 0.7 per cent of their gross national product (GDP) to official development assistance (ODA).  In light of these failures  it was imperative that the post-2015 framework include a time-bound commitment for delivery of ODA to which commitments had already been made. On the Middle East  he called for an end to the “apartheid-like” situation in Palestine  where poverty and degradation were weapons used to repress its people.  They had a right to live with dignity in their own country  and the United Nations must never compromise on the principle of self-determination.  Speaking on the continuing wars in Syria and Iraq  he condemned the “barbaric and grotesque” killings of journalists  humanitarian aid workers and other hostages  and the loss of lives of civilians by the murderous extremists. He called the Ebola epidemic a global problem that required an immediate response of a scale far beyond what was currently being done.  Today’s problems could only be properly addressed with strong multilateralism and through relevant  responsive and more democratic global institutions.  Critical among those were the reforms of the Security Council and international financial institutions.  He concluded by recalling Guyana’s proposal to balance the interests of developed and developing countries.  Its time had come and should be pursued with other initiatives to find solutions  he added. NICOS ANASTASIADES  President of Cyprus  recalled that  in last year’s General Assembly debate  he had expressed his concern about terrorism  annexation of territories via illegal use of force  religious fundamentalism and forcible displacement of millions of peoples.  Unfortunately  and despite international efforts  the global community had not adequately risen to meet those challenges.  What had been witnessed in Libya  Lebanon  Syria and Iraq  particularly following the emergence of ISIL  should not leave delegates indifferent or passive. Cyprus  which was located at the crossroads of Europe  North Africa and the Near and Middle East  was proud to be a European Union member State and enjoyed excellent neighbourly relations  which was why his country was “considered an honest broker with no hidden agenda”.  The discovery of hydrocarbons nearby had upgraded Cyprus’s strategic importance.  His country stood ready to mediate in bringing neighbouring hydrocarbon-producing and –consuming countries together  as energy could serve as a catalyst for broader cooperation and contribute to peace and stability. Noting the fortieth anniversary of the violent division of Cyprus  he emphasized that it had been a consequence of the 1974 invasion and its continued occupation by Turkey.  He called for a settlement that would reunite Cyprus and its peoples  restore the fundamental freedoms and human rights of its lawful citizens and relieve the island from the presence of occupying troops.  That was based on an agreed upon compromise that Cyprus would evolve into a bicommunal  bizonal federation with political equality  a single sovereignty  a single international legal personality and a single citizenship. Drawing attention to the 11 February Joint Declaration agreed upon by the two communities this year  he urged Turkey to constructively contribute to efforts to reach a settlement. “My ultimate vision is to relieve all Cypriots  especially younger generations  the future of the country  from the anachronistic burden of having to live in a divided country in which they are forcibly prevented from enjoying the freedoms that is the birthright of every citizen in the world ” he said. DALIA GRYBAUSKAITĖ  President of Lithuania  said the nature of global security had changed dramatically  with non-State actors  religious fundamentalists and rebellious criminal gangs terrorizing the world and threatening the safety of peaceful people.  Sadly  some States were supporting terrorists and had become hubs and shelters for growing violence. Peaceful and sustainable coexistence between countries and societies required collective efforts  determination and national commitment  she said.  As a group of nations  the international community must maintain undivided security and exert all its efforts to stop ISIS and Al-Qaida  and restore peace and security in the Middle East.  The same efforts should be directed to address the geopolitical challenges in Eastern Europe  and it was the international community’s duty to support peace  sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Most importantly  she said  the international community must never abandon the values that held it together:  respect for human rights and the fundamental principles of State sovereignty and territorial unity.  Its ongoing commitment to protecting these core values was evident in voting results  at the United Nations  concerning the armed conflict in Ukraine  when 100 States had supported the Nation and condemned the Russian Federation’s occupation of Crimea.  A silent consent to such aggression should not be the response of the international community. ALASSANE OUATTARA  President of Côte d’Ivoire  said that on a national level  implementation of the Millennium Development Goals was continuing within a national development programme.  Before the end of 2015  his country would take steps to further reduce poverty  improve maternal and infant health  consolidate progress on combating HIV/AIDS and expand access to primary education and drinking water.  The Millennium Development Goals had been a vehicle for his Government’s ambition  and at a time when the world we wished to see was emerging  there was a desire to give the most vulnerable people a decent life  give our planet reprieve and extend the opportunity to exist for centuries to come. On the theme of the general debate  he noted that the priorities of developing countries should be paid particular attention  and that intergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda must be inclusive and balanced.  Africa had become one of the most attractive regions of the world for international investment  providing unique opportunities in fields including infrastructure and energy  among others.  However  with the challenges which faced our world today  such as the spread of terrorism  piracy and Ebola  Africa now risked losing a decade of human progress and economic growth. Africa could not become “the forgotten continent” in the struggle against terror  he said.  Thanking bilateral and multilateral partners that had assisted his Government  he conveyed special thanks to the people of the United States for “bold and outstanding” measures taken to assist West Africa in conquering Ebola.  On the issue of climate change  he noted that final efforts were needed to achieve an agreement in 2015.  Today his country was a nation at peace and work.  Côte d’Ivoire had regained the confidence of its partners  and thanks to the cohesion of its citizens  economic growth was strong. BORUT PAHOR  President of Slovenia  said that  due to new circumstances  the existing structure of the United Nations  and the Security Council above all  was failing its fundamental purpose.  If the Organization was not reformed so that it could successfully cope with international conflicts  it risked being side-lined.  More and more often  deadlock in the Security Council was used as an excuse for resolving conflicts with force and without United Nations mandate.  Those deficiencies had to be remedied immediately  thoroughly and by consensus  or it might be too late.  “The third  and probably the last world war  could in many respects be the result of an obsolete and ineffective United Nations Organization”  he added. He said international security architecture must be reconsidered in order to improve capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts  and reclaim the shared values and principles enshrined in the Charter.  Complementary to the United Nations  regional and subregional organizations  within their mandates and areas of expertise  must play a key role in maintaining peace and stability.  Although there were specific circumstances that could compel the international community to maintain peace by the use of force  a United Nations mandate was essential to ensure credibility.  If intervening without it became the norm  the world would certainly arrive at a point where arbitrary action could trigger conflict of broad and uncontrollable dimensions. Next year’s twentieth anniversary of the genocide in Srebrenica should serve as a sober reminder of the responsibility to protect civilians in countries like Iraq  Syria  South Sudan and the Central African Republic  he said.  Slovenia supported the French initiative on voluntary restraint from the use of veto in situations of war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.  A comprehensive United Nations approach was also needed for the global threat of terrorism  extremism and militant radicalism that was emerging in the broader Middle East and North Africa.  Necessary reforms and renewed commitment to the United Nations principles were needed  as that was the only way to maintain global order based on international law. ALPHA CONDÉ  President of Guinea  said that unless measures were taken to cope with challenges  the glimmers of hope around the world would be threatened  as would be the peace  security  and stability of our planet.  Only a global  concerted approach would lead to progress.  On that note  the Ebola crisis was continuing to claim lives  and on a national level  his Government had declared a health emergency to cope with the outbreak.  The negative impact of the disease was not confined to the health sector; Ebola had led to a slowdown in trade  a drop in productivity  a decline in tourism  and stigmatizing effects.  The irrational panic  which had taken over the world needed to be combatted. Ebola was a serious epidemic  but it was not necessarily a death sentence.  Guinea welcomed the nomination of a United Nations system coordinator in the ongoing struggle against Ebola  and thanked the World Health Organization (WHO)  Médecins sans Frontières  the Red Cross and political figures for their support.  There was an urgent need to move forward in fighting the disease.  On development challenges  the international community had to put an end to poverty which was continuing to hold nearly 2 billion people hostage.  That was a question of dignity  justice and equality.  While progress had been achieved on the Millennium Development Goals  the digital divide remained  and progress was needed on tackling malaria and HIV/AIDS-related issues. The plethora of challenges required a comprehensive response.  For its part  Guinea was taking part in a dynamic process  having undertaken reform of the defence and security industry since 2010  and made improvements to the independence of the judiciary.  The country’s “thirst” to ensure the well-being of its population could only be quenched in an environment of stability.  Making its contribution to a reformed United Nations  Africa would have to shoulder its responsibilities.  It was time  he said  to be “genuine builders of our destiny”  and consolidate credibility in stabilizing the continent.  In conclusion  he noted Guinea’s solidarity with the Palestinian people. SALVADOR SANCHEZ CERÉN  President of El Salvador  said that  in recent years  his country had achieved significant improvements in human development.  Extreme poverty had been reduced to 13.6 per cent in rural areas  and the Government had allocated 14.8 per cent of GDP to social spending.  Primary education coverage had increased to 93.7 per cent  reducing illiteracy by a little more than 5 per cent.  Additionally  maternal mortality had been significantly reduced  and improved sanitation and access to drinking water had been implemented. On the new development agenda  he said it was critical to face the great threat of climate change  which triggered disasters and impacted people’s lives.  It was also urgent to amend existing financial architecture and international cooperation instruments so that they could respond to people’s needs efficiently and transparently.  The terms under which development assistance were granted should be renewed.  In that regard  he called upon the United Nations to maintain its resources and programs in Latin America  and specifically in Central America  regardless of the macroeconomic classification of the countries therein  stressing that a reduction in the Organization’s presence would only worsen economic and social problems in the region. He went on to say that El Salvador had been raising awareness about the risks of irregular migration  especially to the United States.  However  the international community must help overcome the crisis generated by the increased flow of unaccompanied migrant children traveling to the United States  emphasizing that the Assembly must assume a more prominent role on the issue of migration  including it in the post-2015 development agenda.  The threat to public safety was another major challenge faced by his country  as it was for many others in the region.  He urged the international community to strengthen its support for El Salvador and Central America’s struggle against violence in all its forms. He voiced deep regret about the loss of lives  particularly children  as a result of indiscriminate attacks in Gaza  and expressed concern about recent aggression from the self-proclaimed Islamic State against a defenceless civilian population.  As a proponent of human rights  his country had presented its candidacy to the Human Rights Council  which would hold elections during the current session of the Assembly. DENIS SASSOU NGUESSO  President of Congo  said the world was in turbulence  with humankind facing numerous tensions and conflicts  terrorism  old and new epidemics  persisting disparities and climate change.  All that made people place their faith in the United Nations  the only instrument the world had to search for solutions to numerous problems.  He called on the States to prioritize action directed towards peace  security and the preservation of nature.  The world needed peace and security in places such as Syria  Ukraine  Iraq  between Israelis and Palestinians  as well as in Africa  especially in Libya  the Sahel-Saharan region  South Sudan  Central Africa and the Great Lakes region. Africa needed increased support from the international community  he said.  That assistance was needed so that Somalia could escape the abyss  Mali could recover its unity  and the Democratic Republic of the Congo would not plunge again into violence.  The continent also required help to halt maritime piracy  developing dangerously in the Gulf of Guinea  and reduce the spread of terrorism from the Sahel to the south of Africa.  In Central Africa  insecurity was often not only the result of wars and armed violence  but of poverty and diseases such as malaria  HIV/AIDS and Ebola.  He was pleased by the solidarity shown by the international community in helping those African countries affected by the Ebola outbreak. On climate change  he said that it was a major threat to the planet.  It was important for his country and Africa to establish mechanisms for transferring innovative technologies and finances  to ensure a real implementation of the Green Fund  to have a proactive climate change programme and to optimize existing opportunities in the fight against climate change.  The illegal exploitation and illicit trade of flora and fauna represented another threat to the biodiversity and environment  he added. On the Millennium Development Goals  he said that the analysis by stakeholders at all levels had shown that they had not attained the objectives  inter alia  because of shortcomings in their initial preparation and formulation.  His continent would have the largest number of countries not attaining the Goals by 2015.  To meet those challenges  African leaders had adopted a joint position on the post-2015 development agenda.  He concluded by re-affirming his country’s commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights by strengthening its legal and institutional framework with the full participation of civil society. MAHMOUD ABBAS  President of the State of Palestine  said that 2014 marked the International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People  but Israel had chosen to make it “a year of a new war of genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian people”.  While the Assembly conveyed the world’s yearning and determination to realize a just peace that achieved freedom and independence for his people in their State of Palestine alongside Israel  the occupying Power had chosen to defy the world by launching a war on Gaza.  He recalled that he had urged the world in 2012 to prevent a new Nakba by supporting the establishment of a free and independent State of Palestine.  “Here we are again today ” he said. This war on Gaza was the third in five years  he said  noting that the difference today was the scale of genocidal crime was larger  and the list of martyrs  especially children  was longer.  Another difference was that about half a million people had been displaced  and the number of homes  schools  hospitals  public buildings  mosques  factories and even cemeteries destroyed was unprecedented.  It represented a series of war crimes.  It was inconceivable that anyone could claim that they did not realize the magnitude and horror of those crimes.  “We will not forgive  and we will not allow war criminals to escape punishment ” he declared  stressing his people’s legitimate right to defend themselves against the Israeli war machine and to resist the colonial  racist occupation. Citing negotiations under the auspices of the United States  and in particular  the efforts of President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry  he said that his Administration exercised “unimaginable self-restraint  silencing our cries and tending to our own wounds in order to give American efforts the best possible chance for success”.  Where do we go from here  he asked.  The idea that it was possible to return to past patterns of work  which repeatedly failed  was naive  and in any case  wrong.  That ignored the fact that it was no longer acceptable nor possible to repeat methods that had proved futile  or to continue with approaches that had repeatedly failed and required comprehensive review and radical correction. At the invitation of Egypt and Norway  an international conference for the relief and reconstruction of the Gaza Strip would soon take place  he said.  His Government would present comprehensive reports to the gathering.  Over the past two weeks  Palestine and the Arab Group undertook intensive contacts with various regional groups in the United Nations to prepare for the introduction of a draft resolution to be adopted by the Security Council on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  pushing forward efforts to achieve peace.  That endeavour aspired to correct the deficiency of previous efforts to achieve peace by affirming the goal of ending the Israeli occupation and achieving a two-State solution  of the State of Palestine  with East Jerusalem as its capital  over the entire territory occupied in 1967  alongside the State of Israel. NEBOJŠA RADMANOVIĆ  Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina  said the world was in a state of chaos.  From Afghanistan through Ukraine  the Middle East  Libya  Central Africa and other regions  there were armed conflicts without lasting peace in sight.  The rise of internal civil conflict was causing States to fall apart  with some disappearing overnight  and others springing up with the support of outside mentors.  New political maps were being drawn with new borders  separatist movements were getting stronger and international laws were being violated with use of force.  That situation  he said  was a result of the unilateral actions of some great Powers  double standards in international relations  and other actions contrary to the norms of international law. Bosnia and Herzegovina  although characterized by an open and fully liberal economy  was facing large-scale unemployment  a large trade deficit  lack of capital and major investment  and insufficient and weak industrial production  he said.  Its economic reconstruction and recovery had slowed down due to the global economic crisis that had engulfed the world.  He called upon the developed world to help his country’s efforts in sustainable development  noting that Bosnia and Herzegovina was too small a country to achieve that alone.  He expressed hope that small countries who shared that view would find more partners among the developed countries with which to focus on development and recovery.  Tomorrow’s world should not be put in the position of a “false choice” between who should and should not be saved  he said  stressing that  “either we all survive or nobody does.” This year  his country marked the Sarajevo assassination  commonly viewed as the immediate cause of the First World War  he said.  At several events dedicated to that anniversary  the people of his country had asked themselves whether they had learned the lessons of the past.  Given the local wars fought on all sides of the world today  it seemed the international community had not learned those lessons  but rather had repeated old mistakes and made new ones.  Now more than ever  the world needed peace; it was only through peace that people could develop and prosper.  It was Member States’ responsibility to improve security in the world in the interest of development and progress. TUILAEPA SAILELE MALIELEGAOI  Prime Minister of Samoa  said that climate change was an urgent crisis  which dwarfed all others.  Its victims could be rich or poor countries  big or small  he said  rejecting the view that its implications were looming in only certain State.  He rebuffed complacency by any country  saying all must work together as “a single constituency”.  Time was slipping away  and the international community would be soon playing catch-up.  Upcoming Lima and Paris conferences on climate change offered the best opportunity for the world to save itself.  The recent summit had been timely and its message clear: without action  the situation would worsen.  Climate change was a societal problem  which required political will and a societal response.  Also vital was to find a global solution  and the United Nations represented the best hope for doing so  he said  stressing the importance of reaching a post-Kyoto agreement. Turning to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa  he said the crisis respected no national borders  indiscriminately claiming victims.  Samoa was among the 134 co-sponsors of a Security Council resolution on the spread of the virus.  Council action had been followed by a General Assembly resolution to establish a United Nations Mission for Emergency Ebola Response.  That was a powerful demonstration of what could be achieved when nations united.  That spirit of cooperation should prevail when dealing with other critical issues.  On extremism  he said that phenomenon seemed so far removed from Pacific island States  but due to global interconnectedness  those States could be exposed to risks as well. The United Nations had been founded on collective security  he said  describing that principle as important to small islands  whose development gains could be erased by security events.  Small island developing States needed the United Nations special attention owing to their inherent challenges  which were outside their control.  Three weeks ago  his nation had hosted the third international conference on small island developing States (SIDS)  successfully casting a global spotlight on their issues  which should not be forgotten with the passage of time or overshadowed by other competing issues.  The follow-up to the meeting’s outcome was on the General Assembly’s agenda for this session.  The outcome text  known as the Samoa Pathway  asked the Secretary-General to undertake a comprehensive review of how the United Nations could best support small island developing States.  “We may be small and invisible  but a united SIDS is strong ” he declared  underscoring that implementation of the Samoa Pathway must be solidly entrenched in the post-2015 development agenda. MOHAMMED FUAD MASUM  President of Iraq  calling ISIS a real danger  said that group's attacks on innocent civilians had taken terror to a new era and level  establishing a State based on hatred.  With its huge financial and military assets  it had committed crimes against humanity  inflicted suffering on Iraqi people and had become a hotbed  attracting militants and extremists from around the world  including America and Europe.  His Government had successfully liberated some cities that had been occupied by the terrorist organization  owing to the huge humanitarian and military support received from the United Nations  United States  the European Union and other friendly States and for which he was grateful.  Such support confirmed that his country was not fighting terror alone. Drawing attention to millions of defenceless civilians who had been forced to live under the tyranny of ISIS  he called upon the international community to provide protection  relief and support for his country's efforts.  The Iraqi people were determined to cleanse their land of the armed group  he said  stressing that eliminating terror in their country would be an important step in ridding the world of danger.  He called for the institutionalization of “that responsible position” against terrorism and for such an institution to be tasked with developing and operationalizing solidarity to fight terrorism. Pained to see the suffering of their fraternal Palestinian people in Gaza and other Palestinian territories  he also called upon the international community to honour its commitment to the Palestinian people and exert efforts to restore peace.  As well  he said he wished those in Yemen and Libya success on their path to democracy and voiced hope that the Syrian people would be able to overcome this crisis  unite to end bloodshed and preserve life and democracy.  Continued tension would always support extremism and tyrannical ideology.  As such  the international community could not allow an exacerbation of that conflict. Turning to the results of the Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  he said the question of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations did not occupy the space it deserved in the report.  It could have addressed the challenge as its own objective  looking to its causes and ways to address it.  Recalling that people around the world were still promoting partnership and enhancing prospects for peace and security  he said there was no other option but to defeat ISIS everywhere  as well as other elements that continued to threaten the international community. XAVIER BETTEL  Prime Minister of Luxembourg  said that “commitment  solidarity and responsibility” would continue to guide his country's action at the United Nations  which was at the heart of multilateralism.  As for a transformative post-2015 development agenda  he highlighted the session’s theme and said the new framework must be bold and ambitious if it was to live up to its collective responsibility to eradicate poverty and promote sustainable development.  It must also build on the Millennium Development Goals and go further.  The agenda  he continued  must be holistic  action-oriented  universally applicable  benefitting both developing and developed countries  and human-rights-based.  Emphasis on the social sectors  including health and education  must include issues of governance  justice  peace  security  environmental protection  sustainable consumption and production patterns  as well as sustained economic growth. Since 2000  he said  Luxembourg had belonged to the group of five industrialized countries  which devoted at least 0.7 per cent of gross national income (GNI) to development cooperation.  In 2009  Luxembourg’s development assistance had reached 1 per cent and the Government was committed to maintaining that high level. The Climate Summit  he said  had fulfilled the dual objectives set by the Secretary-General: to harness the indispensable political will to reach a global agreement in 2015 and catalyse concrete action on the ground to reduce emissions and increase resilience.  During the second half of 2015  his country would assume the presidency of the European Union Council  and in that role  would spare no effort to find  at the Paris Climate Conference  an international agreement on climate  with the objective of keeping the increase of global temperature below 2°C.  With European partners  his country had made binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  and at the recent Summit  had supported carbon pricing.  It had also announced a new contribution of 5 million euros to the Green Climate Fund. Turning to his country's role in the Security Council  he said that Luxembourg  together with Australia and Jordan  had tabled two resolutions on humanitarian aid access to Syria  which had been adopted unanimously.  Yet  humanitarian action was no substitute for political action.  On extremism  he said that ISIL was neither a State nor Islamic.  It tarnished Islam and sought only to spread its terror regime to destabilize Syria  Iraq and beyond.  Luxembourg fully supported measures to counter individuals and entities associated with Al-Qaida  such as those aimed at cutting off financing  preventing radicalization and stemming the flow of foreign terrorist fighters.  Beyond the fight against terrorism  the global community must tackle the root causes of the grave crisis in Iraq.  In that context  he welcomed the formation of a new Iraqi government of national unity. MUHAMMAD NAWAZ SHARIF  Prime Minister of Pakistan  said that extreme weather was disrupting world economies  particularly in developing countries.  Recent monsoon floods in his country had killed hundreds of people  displaced millions  and destroyed and damaged homes  livelihoods  infrastructure  cattle and crops.  The Government was mobilizing all its resources and ingenuity to provide relief and ensure recovery.  He called on the international community to intensify its efforts to move from awareness to commitments on actions addressing climate change. Pakistan had launched its “Vision 2025”  which put people first  he said.  In the coming decade  it would develop human and social capital through investment in education  health and gender parity; stimulate sustained economic growth; prioritize energy  water and food security; modernize the public sector; and encourage sector-led entrepreneurship.  His Government would also pursue a policy of constructive engagement and remain engaged in the dialogue process needed to settle disputes and build economic and trade relations. More than six decades ago the United Nations had passed resolutions to hold a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir  he said.  However  the people there were still waiting for the fulfilment of that promise.  Many generations of Kashmiris had lived under occupation  accompanied by violence and abuse of their fundamental rights.  It was the responsibility of the international community to resolve the issue of Jammu and Kashmir  he underscored  reaffirming Pakistan’s readiness to work for a resolution of this problem through negotiations. Afghanistan was going through momentous security  political and economic transitions  he continued  voicing hope that these landmark processes would result in a stronger  more stable and unified country.  Condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations  he called on the United Nations to facilitate a just and lasting solution of the Palestinian issue. As a responsible nuclear weapon State  he said  Pakistan would continue to support the objectives of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation  and pursue a policy of nuclear restraint and credible minimum deterrence.  To promote stability  it was prepared to explore new confidence-building measures  he added.  He also said that  in regard to the reform of the Security Council  there should be no new permanent seats on it; instead  the body should become more representative  equitable  accountable and transparent. JOSEPH MUSCAT  Prime Minister of Malta  highlighted the need for the resumption of meaningful negotiations in the Middle East.  “Too many innocent civilians have died; too many children have been buried ” he said.  Statesmanship was needed from the politicians on both sides to resolve the conflict.  Negotiators must be willing to make the right choices  not the most convenient ones.  They might not be the most popular  but they would be the most enduring.  Concerning Syria  he urged the Security Council to assume its Charter-based responsibilities and act urgently and decisively to end the bloodshed.  Regarding Libya  the United Nations must provide capacity-building and security to bring stability and prosperity to the Libyan people.  Disarmament and national reconciliation were prerequisite to the country’s advancement  he added. Moving on to the spread of extremism and intolerance  he said the world was witnessing the “globalization of hatred”.  Extremists were increasingly interconnected through networks and inventions whose main aim should be progress and education.  Disenchanted youth were radicalized into movements that knew no limits.  He stressed that nobody was immune to what was undoubtedly the biggest threat to world stability and peace. He also called for more attention to the plight of illegal immigrants in the Mediterranean.  Both Malta and Italy were doing their utmost to save lives  but the States receiving waves of migrants could not stand up to the challenge alone.  He therefore urged the international community to help them stop the great human tragedies that came with the risky crossing of the Mediterranean.  Closer cooperation between countries of origin  transit and destination was needed  as were better enforcement mechanisms and stronger penalties to stop and punish human traffickers.  Better implementation of internationally agreed upon commitments was also crucial  he added. TAMMAM SALAM  President of the Council of Ministers of Lebanon  voiced concern at the “terrorist onslaught” his country was facing from “obscurantist and criminal groups”  which had attacked various Lebanese regions causing loss of military and civilian lives and considerable material damage.  Those crimes had obstructed ongoing indirect negotiations conducted by his Government in the turbulent region.  The present international mobilization against terrorist activities reflected a global awareness of the urgent need to extinguish “blazing flames” in the region.  Noting that Lebanon’s fight against terrorism was not new  he said he looked forward to unveiling the truth  ending impunity  and ensuring justice was served through the work of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. The events unfolding in Syria and Iraq represented human crimes that could not be understood or accepted by any mind or religion  he continued.  Committed in the name of Islam  they had cost the lives of tens of thousands of Muslim civilians and had caused unprecedented waves of displaced persons  while destabilizing nations  dividing societies and destroying human and material resources.  Noting the attacks against Christians and Yazidis in Iraq  he said that any offensive against religions or their followers and sacred places was an offensive against human dignity.  His country had the only Christian president in the Middle East and despite political crises  Lebanon remained a model of diversity in the region. The Syrian war had displaced 1.5 million Syrians into Lebanon  equivalent to one third of its total population  he said.  That had been placing an unbearable burden on economic  humanitarian  social  education  health and security systems.  Due to the regional situation  national economic growth had dropped to zero  causing the country a loss of $7.5 billion.  It was a national disaster.  The burden of Syrian refugees could not be borne by any one country  but must be shared.  Expressing concern for the unity  sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Syria  he reaffirmed his Government’s policy of “self-distancing” to protect Lebanon against the repercussions of neighbouring crises. He continued to appeal to the international community to compel Israel to fulfil its obligations under Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  to stop violating Lebanese sovereignty by land  sea and air  cooperate fully with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and withdraw from the area north to Ghajar  the Shebaa Farms and Kfarshouba Hills.  Further  he reaffirmed Lebanon’s rights to territorial waters  and to the natural oil and gas within its exclusive economic zone.  He also called for legal accountability for war crimes committed by Israel  including in Gaza  underscoring that Israel was responsible for foiling all efforts to reach a peaceful settlement based on a two-State solution. The Levant today provided an ugly platform where the latest form of human savagery was on display  he said.  The region  however  was made up of ordinary people with land  homes  tales  dreams and history  eager to live as free and equal citizens in free and stable countries.  “The world must stop counting our dead  and must rise to its obligation and seek to establish peace in this tormented part of the world ” he stated.  That peace must be based on right and justice  while respecting the sovereignty of nations  upholding their security and safeguarding the fundamental rights of individuals and groups. DATO’ SRI MOHD NAJIB BIN TUN HAJI ABDUL RAZAK  Prime Minister of Malaysia  said his country had contributed more than 20 million rubber gloves to help doctors and nurses who were working to stop the Ebola outbreak.  On other matters of interest to his country  he said the MH370 and MH17 tragedies would be remembered forever; his Government would not give up the search for MH370 and would continue to seek justice for those who had died in the downing of MH17.  He recalled that  four years ago  in the General Assembly  he had called for a global movement of moderates to counter extremism.  “The threat to world peace and security is not Islam  but extremism ” he said.  The question had been how to respond to it.  In the past  the international community had launched wars against it without planning for peace.  It had attacked one evil only to see a greater evil emerge.  “This time must be different ” he said  stressing the need to defeat not just extremists  but also their ideas.  True Islam must be promoted. Malaysia  he said  had marginalized extremism  maintaining a multi-religious country  where different faiths coexisted and prospered  and showed that Islam could not only succeed  but drive progress and development in a pluralistic society.  In Malaysia  there were streets in which mosques  temples and churches stood side by side.  This moderate approach could make a valuable contribution to fragile States and international affairs alike.  It was a philosophy Malaysia used when acting as an honest broker in peace processes in the southern Philippines and elsewhere.  Malaysia would pursue that approach as it chaired the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) next year and moved it forward at the United Nations in the coming weeks.  That work informed its bid for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the coming term. The fight against extremism was not about Christians versus Muslims  or Muslims versus Jews  but moderates versus extremists of all religions  he continued  emphasizing the need to rally a coalition of moderates.  The fight against extremists must be won  not just in Syria and Iraq  but in the United Kingdom  Belgium  the United States and Malaysia.  His country had managed to prevent extremism from gaining a foothold  but a few Malaysians had been lured by foreign terrorist fighters into Iraq and Syria.  Countries must educate  include and confront those at risk of radicalization.  They must also confront the myth that committing atrocities in the name of an Islamic State was an act of faith and that death in the service of that aim brought martyrdom. Extremists used that distorted narrative as a recruitment tool  he pointed out.  An international conference of scholars of Islamic law  convened by his Government  had agreed that for a State to be called “Islamic” it must deliver economic  political and social justice  and must protect and advance the six objectives of Islamic law: the right to life  religion  family  property  dignity and intellect.  ISIL had violated every single one of those.  It was neither Islamic  nor a State  he concluded  stressing that Islam was a religion of peace  one that valued coexistence  mutual comprehension and learning.   HASSAN SHEIKH MOHAMUD  President of Somalia  said his country was no longer a country of war  piracy  extremism  famine  droughts and floods.  It would no longer be known through films like Captain Philips or Black Hawk Down.  Focusing on such descriptions meant missing “the beauty of a very different picture that we are painting right now in Somalia”  he said  adding that his country “may still be fragile  but we are no longer broken”. A new Government had been established in September 2012  he said  pointing to the national consensus that underpinned it and the unanimous recognition it enjoyed in the international community.  The Government faced many complex challenges  including a lack of resources and only very basic institutional and Government structures.  The country was divided  without a clear path to unification  and Al-Shabaab controlled a lot of territory.  Meanwhile  there were high expectations about security  political inclusivity  health  education  private sector development and basic economic reform.  Nonetheless  the future’s foundation was being laid through the clear military defeat of Al-Shabaab by the joint efforts of the Somali National Army and the African Union mission.  More than 70 per cent of south and central Somalia was now under Government control. The Government’s focus was on “building a foundation and laying down the groundwork for stabilization and ensuing reform”  he said  describing progress in legal  political  financial  economic and social fields.  Somalia had cemented its place in the international community  strengthening relations with its neighbours and establishing forums for dialogue.  Key financial institutions were being established to provide accountability and control  and he was heartened by the progress “from failed State to a nascent  functioning State”.  It was vital to stay the course  however  and Somalia was at a critical point in achieving stability and security.  Terrorism was rising around the world  but Somalia had significantly advanced its fight against the scourge.  Military solutions were not enough and dialogue  reconciliation and forgiveness were the tools needed for peacebuilders and nation builders. He noted the strategic location of Somalia as the gateway between the Arabian peninsula and the African continent.  Defeat of Al-Shabaab could not be met with other extremist groups finding fertile ground in the country.  Somalia needed to be strengthened to prevent another invasion by violent extremists who spread an ideology of death.  People had to be allowed to determine their own future and to benefit from proper application of the rule of law and human rights.  Vision 2016 aimed to deliver peace and sustainable security  outlining federalism through reconciliation  adoption of a revised permanent Constitution and the path to elections.  Noting progress made  including completion of the Constitution Review and Implementation Commission  adoption of the Provisional Federal Constitution and work to create a Boundaries and Federation Commission and National Independent Electoral Commission  he said “we must not fail to deliver on our ambition”. The Somali National Forces had been an important component to defeating Al-Shabaab  he stressed.  The humanitarian situation remained critical  though  with 3.2 million needing immediate assistance and conditions approaching the seriousness of the horrific famine of 2011.  A million people were displaced and a sustained and scaled-up response was required to prevent “free fall”.  The humanitarian appeal remained underfunded  receiving only 32 per cent of what had been requested.  With such recorded progress  it was vital to address the problem; otherwise  those many gains could be eroded.  Continued success required international support  alongside the commitment and ownership of the Somali people.  “This is not the time for scepticism ” he stated.  Democratization and reconciliation would be reached through dialogue  inclusive politics and building of a shared vision on the country's future. TOMISLAV NIKOLIĆ  President of Serbia  said that climate change was one of today’s most urgent global challenges.  The effects of natural disasters had strained the fragile economic situation in Serbia  along with the rest of South-Eastern Europe  and made the struggle against poverty ever more difficult.  Initiatives aimed at alleviating the effects of climate change were imperative  particularly those targeting underdeveloped nations.  With the Climate Change Conference in Paris approaching  there was a unique opportunity this year to devise policies that would lay the groundwork for substantive global action.  An important mechanism in the implementation of that process was the Green Climate Fund  which  by 2020  would achieve its ambitious fund-raising goal. In terms of national priorities  Serbia was seeking to achieve a political solution to the question of Kosovo and Metohija  he said.  For Serbia  the only acceptable and fair solution to that issue was to reject secessionism and preserve the territorial integrity of all countries.  Through dialogue with representatives of the Provisional Institutions of Self-government in Pristina  Serbia was committed to reaching a political agreement that satisfied all parties.  The normalization of relations between Belgrade and Pristina could be largely attributed to the European integration process.  With its active engagement  the European Union could encourage compliance with the obligations outlined in the Brussels Agreement  and help strengthen mutual trust.  For its part  Serbia had met all of its commitments and was open to continued dialogue with Pristina  at all levels. A key factor in the normalization of relations between Belgrade and Pristina  he said  was the return of internally displaced persons.  The world must not forget that Serbia was the country with the largest number of internally displaced persons in Europe  an amount totalling 230 000  including 58 000 refugees.  Today  15 years after the adoption of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)  the conditions for the return of internally displaced persons to Kosovo and Metohija had not yet been created.  The plight of refugees deserved special attention  he said  deploring the serious problems facing those vulnerable persons.  Any decisions made by the United Nations on the issue must not undermine the reconciliation process  or the fundamental right of Serbs to return to their homes in Kosovo and Metohija  Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Serbia’s top foreign policy priority was membership in the European Union  he said  as that would help modernization and economic development in his country.  In turn  Serbia endeavoured to be a respectable member of the family of European nations.  It was preparing to preside over the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) next year  a role through which it aimed to strengthen mutual cooperation and encourage reconciliation in the Balkans. MICHEL JOSEPH MARTELLY  President of Haiti  underscored the productive negotiations with the Dominican Republic towards resolving issues and misunderstandings that were over half a century old.  The voluntary discussions had resulted in agreement on some issues that previously had not been so easy to resolve.  Because negotiation and peaceful resolution of disputes were crucial and the United Nations was vital to the maintenance of peace  enlightened voices had to continue that work  and reform of the Organization was an important aspect of that.  The Security Council was in need of new members  particularly as inclusion was a central part of the Charter.  Its legitimacy and credibility depended on its ability to act efficiently and rapidly while recognizing the value that each individual State added.  That was particularly important in crises like disease outbreaks  and he singled out Cuba for its efforts to unite countries to respond to nations affected by Ebola. The people of Haiti were at a key moment in their march towards stability and implementation of democratic institutions  he went on to say.  After two decades marked by catastrophes of all types  there had been irrefutable progress in the previous three years on democratic consolidation  institution-building  poverty eradication and human rights protection  during which time sustainable growth and development was simultaneously proceeding.  The road ahead was long  but the obstacles surmountable.  The security situation had improved thanks to many Government efforts to strengthen national peace  and Haiti was now one of the most secure States in the Caribbean.  In light of that  he called for the continued  progressive withdrawal of United Nations troops  with Haiti's police filling many roles previously held by United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Describing progress made  he said that 5 per cent of GDP had been dedicated to education  with expanded free access to primary education.  Work to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and efforts against AIDS  malaria and sexually transmitted infections were ongoing  with more health centres available.  Infant and maternal mortality had been reduced  and many buildings vital to the health infrastructure had been built or rehabilitated.  He urged a decisive commitment from the United Nations on cholera  calling for contributions to the national plan to eradicate the disease.  Important economic reforms were being instituted to improve the business environment  while the increased flows of capital and tourists to Haiti illustrated the improving economic climate. Free elections would be held as soon as possible  he said  noting his own role in guaranteeing the stability of institutions.  He had spared no effort in finding consensus between organizations and institutions involved in arranging elections.  Awaiting the summit on Sustainable Development Goals in 2015  he expressed his administration’s confidence in the goals.  Resources were available and the challenge was finding a just and equitable way to share them.  His country would contribute and the United Nations had to be strengthened to better complete the mission.  That could form the basis of a mission to improve security and solidarity and to secure peace worldwide. EMANUEL MORI  President of Micronesia  underscored that the small island developing States had brought the issue of climate change to the attention of the United Nations 30 years ago.  Others could speak of that as a future threat  but small island developing States were already facing the impacts  which were worse than science had predicted.  A small increase in sea-levels would be a catastrophe for the atolls in Micronesia. For small islands to survive  he continued  the Alliance of Small Island States advocated for limiting global warming well below a 1.5˚C increase above the pre-industrial temperature.  That required immediate action from all stakeholders  he stated  voicing support for the World Bank initiative on carbon pricing.  Micronesia had also proposed an amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons  which  along with reduction of other short-lived climate pollutants  could reduce the rate of sea-level rise by 25 per cent  giving the atolls a chance to survive.  He called on world leaders to adopt the proposed amendment. The best small island nations could do on the ground was to anticipate and adapt to climate change and install disaster risk reduction and response policies  he said  which Micronesia had done.  He further stressed the critical importance of implementing the Samoa Pathway  to stimulate sustainable development in small island developing States through durable and genuine partnerships.  Endorsing the proposed Sustainable Development Goals  he also called on development partners to assist in the implementation of Micronesia’s national energy policy. Regarding oceans and fisheries  he said foreign vessels  which enjoyed unprecedented returns from harvesting his country’s exclusive economic zone  must help maintain the health  productivity and resilience of the ocean  and fairly compensate Micronesia for the value of its resources.  Further  illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing must be stopped.  Widespread cooperation and support was also needed to tackle the leading cause of death in the Pacific  non-communicable diseases.  He further urged the establishment of a “One UN” approach for the North Pacific.  The current United Nations Joint Presence in the region must be made more efficient at the country level. Noting that the United Nations target for ODA was 0.7 per cent of GDP for development assistance  he said that most developed nations fell far short of that goal.  He made an urgent call for delivery of real money from the major economic Powers who were also the major polluters.  He also looked to development partners to accelerate implementation of the country’s new telecommunications system.  In addition  it would be inconceivable to have a reformed Security Council without permanent seats for Japan  Germany  Brazil and India  as well as representation from Africa. CHARLES ANGELO SAVARIN  President of Dominica  said that 20 years after the adoption of the Barbados Programme of Action and 10 years after the approval of the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation  most of the commitments made to help promote sustainable development in small island developing States had not yet been delivered.  Hopefully  the outcome of the recently concluded third United Nations Conference on Small Island Developing States would create a new impetus to address those implementation gaps.  That Conference had established the “SIDS DOCK”  an initiative to create a global organization for the development of sustainable energy for those States. Fifteen years after the Millennium Declaration  only a few in the developing world had registered tangible gains  he said  adding that the majority continued to wait for the promised improvements in their living conditions.  However  Dominica had been able to achieve most of the Millennium Development Goals  with notable progress in reducing poverty  improving access to education  ensuring environmental sustainability and building strong bilateral and multilateral partnerships.  Dominica's achievements in education had surpassed the Goals’ targets  and the country could now boast universal access at the early childhood  primary and secondary school levels.  Access to post-secondary education was also available to all secondary school graduates. He said Dominica had always been guided by the principle of sustainable use of its national resources and protection of its physical environment  which was why it was called “the Nature Island of the Caribbean”.  In its efforts to ensure environmental sustainability and rid the island of reliance on fossil fuels  Dominica had invested in renewable energy  and today  about 20 per cent of the island's electricity needs were met from “clean” hydropower.  So far  the country had invested over $20 million in it geothermal resources  and production results indicated that the geothermal reservoir had capacity to generate sufficient electricity for domestic consumption. Despite achievements  however  the world was a long way from where it aspired to be  he said.  The spectre of the deadly Ebola disease and the scourge of HIV/AIDS and non-communicable diseases had significant potential impacts and threatened the gains made so far by small island developing States.  The myriad existing challenges called for global action to protect those gains.  The impact of climate change remained an existential threat to people throughout the world who called small island developing States their home.  The islands of the Caribbean were also prone to earthquakes  droughts and torrential rains with their accompanying landslides and flash flooding — phenomena made worse by climate change.  Natural disasters severely damaged efforts to bring about social and economic development  he added. Dominica joined the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in calling for development partners to conduct their macroeconomic and trade policies in a way that would facilitate opportunities and promote growth for small island developing States  he said.  That new criterion must take into account those States’ inherent vulnerabilities.  In that vein  he added that the economic embargo against Cuba remained of concern.  The unilateral action of the United States could not be justified today.  Similarly  the events in Ukraine were a “proxy tug of war” between the European Union and the United States on the one hand  and the Russian Federation on the other.  The United Kingdom  due to its current situation with regard to Scottish independence  was uniquely placed to counsel the European Union  United States  Kyiv and Moscow  to accord the people of Ukraine the same opportunity to decide their own destiny. GJORGE IVANOV  President of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  said that recent natural disasters around the world  including in his region  were part of an alarming new reality that would transform the lives of future generations.  His was the first country in South-East Europe to have completed its third national report for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Additionally  it had taken steps in all key sectors of its economy and society to mitigate the effects of climate change  including reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing energy efficiency. He said the rule of law was impossible without respect for human rights.  As a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council  his country was committed to protecting and promoting human rights and dignity worldwide.  Thanks to its own model of coexistence  which was based on respect for diversity  the country held itself to the highest standards in that regard.  At the same time  however  the Macedonian people were being denied those rights  including the right to self-determination  in the country’s effort to join the European Union.  Forcing his country to give up its identity to meet the conditions of membership in the Union would breach the United Nations’ founding principle. His country  he noted  also had refused to change its identity as a precondition for membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  It took that stand on the basis of international law  which  he said  was the only thing that provided “predictability and certainty in this world order”.  On that basis  the International Court of Justice had advised in 2011 that blocking his country’s integration into NATO was illegal.  His country was ready to find a mutually acceptable resolution within the framework of international law.  As such  he urged the United Nations to devote its maximum attention to the issue. Drawing attention to issues involving youth  he said that young people were victims of the violations in international order made by past and present generations.  Unless action was taken  they would remain victims of unjust systems.  His country was taking a leadership role on the matter  and together  with the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  would organize next year’s dialogue of civilizations.  That forum would be dedicated entirely to young people.  To enhance dialogue and education on the issue  he proposed the establishment of an office for young Europeans of South-East Europe  and called on world leaders to devote more time and attention to youth. IKILILOU DHOININE  President of Comoros  said that the current session  on the eve of the Organization's seventieth anniversary  was an opportunity to evaluate its performance and harness the process that would make 2015 the year of reform.  In so doing  consideration must be given to the new problems facing the fragile small island developing States and the recommendations resulting from the recent conference in Samoa.  Ways needed to be found to better represent developing countries  particularly those in Africa  which encompassed areas of appreciable economic growth  but also great poverty and bloody conflicts that delayed their development and the well-being of their people. At the same time  he continued  the Security Council must assume coordination of the fight against terrorism.  In that context  he called for an urgent solution to the problem of Palestine  particularly following the latest bloody attacks on Gaza  which was almost as old as the Organization.  In a changing world  he stressed the importance of prevention in consolidating peace  while trying to resolve crises as they arose. Turning to his own country  he noted that  although Comoros had been admitted to the United Nations in 1975  the process of the country's decolonization remained to be completed.  A joint high-level council  envisioned in Paris  had been established  holding its first meeting in November 2013.  Among other issues it would deal with was the movement of Comorians among the four islands of the archipelago.  That would help address ending the tragedies  unnoticed by the international community  that Comorian families faced daily.  Dialogue between the two parties was urgently needed to put an end to that human drama.  He had requested the support of the Indian Ocean Commission  of which both Comoros and France were members  to help end a dispute that had lasted for some 40 years. The Millennium Development Goals were a global covenant of solidarity for the socioeconomic progress of developing countries  he went on to say.  The Comoros had made strides in achieving those goals  among them women's greater participation in political and economic life  maternal health  infant mortality  the fight against HIV/AIDS and equality in children's education  among others.  However  in the areas of food security  environmental degradation  energy  access to clean water and others  much remained to be done. For that reason  he urged the incorporation of the unimplemented Millennium Development Goals into the Sustainable Development Goals  further calling for reinforcement of strategic partnerships  a fair international trade regime  the promotion of direct investments and greater engagement in the fight against climate change.  It was urgent to implement the recommendations of the various conferences on climate  notably the recent conference in Samoa and the summit that had just taken place in New York. While there were numerous signs of economic growth in the countries of Africa  he said  the continent must meet the challenges presented to resolve conflicts and multiple threats to its peace and security.  That required international cooperation.  In that context  he singled out the alarming speed with which the Ebola virus was spreading  hailing the measures taken by many countries recently. CHRISTOPHER J. LOEAK  President of the Marshall Islands  said that climate change posed no greater threat in the world than on its Pacific shores.  As a low-lying nation  his had no higher ground and  ultimately  nowhere to go.  Leaders could not afford “consensus games and squabbling” on that issue as words and intentions alone would not meet the major challenges ahead.  Without action  he warned  it would not be possible to reach the carbon emission targets necessary to save his nation.  Direct political ownership and “creative political solutions” were needed to meet that global challenge. To that end  he said  the Marshall Islands strongly supported the call for a global phase-down of hydrofluorocarbon gases under the Montreal Protocol and would participate in the upcoming Climate Conference in Paris to carry the voice of its people.  Although that was a global fight  it was one that truly hit home.  Pushing back rising waters was crucial to saving countries’ future.  Leaders must respond to the climate change threat with courage and not simply “bury their heads in the sand to an obvious climate reality”  he urged. The Marshall Islands stood firm with fellow Pacific leaders in their call for a United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on oceans  he said  adding that the Pacific Ocean and its rich fisheries was their lifeline.  Protecting the world’s vast blue water should be a priority as it represented two thirds of the world’s surface and would help address global food security.  Fishing nations must look beyond their immediate needs and towards their global responsibility.  Recent progress on sustainable fishing had helped empower Pacific nations  he said  adding that oceans were equally valuable as a resource for alternate sustainable energy  including ocean thermal energy conversion. As a country which had had 67 nuclear tests conducted on its soil  the Marshall Islands was also concerned about nuclear proliferation  he said.  Today  the country still bore the burden and impacts of those tests.  Awareness of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons must underpin all disarmament efforts  he stressed.  The Marshall Islands looked forward to addressing those issues during its participation next year in the United Nations Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review.  The United Nations should not only stop the spread of nuclear weapons  but should pursue a world without them. ANOTE TONG  President of Kiribati  said those on the frontlines of climate change welcomed the renewed focus and rallying by Member States at this week's Climate Change Summit.  The real challenge was in translating those commitments and announcements into action.  Successful conferences did  however  signify the United Nations' recognition of the need to highlight the special cases of those States and to re-focus global attention to the prevailing socioeconomic and environmental challenges that continued to constrain the efforts of small island developing States. Climate change remained the biggest threat to mankind  he said.  The international community could not afford to ignore the stories of island States like his regarding the plight of their people; that plight would be the world’s further down the line.  He had personally just returned from an expedition to the North Pole and was “still overwhelmed” by what he witnessed there with his own eyes.  The melting of massive sheets of ice in the Arctic region due to climate change would not only have severe impacts on the lives of people in that region  but would also result in the demise of future generations in other parts of the globe. For Kiribati  climate change was not an event in the future  he said.  Rather  it was an event his country was dealing with today  and the international community could not talk about sustainable development without talking about climate change.  Kiribati was taking responsibility for its own well-being and sustainable development needs  with climate change and adaptation measures integrated into the national budgeting process and development programmes to strengthen disaster risk management.  The “migration with dignity” strategy was an investment in the education of Kiribati's people  equipping youth with qualifications and employable skills to help them migrate with dignity to other countries. In July  he said  Kiribati and other low-lying atoll island States  including Tuvalu  Marshall Islands  Maldives and Tokelau  had formed a Coalition of low-lying Atoll Nations  called “CANCC” or “can see”.  That initiative aimed to highlight urgent action that must be taken now to assist those countries and all vulnerable communities to adapt to the impacts of climate change. He further said that the ocean played a pivotal role in the sustainable development of his country  hinged on a “blue economy” and on the sustainable management of marine and ocean resources.  While Kiribati had been labelled a “small island developing State”  it was in fact a “large ocean State”  spanning an ocean area of 3.5 million square kilometres.  The ocean had been an integral part of Kiribati life from time immemorial  and while it posed a serious threat to survival now from sea level rise  it also provided immense opportunities through which to realize sustainable development and livelihood. Human activities were responsible for the accelerated degradation of the global environment in the pursuit of short-term economic gains  which had been done without due regard to the health of oceans and the environment  he said.  Never before in history had the health of the oceans and planet been so challenged.  The international community shared responsibility and obligations to protect the ocean and to sustainably manage its biodiversity from further detrimental degradation.  Kiribati would be closing off the Phoenix Islands Protected Area in January 2015 from all commercial fishing.  That area was approximately 11 per cent of Kiribati's exclusive economic zone  and was about the size of California. The closure would entail a loss of much-needed revenue for Kiribati.  However  it was a major — but necessary — short-term sacrifice for the long-term health of the ocean and for sustainable fish stocks and global food security. SUSHIL KOIRALA  Prime Minister of Nepal  said that terrorism was anathema to humanity  and was a serious threat to peace  security and development.  He shared concerns over the growing scourge of terrorism  extremism and religious fundamentalism and urged an early conclusion of the comprehensive convention on international terrorism and the effective implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.  Terrorism could be better tackled under the aegis of the United Nations with a coordinated global response. He said that peacekeeping had emerged as a central activity and innovative tool to deal with threats to peace and security.  Nepal was proud to have long contributed to United Nations peacekeeping operations in troubled parts of the world.  Nepal was the fifth largest troop contributor  and Nepalese blue helmets had been commended for performing extremely well in trying circumstances and would continue to participate  as well as to promote gender equality through women’s increased participation. Speaking to other issues  he said that international peace and security could not be achieved amid the continuing arms race  and he was concerned by the lack of progress in major multilateral negotiations on the issue.  He also was concerned at the illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons  and called on all member States to step up disarmament measures.  He also spoke to the Ebola epidemic  which had taken the form of a global public health emergency.  The United Nations and the WHO must address symptoms and root causes in a coordinated manner. Nepal remained fully committed to the protection and promotion of human rights and had put the required institutional mechanisms in place  he said.  Nepal strongly believed in the universality  indivisibility  non-selectivity and interdependent character of all human rights  including the right to development.  He especially underlined the need to ensure the rights and well-being of migrant workers  and said it was necessary to define the roles and responsibilities of the countries of origin  transit and destination to safeguard migrants’ basic rights. In its seven decades  the United Nations had been found to be the most successful when the letter and spirit of its Charter was honoured  he said.  Indeed  the real solutions to world problems lay in strengthening and extending the authority of the United Nations. IRAKLI GARIBASHVILI  Prime Minister of Georgia  said that  despite significant progress  his country was still a young democracy and took nothing for granted.  In tough times  the public protested and cast votes at the ballot box to ensure continued democracy  and steps had since been taken to break cycles of corruption and impunity  and to make the economy more inclusive.  Governance and the rule of law were stronger  and he celebrated recent elections and stressed that his Government would be accountable.  Democratic institutions were being strengthened and a new Constitution had been approved.  Parliament acted as a proper legislature and was no longer a “rubber stamp”.  A human rights strategy and action plan  anti-discrimination laws and an independent judiciary were all in effect and the media and civil society were playing a greater role. He said that efforts towards NATO membership were accompanied by an Association Agreement with the European Union to gradually establish European political  economic  social and legislative norms and standards.  Georgia’s democratic transformation could serve as a model for other countries.  The economy was opening  with investment and reforms  and the Government would implement the new development agenda and take seriously the “Rio+20” outcomes.  Social equity and protection of the environment were also important to economic growth  as were gender equality  women’s empowerment and a concentration on youth. Internally displaced persons and refugees were major concerns for Georgia  he said  noting increased numbers arriving from the Middle East and Ukraine.  His country gave political and technical assistance to Ukraine and supported its territorial integrity and sovereignty.  The General Assembly resolution on internally displaced persons and refugees from Georgia was welcome  and he was committed to restoring Georgia's full territorial integrity and sovereignty.  Efforts to improve relations with the Russian Federation were ongoing under a two-track approach.  On the one hand  “significant results” had been achieved in the pursuit of resumed trade  and economic  cultural and humanitarian relations  but in terms of pursuing Russian respect for the 2008 ceasefire and troop withdrawal  Georgia's efforts had not met the same spirit of cooperation.  Georgia was the largest non-NATO troop contributor to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)  and he looked forward to NATO membership.  Georgian troops were also part of the European Union deployment to the Central African Republic. He was committed  he said  to using Georgia’s strategic location to connect Asia  Europe and the Middle East.  The “Silk Road” had reopened  which he believed was among the greatest post-cold war achievements.  To unlock its full potential  the international community should redouble efforts on trade and transport  energy and people-to-people contacts.  Georgia had deepened cooperation with countries on the Silk Road  he said  adding that transport and energy links were key to economic development and integration.  In that connection  Georgia supported a route for Caspian Sea oil and gas to reach Europe.  Noting the massive expansion of the South Caucasus Pipeline through Azerbaijan and Georgia  he said it was bringing 16 billion cubic metres of new natural gas to Europe and Turkey  and thousands of new jobs to Georgia.  He looked forward to the Silk Road Forum in 2015 to enhance cooperation.  Georgia would seek to install clean and renewable energy  especially hydropower  in order to become carbon neutral  he added. ELIO DI RUPO  Prime Minister of Belgium  named four people who had been murdered 24 May simply for being in the Jewish Museum in Brussels  but he also recalled the many killed by terrorists  in Iraq  Syria and elsewhere.  Foreign fighters among them constituted a threat to all people.  The recent resolution adopted by the Security Council was a start to addressing that threat.  In that context  Belgium had decided to send six F-16 fighters to combat terrorism in Iraq.  As stated in the resolution  efforts must be taken to prevent candidates for Jihad from reaching combat zones.  Each country must be vigilant on border control  particularly with regard to minors.  The fight was a conflict between those who valued human life  freedom  and tolerance  and the terrorists who did not.  Education was important to de-radicalize the radicals. Political authorities who had favoured military actions  the famous “preventive war”  in which Belgium refused to participate  bore some responsibility.  “How could we not see that such a war would create more radicals? ” he asked.  Strengthening the rule of law and improving living conditions were the best crisis management and were more cost-effective than managing violence.  In the Middle East  he said  Belgium had watched in despair the launch of rockets into Israel and the massive bombing of Gaza.  War was not the answer to create two States living in peace.  The settlement of that conflict must be moved back to the top of the international agenda and the international community must do everything to further peace and prosperity. Elsewhere  he said that support was needed in Africa for educational and economic development.  In the Democratic Republic of the Congo it was urgent to put armed groups far from where they could do harm  and support must be mobilized for populations dealing with Ebola.  There was destabilization on the edges of Europe as well  where recognized borders were being disturbed.  Concerning Malaysia Airlines flight 17  in which Belgian citizens had died  he urgently awaited the report of the independent experts who must have free access to the site. There would only be peace if tolerance ruled  he said.  The role of the United Nations in the settlement of conflicts was irreplaceable as it was the only place the world's representatives could get together.  Too many were living in poverty  had no access to safe water or health services  among other things.  There would be no human progress without a normalization of global finance.  Too many women and men had no access to work or housing because they were of foreign origin; too many women faced violence for being women; and too many were discriminated against because they were homosexual  lesbian or loved differently. Belgium was one of the most open countries in the world  he said.  It was a wealthy country  yet it had the smallest inequalities in Europe due to its State policies.  All had access to excellent health care  for example.  There was great ethnic diversity  including through immigration.  It was important not to fall into the trap of social aggression that increased inequality.  Human brotherhood was not a utopia  but it was what had allowed humans to progress.  Human brotherhood was the most powerful thing that would allow all people to share the environment and ensure that peace reigned everywhere. KAMLA PERSAD-BISSESSAR  Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago  said that her country was poised to achieve 70 per cent of the 43 targets across eight Millennium Development Goals  which were relevant in the national context.  Forty-two per cent of those targets had already been met  and 28 per cent were likely to be achieved by 2015.  It was possible to advance the original objectives before the end of the year with more dedicated effort.  Some of the gaps included access to affordable essential medicines and long-term debt sustainability. At the Rio+20 Conference in 2012  her country had agreed on many of the foundation elements of the post-2015 development agenda  she said.  Those included the Secretary-General’s Global Sustainability Report  the sustainable development goals  the Report of the Intergovernmental Committee on Sustainable Development Financing  and outcomes of the structured dialogues on a specialized technology mechanism and the 10-year framework of programmes for sustainable development. She said the international community  together with the institutional support of the high-level political forum on sustainable development  the reformed Economic and Social Council and the United Nations Environmental Assembly  had a solid foundation on which to build a global partnership in support of poverty eradication though sustainable development.  Her country looked forward to the synthesized report of the Secretary-General  which should place all those elements in the context of a fully integrated new development agenda.  It was a priority to revitalize global partnership in support of sustainable development  reform the international financial institutions  and complete the Doha Round of trade talks.  It was also important  she stressed  to address the mitigation gap for achieving the 2°C target for limiting the increase in global greenhouse gas emissions as well as for achieving an ambitious legally binding agreement on climate change.  Such an agreement should set the world on track to achieve carbon neutrality by 2070 and  by so doing  ensure that global climate would support the sustainable development of present as well as future generations. She shared the vision with other Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Heads of State and Government of a Caribbean region that was integrated  inclusive and resilient  and which was driven by knowledge  innovation and productivity  where every citizen was secure and had the opportunity to realize his or her potential.  Such a community would be a unified and competitive force in the global arena. ELMAR MAHARRAM OGLU MAMMADYAROV  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan  said that his country’s record in attaining the Millennium Goals was unique.  GDP had increased 3.4 times over the last 10 years  with the country’s economy now accounting for more than 80 per cent of that of the South Caucasus.  The poverty rate had fallen from 49 per cent in 2004 to 5.3 per cent in 2014  while unemployment had dropped from 10.6 per cent to 5 per cent in that time.  That rapid development had enabled Azerbaijan to become an emerging donor of ODA. Azerbaijan  he noted  had also established itself as a reliable supplier of energy in the global market.  A ground-breaking ceremony had recently been held launching the Southern Gas Corridor  which would allow Europe to receive gas from a completely new resource base in Azerbaijan.  The country had also initiated a trans-Eurasian information super highway to provide ICT services to the region. Noting that violence and fragility remained the greatest obstacles to development  he said that the world community faced serious breaches of the fundamental norms and principles of international law.  In that context  he spoke of Armenia’s breach of Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity  about which the Security Council had adopted four resolutions in 1993.  Unfortunately  Armenia had disregarded them all.  It was crucial for the international community to play a proactive role in ending impunity for the crimes committed by Armenia against the civilian population of Azerbaijan.  The principle of self-determination required the return of displaced Azerbaijanis to the Nagorno-Karabakh region  where they would live with the Armenian community in peace  dignity and prosperity within Azerbaijan. ERLAN A. IDRISSOV  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan  said that “unilateral actions and double standards” had destabilized the world  exacerbating ethnic tensions and threatening global security.  Of particular concern was the situation in Ukraine  which was affecting the entire region and had led to sanctions imposed by countries that made up 60 per cent of the world's GDP.  Kazakhstan supported initiatives aimed at the de-escalation of the conflict  including the Minsk peace agreements  which gave hope for long-term stability. No country should act unilaterally  he said.  To adjust to a “new  multi-polar world order”  Kazakhstan proposed the G-Global initiative  which would promote tolerance  transparency  trust and “constructive multilateralism”.  At this turbulent time  there was a need for new approaches and bold actions to address the world's problems.  His country encouraged Member States to use G-Global to draw up plans that would address future global crises.  Building on momentum it had garnered at the Astana Economic Forum  he encouraged the General Assembly to consider adopting that framework. Having lived with the effects of nuclear testing  Kazakhstan was determined to promote awareness on the perils of those weapons  he said.  Non-proliferation remained one of the most important priorities of Kazakhstan's foreign policy.  His country’s President had launched the ATOM (Abolish Testing Our Mission) Project  a global education campaign that called for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) to be entered into force as soon as possible.  The signing of the Semipalatinsk Treaty by the Permanent Five marked a major landmark in nuclear security and it was now time for those countries to ratify the protocol as soon possible.  The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) remained the cornerstone of the non-proliferation movement  and he encouraged all to uphold the provisions of the NPT and work towards ratification of the CTBT. ABDULAZIZ KAMILOV  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uzbekistan  said that the world’s escalating conflicts could only be resolved through political means and strict observance to the fundamental principles of international law as enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  The continued instability in Afghanistan posed a serious threat to the security of Central Asia and the wider region.  Peace in that country could not be achieved by military force  he said  adding that the Afghan people were tired of bloodshed and had a right to determine their own fate.  Uzbekistan adhered to a policy of non-interference and would instead support Afghanistan through mutually-beneficial bilateral relations. Against the ensuing global financial crisis  regional economic cooperation would help ensure stability and sustainable development in Central Asia  he said.  Large infrastructure projects  particularly in transport and communication  would connect the region with global markets  promote economic cooperation  and boost interregional trade.  Upcoming projects include a transport corridor linking the countries of the Central Asian region to the Middle East through the shortest  most reliable and secure route.  Uzbekistan’s assistance in the construction of the Khairaton-Mazaree-Sharif railroad — the first linking Afghanistan with the external world — would also be a landmark event  he said. Like many other countries in the world  Uzbekistan experienced a shortage of water  he said.  Fair and reasonable usage was vital to the livelihoods of people in Central Asia.  Issues must be resolved in line with international laws and norms  with clearly defined principles that protected the environment as well as the interests of neighbours.  Large hydropower projects that disturbed the natural flow of transnational rivers created a threat to the water  food and environmental safety of the region and could provoke tension  he added. Robust economic development had allowed Uzbekistan to implement the Millennium Development Goals ahead of schedule.  Since independence  the Uzbek economy had grown nearly five-fold  which had led to a marked improvement in quality of life.  Around 60 per cent of State expenditures were channelled into social development  including education and maternal health  he reported.  As such  the mortality rate among children below age 5 had decreased significantly  as had maternal mortality.  Continuing on that success  Uzbekistan looked forward to achieving the post-2015 development goals ahead of schedule as well. ALI AHMED KARTI  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sudan  described his country's political transition  noting that President Omer al-Bashir had established national dialogue on such topics as rights  foreign relations  and the economy.  The Government and opposition were aiming to agree on a way forward for Sudan.  Sanctions against the country should be lifted and its debt forgiven  he stressed  describing the positive role Sudan was playing in the peace and security of its neighbours.  There had been no interference when conflict broke out in South Sudan  he noted.  Instead  Sudan had provided humanitarian aid and accepted 100 000 internally displaced persons.  Efforts were also made to help resolve conflicts in the Central African Republic and Libya  while cooperation with Ethiopia and Egypt continued to ensure universal benefits from the Blue Nile.  On Palestine  he urged support for Palestinian demands  saying that failure to protect them fuelled global extremism.  Noting support for the post-2015 development agenda  he pointed to the unanimous agreement on ideas for international partnerships to end poverty and suffering  which were part of the Millennium Declaration.  Achievements had fallen short  with some development partners taking actions that ran counter to the Declaration.  The imposition of unilateral sanctions was especially damaging.  Sudan's efforts to eradicate poverty had received support from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.  Affirming that common responsibility was needed to pursue development  he stressed the importance of cancelling debts  transferring technology  North-South cooperation  and allowing the United Nations to play a role.  He underlined the need for global cooperation in tackling climate change and terrorism.  Unilateral efforts could not eradicate  but only aggravate  terrorism. CARLOS RAÚL MORALES  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guatemala  said that his country had begun to prevail in the battle against chronic malnourishment in children.  In one year  the programme  known as “Zero Hunger”  had managed to reduce chronic malnourishment by 2 per cent  which was the same reduction as that achieved in the previous decade.  Should that trend be maintained  the current Administration in Guatemala would have reduced that problem beyond what had been achieved since 1985. He said that the number of homicides in Guatemala for the third consecutive year had been reduced  coming closer to achieving levels of security last seen after peace accords in 1996.  That advancement showed that the measures put in place were producing the expected results and that Guatemalan democracy was slowly winning its battle against crime and impunity.  His country had also strengthened criminal prosecution of mafia networks.  Further advancements had also been made with regard to business measures  including reducing bureaucratic procedures and improving the country’s infrastructure. In the framework of advances in social and economic development  as well as security  he said it was important to also mention the crisis regarding child migrants such as had occurred on the border between Mexico and the United States.  That crisis required a strategic response which attacked the structural roots of that phenomenon  and which offered sustained actions.  That implied working together to promote greater shared prosperity in Honduras  El Salvador and Guatemala  and a lucid management of temporal work for migrants that satisfied the demands of the labour market in the United States and the supply of workers from Central America.  Additionally  a shortfall of rain this year in the region had led to the loss of crops and food for hundreds of thousands of families.  Addressing the food crisis in Guatemala alone would cost close to $50 million during the next eight months. The shaping of the post-2015 agenda must embrace inclusive and sustainable development goals that promoted justice for all  he said.  Guatemala was committed to addressing the world drug problem  the focus of which must be integral  objective and based on evidence.  The United Nations offered the ideal venue to address such conflicts and tensions  and he reiterated hope that dialogue  agreements and preventive diplomacy took precedence over the use of force. HARRY KALABA  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Zambia  expressed deep concern about the Ebola outbreak  which he described as a “common challenge to humanity”.  Zambia was ready to support efforts in defeating the virus and bringing back normalcy to the affected African States.  That global health emergency  along with other public health challenges  such as malaria  tuberculosis  and AIDS  required a concerted  unified approach. He said his country supported ongoing discussions related to the post-2015 development agenda  notably those relating to population and development  labour  and climate change.  Zambia was also focused on the growing problem of early and forced marriages  which was rooted in poverty and exploitation.  As such  it had hosted a national symposium on the issue and taken several other initiatives to reduce the gender divide. It looked forward to working with other nations to curb incidences of child marriage and promote the advancement of women worldwide.  His country's commitment to women’s empowerment was in line with the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action. The question of Security Council reform remained an important priority for Zambia  which was concerned at the minimal progress made towards its expansion  he said.  As a member of the African Union Committee of Ten on Security Council reform  Zambia urged the body to make long-overdue reforms and reiterated the importance of the issue to other African States.  To that end  the continent was committed to all five clusters of the intergovernmental negotiation process outlined in General Assembly Decision 62/557 (2008)  he added. Right of Reply Speaking in exercise of the right of reply  the representative of India responded to “unwarranted references” made by Pakistan's Prime Minister in his speech  stressing that Jammu and Kashmir had peacefully chosen their future.  He rejected in their entirety the comments made. The representative of Armenia  also speaking in exercise of the right of reply  said Azerbaijan’s statement relied on falsified information.  They repeated the same lies yearly  so he wondered if the leadership now believed what they were saying.  He provided several examples that he said refuted what Azerbaijan claimed and called on Azerbaijan to engage constructively on the basis of principles of sovereignty  territorial integrity  non-use of force or the threat of force. The representative of Azerbaijan took the floor in exercise of the right of reply  pointing to a “moral and legal irresponsibility” on the part of Armenia.  Four United Nations resolutions were the most authoritative rulings on the situation  all demanding the withdrawal of Armenia’s occupying forces.  No withdrawal was happening.  A state of aggression continued because of the ongoing occupation.  The representative had referred to self-determination  but the Armenian ethnic minority did not fit into any of the three categories recognized as being entitled to self-determination.  The representative of Armenia took to the floor for a second time  stressing that the people of Nagorno-Karabakh had been clear about their wishes and that any aggression against them would be considered as such.  Armenians might not have been the majority population in Azerbaijan  but they were the majority population in Nagorno-Karabakh.  He described Armenia’s efforts to integrate Azeri refugees and stressed that no Azeri had any historical  legal or moral right to tell Nagorno-Karabakh how to live or how independent they should be. The representative of Azerbaijan also took to the floor for a second time  saying the claim of Nagorno-Karabakh’s independence was “an outright lie”.  Armenia had been responsible for the creation of a “subordinate  puppet regime” and had given vital political  military and economic means to the separatist regime.  She added that the ethnic make-up of the region was due to ethnic cleansing and stated that Armenia’s Head of State took pride in his involvement in atrocities. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-09-25,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11562.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. “If we did what we must  it could be remembered in history as the session that helped us turn the corner in ensuring effective custodianship of the environment  economic justice and social responsibility ” the General Assembly was told today as its annual debate continued. A mixed picture emerged  however  on the world’s state of affairs as leaders called for cooperation to combat terrorism and regional conflicts by eliminating such underlying causes as poverty and addressing global climate change. Pride and optimism were also evident  however  as African delegates took the floor.  The Prime Minister of Ethiopia described Africa as “the rising continent offering tremendous opportunities for trade and investment”.  He stressed that conflict was not an exclusively African phenomenon  underscoring that the threat of terrorism had affected ever greater and wider areas of the world. Indeed  said President John Dramani Mahama of Ghana  Africa was particularly vulnerable to terrorism  as the continent’s sheer size and vast terrain offered innumerable places for terrorists to hide.  Given that more than 60 per cent of Africa’s population was under the age of 35  with many living in extreme poverty  terrorists exploited the ignorance and disillusionment of young people who lacked the skills  education and opportunities to find gainful employment. In that vein  Iran’s President also regretted the spread of terrorism  of the view that it was the strategic mistakes of the West — in the Middle East  Central Asia and the Caucuses — that had turned those parts of the world into a haven for terrorists.  To defeat that scourge  the underlying causes of poverty  unemployment  discrimination and injustice must be addressed  he said  adding that democracy was the product of growth and development  and not something that could be imported from the West to the East. Describing a different kind of battle  the President of Palau said climate change was the planet’s “silent war”.  A temperature increase of 3.6˚C was simply unacceptable  and if that was the best global leaders could do  “we might as well throw in the towel and stop having children  because there will be no future for them”.  However  he said the Pacific region  whose people comprehended first hand the real and present impacts of climate change  would not go down without a fight. Looking forward  the President of Niger said the post-2015 agenda would be dominated by the three “Ds”:  defence  democracy and development.  He urged the world community to stand in greater solidarity.  He agreed it was vital to address climate change because environmental issues  such as the decrease in rainfall in the Sahel region and the frequency of floods and drought  had exacerbated poverty and had consequently caused the youth to turn to terrorism and organized crime. Other speakers today included the Heads of State and Government of Albania  Antigua and Barbuda  Australia  Brunei Darussalam  Bulgaria  Canada  Colombia  Croatia  Democratic Republic of the Congo  Gabon  Gambia  Hungary  Italy  Japan  Kuwait  Latvia  Madagascar  Malawi  Morocco  Nauru  Netherlands  Norway  Panama  Peru  Poland  Romania  Slovakia  Tajikistan  Tunisia  United Republic of Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Also delivering statements were the Foreign Ministers of Cameroon  Republic of Moldova and Senegal. The President of the European Council also spoke. The Assembly will meet again at 9 a.m. tomorrow to continue its general debate. Statements MAHAMADOU ISSOUFOU  President of Niger  said that sociopolitical crises  religious extremism  armed conflict  terrorism  trans-boundary crime  problems of development  climate change and pandemics  such as those caused by the Ebola virus  were concerns of extreme importance today.  In order to meet the challenges of promoting peace  stability  security and development  there must be greater global solidarity and sharing.  Despite the tremendous progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals  such as that of his country  for example  in reducing the number of people suffering from hunger and mortality rates of children under the age of five  vast gaps remained and would remain after the 2015 target date. The post-2015 agenda would be dominated by the three Ds: defence  democracy and development  he said.  Pointing to increasing poverty as well as conflicts around the world  he said the international community must establish a shared goal and strategy to reduce and eradicate those ills.  That must include defending democratic institutions  protecting the people and cutting off financing for terrorism.  Resolving the Palestinian question was also important.  There must be bolstered action to promote national reconciliation in Libya.  He called for increased regional and international cooperation to address the extreme aggression of the Boko Haram militant movement in Nigeria.  On Mali  he welcomed inter-Malian dialogue and hoped it would lead to an agreement that would respect the country’s integrity.  In Mali and the Central African Republic  a “Pandora’s box of Balkanization” must be closed to prevent Africa from going up in flames  he said  stressing that “the future of Africa is in its unity”. The fight against inequality must be made a priority and placed at the centre of the post-2015 development agenda  he said.  With its high economic growth rate  Africa was the continent of the twentieth century.  Indeed  it would be the continent of the twenty-first century when it converted its own raw materials into manufactured goods and took its place in global industrial production  when its relations with other nations were governed by fair trade  not by Official Development Assistance (ODA)  and when a broad middle class would arise thanks to good political and economic governance.  The vision contained in the African Union’s 2063 agenda indicated that Africa was on the right path.  It was in the international community’s interest to mainstream the continent’s priorities. The international community must also address the challenge of climate change  he said.  The drop in rainfall in the Sahel region; the growing spread of desert and sand  as had been seen along the Niger River; the drying up of Chad Lake and the prevalence of floods and drought; among other environmental concerns; had contributed to the impoverishment of people and caused youth to embrace terrorism and organized crime.  In consideration of those challenges  he expressed hope that humanity would create and implement a development model that would save the planet and build a fairer  more humane world. ANDREJ KISKA  President of Slovakia  said that 20 years ago Ukraine had abandoned its nuclear programme in exchange for guarantees of security and territorial integrity.  Today  instead of marking the anniversary of that achievement  they were witnessing an armed conflict and political instability.  His Government strongly denounced the violation of the territorial integrity of any State  with Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea being no exemption.  Only dialogue and a diplomatic solution of the conflict  with Russia’s participation  would lead to sustainable peace in Ukraine. He further warned that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) had become a global threat.  Their ideology and acts represented an unprecedented brutality and twisted use of media for self-promotion.  They embodied ethnic and religious cleansing that would not stop at the borders of Iraq and Syria  but had the ambition to spread beyond the Middle East.  He called on the international community to stand united on Iraq and prevent ISIL from taking hold of the occupied territory and consolidating its military and economic power there. Moving on to Afghanistan  he expressed his conviction that in the aftermath of the recent presidential elections  the country would be able to create conditions to achieve national and societal unity  and continue supporting international assistance.  He was confident that the agreement reached between the two presidential candidates would contribute to the stability of Afghanistan. He highlighted disarmament as key to eliminating potential sources of tension and conflict.  The signing of the Arms Trade Treaty in 2013 had been an important step towards establishing common legal standards for regulating and monitoring the international trade of conventional weapons.  As one of the first of 50 countries to ratify that Treaty  Slovakia was hopeful that its implementation would help to eliminate the risk of the illegal arms trade  thus strengthening global security. JOHN DRAMANI MAHAMA  President of Ghana  said that Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea  the three countries most affected by the Ebola outbreak  had been struggling to rebuild their social and economic infrastructures.  Even before the outbreak  they had been operating with limited resources  an insufficient number of treatment facilities  and a shortage of qualified medical staff.  So far  there had been 5 843 recorded cases of Ebola  of which 2 803 had resulted in death  with the World Health Organization (WHO) predicting that the number of cases could rise to 20 000 by November if the disease was not brought under control.  Ebola was not just a West African problem  but a global one  as it knew no boundaries.  To help the affected countries  Ghana had offered its capital city  Accra  as a base of operations for activities geared towards containing the disease. On terrorism  he highlighted the particular vulnerability of Africa  which  due to its sheer size and vast terrain  offered a myriad of places for terrorists to hide and create safe havens.  With more than 60 per cent of Africa’s population under the age of thirty-five and a significant number living in extreme poverty  terrorists also had the opportunity to recruit by exploiting the ignorance and disillusionment of young people who lacked the skills  education and opportunities to find gainful employment.  The problem had been made even worse with the proliferation of technology  facilitating communication within terrorist cells and between terrorist organizations. On Ghana’s current economic situation  he noted that over the past year his people had seen an increase in the cost of living.  Falling commodity prices had led to a decline in tax revenue from companies operating in the country  as well as to a massive drop in export earnings.  That had contributed to a general sense of macroeconomic instability  and had placed a lot of pressure on Ghana’s currency.  Furthermore  instability in the global commodity markets had directly affected public budgets and  hence  the country’s ability to finance its development. With regard to gender equality  he highlighted Ghana’s commitment to the improvement of women’s lives.  His Administration boasted the highest number of women appointed to public office in the history of Ghana  including seven female Cabinet ministers.  Furthermore  it had submitted to Parliament an Intestate Succession Bill  which ensured that if a spouse died without having written a will  the surviving spouse would not be dispossessed of their marital assets.  Also submitted to Parliament was a Property Rights of Spouses Bill  which ensured that in the case of marriage dissolution  a spouse would be entitled to an equitable portion of the property acquired during the union. HASSAN ROUHANI  President of Iran  said he came from a region of the world whose many parts were currently burning in the fire of extremism and radicalism.  To the east and west of his country  extremists threatened its neighbours and resorted to violence and bloodshed.  They did not speak a “single” language nor were they of a “single” skin colour or nationality; they had come to the Middle East from around the world with a shared ideology of violence and extremism.  Deeply regretful that terrorism had become globalized  he said the extremists of the world had found each other and put out the call “extremists of the world unite”.  To that  he asked  “But are we united against the extremists?” He said that extremism was not a regional issue that only the nations in his region would have to confront.  It was a global issue that certain States had helped create and for which their peoples were paying the price.  Today’s anti-Westernism was the offspring of yesterday’s colonialism and a reaction to yesterday’s racism.  To fight the underlying causes of terrorism  he emphasized that poverty  unemployment  discrimination  humiliation and injustice must be addressed  pointing out that the strategic blunders of the West in the Middle East  Central Asia and the Caucuses had turned those parts of the world into a haven for terrorists and extremists. Military aggression against Afghanistan and Iraq and improper interference in the developments in Syria were clear examples of that erroneous strategic approach in the Middle East  he noted.  Democracy was the product of growth and development  not of war and aggression.  It was not a product that could be commercially imported from the West to the East.  In an underdeveloped society  imported democracy led only to a weak and vulnerable Government.  Further  he warned against the spread of extremism and the danger posed by an inadequate understanding and incorrect approach to that phenomenon  adding that all the nations in the region must exert broad cooperation on social and political as well as security and defence issues to reach a common and durable understanding. He called the continued oppressive sanctions against a moderate and independent Iran a strategic mistake.  In the past year  his country had engaged in transparent dialogue to build confidence regarding its peaceful nuclear programme  noting that only through negotiations could the issue be resolved.  It remained committed to continuing a peaceful nuclear programme and negotiations in earnest and good faith.  However  Iranians could not trust in any security cooperation between their Government and those who had imposed sanctions  creating obstacles to their accessing food and medicine.  Reaching a final nuclear agreement with Iran would be an historic opportunity for the West to show that it did not oppose the advancement and development of others  did not discriminate in adhering to international rules and regulations  demonstrating that the way to resolution was through negotiation and respect  not conflict and sanction. He said his Government’s policy was to work towards constructive interaction with its neighbours on the basis of mutual respect and emphasis on common interests.  The notion that Iran sought to control other Muslim countries in the region was a myth fanned in recent years by an “Iranophobic” project.  In that regard  his Government worked towards putting an end to delusional “Iranophobia”  setting the stage for strategic partnerships with its neighbours.  If the right approach was not taken in dealing with violence and extremism  the international community would find a more turbulent and tumultuous region that would have repercussions for the rest of the world.  However  while the right solution must be one with international support  it must come from within the region  he concluded. MOHAMED MONCEF MARZOUKI  President of Tunisia  said that his country had managed to eliminate a dictatorial regime and begin rebuilding a democratic State through a process of national dialogue.  Tunisia today was a testing ground for sharing authority between secular moderates and Islamists  and was meeting counterrevolution with a response of moderation. The volatile situation in neighbouring Libya was of great concern  he noted.  Tunisia was “appalled” by violence against Christians in the region  and ashamed of acts committed in the name of Allah  who had defined himself as compassionate and merciful.  Nothing justified the violence that had reached horrific levels  he said  condemning the execution of British and French nationals.  What the world was witnessing today was the sum of five decades of despotic policies that had denied rights and freedoms while amassing wealth. The world needed regimes that govern in harmony with their people  the release of all political prisoners  dialogue with all moderates  and an economy that favoured the interests of the majority  he said.  Education that developed minds and “raised the banner of freedom” was also key.  Some major Powers had for decades supported despotism in his country under the pretext of supporting stability. Turning to the situation in other countries  he called for a lifting of the blockade on Gaza  and also for improvement of the situation in Syria.  On United Nations reform  he called for an expansion of the number of permanent members of the Security Council to better reflect the world as it was today  not as it was at the conclusion of the Second World War.  He praised the work of the International Criminal Court and then announced that his country would propose to the United Nations legal organ the creation of an international constitutional court that would be able to issue decisions on “illegitimate  bogus elections”.  This idea had been well-received in international academic forums  he said  expressing wishes that the creation of this court would not take as much time as creating the Criminal Court had taken. JUAN MANUEL SANTOS CALDERÓN  President of Colombia  expressed hope that after more than half a century of conflict Colombia would soon be at peace.  Over the past two years  the peace process between the Government and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group in Havana had produced concrete results.  The two sides had already agreed on three points of a five-point agenda:  comprehensive rural development  political participation and the illicit drug problem.  On the third point  an agreement was reached to continue dismantling the drug mafia  promote a national programme of crop substitution and alternative crop development and address the problem of overconsumption from a public health perspective. Discussions on the remaining points — repercussions for victims of the conflict and the end of conflict itself — were already under way  he said  stressing the importance of victims’ rights to justice  truth and reparation.  A subcommittee comprising active military and police personnel had been created to set the terms for the final bilateral ceasefire process and subsequent demobilization of guerrillas.  Colombia aspired to bring good news that “the last armed conflict in the Western Hemisphere is coming to an end”. Colombia was not oblivious to the suffering of those who lived in places such as Syria  Iraq  Libya  the Sahel and Ukraine  and condemned the ruthless terrorism of ISIL  he said.  Nor was Colombia indifferent to the suffering of so many families in Palestine and Israel  or to the loss of life due to epidemics like Ebola in West Africa.  With the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations approaching  now was “a definitive moment” for the legitimacy of the Organization and its multilateral system.  The global community must dissuade those who promoted permanent war. In his own country and around the world  drug trafficking fuelled conflicts  he said.  The so-called “war on drugs” had scored some successes in the Western Hemisphere  he said  drawing attention to the resolution adopted last week at the special session of the Organization of American States’ General Assembly in Guatemala.  Those results would inform the special session on drugs that the United Nations had called for in 2016.  He was committed to making Colombia a country at total peace with equality and the highest rate of education in Latin America by 2025. HERY MARTIAL RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA RAKOTOARIMANANA  President of Madagascar  said that in choosing to restore constitutional order through the ballot box  the people of his country had confirmed their commitment to security and stability.  In so doing  they were building peace and security in the region and throughout the world.  Without peace  there could be no development  and without development  there could be no peace.  While his country had already achieved important milestones in development  it lacked the resources to tackle the magnitude of the tasks at hand. Five per cent of the world’s biodiversity was located in Madagascar  he said.  His country had sought to preserve that wealth and to ensure better management of it for future generations.  For example  Government authorities were working on a zero-tolerance policy on all kinds of trafficking of natural resources and wildlife.  Madagascar’s strategic location meant that it had to protect fishing areas and marine reserves.  Due to the increased potential for piracy  terrorism and trafficking  international cooperation was needed to protect such areas. Madagascar was also strengthening its legal arsenal by ratifying a number of multilateral agreements  such as the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol  on action to address climate change  he said.  As his country had experienced more than five years of political crises together with sanctions and all kinds of inhibitive measures  it was clear that it would not achieve most of the Millennium Development Goals.  Nevertheless  it had focused on the development of its people  in the areas of education  health care  jobs  security and access to information.  The stakes of climate change were enormous for Madagascar.  While resources to mitigate it fell short  his Government had nevertheless taken steps to reduce its impact by drafting a national policy for clean development and renewable energy. As a demonstration of Madagascar’s commitment to the United Nations beyond participation in its committees or conferences  he said that national police and penitentiary administration served in the Organization’s peacekeeping operations in Africa.  The Government had also sent 140 police officers to serve in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA).  It continued to advocate equitable representation in the Security Council so that countries directly involved in crises and conflicts could take part fully in the resolution process. IVO JOSIPOVIĆ  President of Croatia  said that faced with armed conflicts  natural disasters and pandemic diseases  the international community should look to the wise words of the United Nations Charter for guidance in how to deal with the varied threats  doing “everything we can” to avoid regression.  Croatia was deeply concerned with the situation in Ukraine.  Equally  the spread of terrorism in the Middle East and Africa  notably by the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq  was of grave concern.  Croatia was ready to make a contribution to Iraqi forces as well as for Iraqi Kurdish forces  he said. To be faced with such crises was “truly unnerving”  he said  noting that he hoped Croatia’s experience with peacebuilding would be applied in helping post-conflict societies stand on their own.  His Government expected a review of the peacebuilding architecture of the Organization to consolidate existing knowledge and experience and improve the overall peacebuilding process.  Women had a special role in maintaining peace and advancing development  and that was why Croatia was organizing a high-level meeting on 26 September on the gender dimension of sustainable development within the context of post-conflict recovery. On climate change  his Government was hopeful that a global agreement would be reached  as that pressing issue remained one of the “main pillars” of the post-2015 development agenda.  He expressed his Government’s support for the Organization’s human rights mechanisms  adding Croatia’s voice in calling for universal adherence to the Rome Statute and universal jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.  After reviewing national achievements in regional cooperation  he touched on the need for reform of the United Nations system  particularly Security Council enlargement by an additional non-permanent seat for the Eastern European group  as well as the establishment of a code of conduct regarding the suspension of veto use in cases relating to “mass crime”. On regional consolidation  he said his country looked forward to the day when all countries of South-East Europe would be admitted to the European Union.  Cooperating on such diverse issues as humanitarian assistance after devastating floods  or dealing with “truth and justice” in the context of a “difficult past”  countries of the region were finding numerous ways of laying a joint foundation for sustainable peace and stability.  The Secretary-General’s Global Education First Initiative was one of the best remedies for achieving such social improvement. HASSANAL BOLKIAH MU’IZZADDIN WADDAULAH  Sultan of Brunei Darussalam  said that 2014 marked the thirtieth anniversary of its membership to the United Nations.  On the Millennium Development Goals  his nation had contributed to training and capacity-building through measures of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  such as the “Initiative for ASEAN Integration” and an “English Enrichment Programme for ASEAN”.  On the post-2015 development agenda  he welcomed the future direction emphasizing the importance of human development  one which was inclusive  people-centred and sustainable.  Those elements were integral to Brunei Darussalam’s National Vision 2035. Citing unanimous conviction on the importance of protecting the environment  he welcomed the convening of the United Nations Climate Summit in galvanizing support to address the impact of climate change and ensuring a transformative post-2015 development agenda.  His Government was concerned with security developments in many parts of the world.  For its part  his nation had participated in United Nations peacekeeping  specifically the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and international peace monitoring missions in the southern Philippines. Global efforts in realizing the Millennium Goals would be in vain if  at the same time  the international community disregarded commitments to pursue the peaceful means of settling disputes as enshrined in the Organization’s Charter  he said.  Disaster management was among the matters of importance to his country.  In that context  in 2013 his nation had hosted a humanitarian and disaster relief exercise to train military personnel of big and small nations in the Asia-Pacific.  On Palestine  freedom and justice was long overdue  he said. ROBERT G. MUGABE  President of Zimbabwe  said that despite significant achievements made thus far with the Millennium Development Goals  progress among regions and within countries had been uneven.  He praised the proposed sustainable development goals for taking on the “unfinished business” of the Millennium Development Goals.  Part of that unfinished business was poverty eradication.  That issue should be a top priority of any future development agenda  which must be informed by national priorities.  To that end  his Government had adopted the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation to help expand the country’s industrial base  which had been a key component of sustained economic and human development. Because Zimbabwe had been preoccupied with the economic empowerment of its people  it had become a victim of the “evil machinations of Western countries”  he said.  Those States continued to apply sanctions as a foreign policy tool to achieve short-term political objectives  notably a regime change.  Zimbabweans should not continue to suffer due to “unjustified and illegal sanctions”  which violated the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter and should thus be condemned by the international community.  He called for their immediate and unconditional removal. He said that the African Union was working tirelessly to push for peace in conflict-ridden States in Africa  including the Democratic Republic of the Congo  South Sudan  Central Africa Republic and Somalia.  Still  the international community must remain engaged in the maintenance of peace and stability in Africa by enhancing its peacekeeping capacity through training  logistical and financial support.  In the Western Sahara  “the last colonial vestige” on the continent  the United Nations must ensure that its people achieved self-determination. The world had also witnessed the suffering and persecution of the people of Palestine at the hands of Israel  he said.  Despite “brutal and random” destruction of infrastructure in Gaza  the international community had maintained a “deafening silence”.  Lasting peace in the Middle East could only be achieved through a two-State solution  based on the 1967 borders.  Settlements or the use of force would only prolong the suffering of the Palestinians. OLLANTA HUMALA TASSO  President of Peru  said the sustainable development goals of the post-2015 development agenda deserved strong support and adequate and timely resources.  The adoption next year of the post-2015 development framework should lead to the establishment of a global partnership for sustainable development as well as participatory monitoring and accountability mechanisms to ensure appropriate follow-up.  There was a clear-cut link between Peru’s public policies on social inclusion and the goals agreed upon by the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. His Government had prioritized action to reduce all forms of poverty and inequality and eradicate extreme poverty and hunger  he said.  Similarly  it had focused on the fight for gender equality  empowerment of women  access to quality education and elimination of all forms of gender-based violence and violence against children.  State reforms were made to achieve those goals.  His Government had been working hard to lay the foundation for sustainable development.  Peru had become a clear example of how it was possible to achieve substantial progress in just a few years  having attained some of the Millennium Development Goals even before the 2015 deadline.  He was committed to reducing the poverty rate to 20 per cent by the end of his term in 2016. In only one generation  he said  Peru had made deep transformations thanks to peace and stability  the consolidation of democracy  opening the economy and the effectiveness of social-inclusion policies.  His Government had been increasing investment in social policies every year.  About half of the 12 per cent budget increase for 2015 went towards education and health.  He urged all stakeholders to participate actively in tackling the global drug problem  stressing the shared responsibility among countries that produced  consumed and financed the trade or served as a transit point.  They must help define a comprehensive strategy.  Peru’s relationships with its neighbours were excellent  he said  spotlighting a recent settlement of the maritime dispute with Chile.  The execution of the International Court of Justice’s ruling on that matter was the fastest in its history. Drawing attention to Peru’s hosting of the twentieth United Nations Climate Change Conference  or COP20  in Lima in December  he stressed the need for national commitments and for the formation of the largest alliance in history to address that transcendental challenge.  He urged Governments to send delegations with decision-making capability to the conference.  It was not just a matter of capitalizing the Green Climate Fund  but also of setting forth national commitments and having a binding agreement.  A 2011 study revealed that addressing the consequences of global warming was costing Peru 4 per cent of its annual gross domestic product (GDP).  That figure could reach more than 5 per cent by 2030 and 20 per cent in 2050 if no immediate action was taken to address the scourge. SHINZO ABE  Prime Minister of Japan  said his Government was putting forth its best efforts to fight Ebola.  In response to the outbreak  it had sent highly knowledgeable and experienced Japanese experts as members of World Health Organization missions.  Japan had also extended a total of $5 million in financial assistance and would provide personal protective equipment for health-care workers.  He pledged to extend an additional $40 million in the future. Speaking on the Middle East situation  he said that the region was in a state of unrest  with ISIL activities representing a serious threat to the international order.  He highlighted the importance of preventing extremism from taking root  while responding swiftly to the region’s humanitarian crises.  To assist in that regard  Japan would immediately provide $50 million in emergency assistance.  To contribute to Ukraine’s stability  Japan was providing economic assistance of up to $1.5 billion  while also preparing new assistance for the reconstruction of the eastern part of the country. He expressed Japan’s aspirations to join the Security Council as a non-permanent member at the election next year.  Since its accession to the United Nations in 1956  the country had worked tirelessly for the Organization’s causes.  With its seventieth anniversary looming  he sought resolution of the long-standing issue of reforming the United Nations to reflect the realities of the twenty-first century.  Turning to gender equality  he expressed his Government’s commitment to increasing women’s participation in society.  In less than a year  their empowerment had become a guiding principle  driving Japan’s policies  both domestically and overseas.  His Government had also focused on advancing the status of girls and mothers in Africa  a region which it prioritized in its foreign aid.  Japan intended to free the twenty-first-century world of human rights violations against women and was committed to eliminating sexual violence during conflicts. HAILEMARIAM DESSALEGN  Prime Minister of Ethiopia  said the current session was being held at an historic period characterized by a major undertaking to shape “the future we want”.  “If we did what we must  it could be remembered in history as a session that helped us turn the corner in ensuring effective custodianship of the environment  economic justice and social responsibility ” he said. Noting that last month marked 500 days until the target date of the Millennium Development Goals in 2015  he said Africa had registered robust economic growth over the last decade and that the stereotypical narrative about the continent was slowly changing.  “Africa is now the rising continent offering tremendous opportunities for trade and investment ” he said.  Notable progress had been made on the implementation of the Millennium Goals in the region.  However  much remained to be done  and thus it was important not to overlook the Millennium Goals as they remained “unfinished business”. Noting that Ethiopia would host the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa in July 2015  he said the effectiveness of the post-2015 agenda depended  among other things  on the success of the Conference.  On climate change  he stressed the need to reach a globally binding agreement by 2015 to limit the rise of global temperature.  Africa was facing the brunt of climate change and that was undermining its development aspirations  including the Millennium Goals.  Mitigation and adaptation remained a priority for the region  he said  calling for international support in that regard. “Conflict is not an exclusively African phenomenon ” he said  underscoring that the threat of terrorism had affected ever greater and wider areas of the world.  At no time over the last many decades had the need for effective international and regional cooperation been as pressing as it had been today.  The issue of “foreign fighters” had become a source of major concern to many.  The international community could not be oblivious to the nexus between the sustainable development agenda and the global situation of peace and security.  Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda required a peaceful and stable global environment.  In that vein  the spread of the Ebola virus was both a humanitarian and security challenge  and containing that disease should be a matter of utmost priority. MATTEO RENZI  Prime Minister of Italy  said he was honoured to address in the same Hall in which former United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld had spoken.  Citing present challenges  he said the future was no longer a dream  nor could the past be erased.  With that  he highlighted the Srebrenica massacre from 20 years ago.  The killings had found no justification  and he advocated for political effort as the way to prevent bloodshed.  Italy  due to its central location  had assumed a political role in the Mediterranean region  with strategic interventions  conducted with partners  saving 80 000 human lives. The situation in Libya  he said  was now a matter of concern  and the risk of it spiralling into violence should not be underestimated  as that could threaten the entire North African region.  Italy was committed to working with the United Nations Secretary-General to address the situation.  In the battle against the ISIL terrorist group in Iraq  the international community could not remain idle.  The fanatics had killed many  with children shot against the wall and young women raped in warehouses.  “Genocide is under way ” he warned  and only a united international effort could defeat it.  That was why Italy supported the call by United States President Barack Obama for a broader coalition. His country contributed troops to United Nations activities in Lebanon and Afghanistan and supported a two-State solution in the Israel-Palestinian conflict  he said  adding that the rights of Palestinians must be respected and Israel’s right to exist must not be questioned.  The situation in Ukraine jeopardized the process of European integration  and Italy supported the right of people there and the nation’s territorial integrity  which had been violated.  He urged the parties to seize the opportunity provided by the Minsk ceasefire. The Ebola outbreak had humanitarian and social impacts  he said  adding that his country was doing its part.  He also called for gender equality and non-discrimination based on religion  and advocated for a moratorium on capital punishment; a resolution to be tabled to that end would need broader support.  The Security Council should become more effective  but creation of more Council seats could compromise its effectiveness.  Finally  he warned  there would be no peace  no freedom and no respect without a huge investment in education. HERMAN VAN ROMPUY  President of the European Council  said that the abrupt and illegal annexation of Crimea in March had triggered the gravest threat to European security in decades.  The European Union stood firm in its solidarity with Ukraine and had responded to the aggression and violation of international law with political  economic and financial sanctions.  However  the sanctions were not a goal in themselves and could be revised  provided there was tangible progress.  The peace process launched in Minsk must be advanced  and all parties must respect the ceasefire and abide by the Peace Plan.  The Europeans were ready to engage with the Russian Federation and reestablish a basis of trust  he added. Highlighting situations in Iraq  Syria and the wider Middle East as the most pressing concern today  he welcomed the words and measures by the Arab League  the Organization of Islamic Cooperation  and Muslim nations against ISIL.  He urged the international community to do its part in confronting and isolating it by blocking financial and weapons flows  cutting off illegal oil revenue  and stopping the influx of foreign fighters.  Urgent collective action was needed to stop those combatants from joining ISIL’s ranks  as underlined in yesterday’s special Security Council session. The crisis  however  could not be resolved without a political solution for Syria  which he called one of the international community’s “biggest failures”.  There should be a comprehensive regional resolution  which must include a two-State solution.  The violent dynamics were spreading instability and fostering terrorism  organized crime  arms flows  drugs trafficking  human smuggling and radicalization.  Another tragic symptom of an imploding Middle East was dramatic migration in the Mediterranean  with millions fleeing the war in Syria into countries that included Jordan  Lebanon and Turkey.  European lifeguards  he noted  had rescued up to a thousand people a week — people risking their lives on small boats in search of a life free from fear. Reaffirming Europe’s commitment to fighting climate change  he expressed his hope for all nations  large and small  rich and poor  to assume their responsibility.  He called Ebola a plague of modern times  and the crisis caused by the outbreak a reminder that the future of a country and well-being of all depended on health-care structures.  Europe was there with others to help  to comfort  and to heal.  In closing  he said that fear must be overcome by fighting danger  restoring justice  and striving for peace so that next year when world leaders met again in New York  they could say that the spell of that dreadful summer of 2014 had been broken.  “Patiently but relentlessly we reconquer a place for hope ” he concluded. GASTON ALPHONSO BROWNE  Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Corporate Governance  Antigua and Barbuda  said it was disappointing that powerful States had circumvented the United Nations in pursuit of their national goals.  Antigua and Barbuda strongly supported the Organization’s reform  especially of the Security Council.  Today’s arrangement  where five permanent members were in possession of veto power  was “an anachronism”  which not only had no legitimacy  but also paralysed the Council from acting in certain cases.  It was paradoxical  he said  that those nations advocated respect for democracy and the rule of law  but declined to implement those ideals abroad. Small States like Antigua and Barbuda relied on the international rule of law to protect their rights  he said.  To that end  his country had 10 years ago brought a trade dispute with the United States to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Dispute Settlement Body.  Although the judgment had come down in favour of his country  the United States Government had not settled with Antigua and Barbuda  denying income to the country  which  had it been forthcoming  would have been used for climate change mitigation and to cope with the financial crisis.  It was crucial for democracy and the rule of law to be respected by the powerful as well as by the weak to avoid resentment and conflict. He urged the United States to end its “unjust” blockade of Cuba  and again spoke of the theme of powerful versus weak.  His country was small  with no military might or economic clout  he said  adding  “All that we have is membership of the international system as our shield  and our voice in this body as our sword.”  That was why reform of the United Nations system was so crucial.  Turning to the Millennium Development Goals  he noted that the developed world was not meeting the official development assistance targets  which led the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) region as a whole to turn to “non-traditional” sources of assistance  such as from China and Venezuela.  The global economic crisis was still having an impact on small States in the Caribbean  and it was urgent for the United Nations  through its appropriate organs  to address the debts those countries had accumulated as a result. Crisis was staring human civilization in the face  he said  whether it was through climate change  the Ebola virus  or the threat posed by the Islamic State  whose “savage and cruel” acts were deplorable.  The world could not afford to slip back into “the dark ages”  he said  stressing that the United Nations was critically needed at a time like this; it had no substitute anywhere in the world.  His country  for its part  was taking steps to build an all-inclusive  egalitarian society  working towards full gender equality and women’s advancement and empowerment. SHEIKH JABER AL-MUBARAK AL-HAMAD AL SABAH  Prime Minister of Kuwait  said that the United Nations’ current executive mechanisms and administrative structures impeded it from doing what was expected of it.  The United Nations organs  including the Security Council  and specialized agencies needed comprehensive reform.  Kuwait called for an enlargement of the Council by adding a permanent seat for Arab States.  In 1945  there had been only 5 Arab States  whereas today  there were 22  with a population of over 350 million people  he said. Turning to the situation in the Middle East  he said Israel had violated “the most basic rules of international law” during recent upheavals in Gaza.  He renewed his Government’s call for the Security Council to assume its responsibility by providing international protection to the Palestinian people and Territory  and to compel Israel  the occupying Power  to halt unilateral practices that aimed to impose a fait accompli through its illegal settlements and unlawful siege of Gaza.  He urged a return to negotiations leading to the establishment of a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital.  On the Syrian situation  he lamented the suffering of increasing numbers of people  and noted Kuwait’s contribution of $800 million in humanitarian support for people in need.  A political solution to the crisis was urgent. Tensions in Yemen resulting from “continued rivalry” between some factions were a source of concern  and as for the conditions in Libya  he said Kuwait renewed its support for the elected Government there.  Kuwait further supported ongoing international efforts to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue  adding  however  that they must guarantee the country’s right to peaceful use of nuclear energy  under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) supervision and monitoring.  His country denounced the actions of the “so-called” Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and its grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law  reiterating its support for the Iraqi Government to overcome terrorism. Praising the Millennium Development Goals for their “outstanding role” in improving the lives of millions  he said he looked forward to a “comprehensive and ambitious” post-2015 development plan.  On that note  the Secretary-General’s Climate Change Summit this week was commendable  as that issue affected the world in general and the Arab world in particular.  Humanitarian help to the needy was at the basis of Kuwait’s foreign policy  he said  noting the doubling of his country’s fixed annual voluntary contributions to a number of international agencies and organizations  including the WHO  in response to the Ebola crisis. VICTOR-VIOREL PONTA  Prime Minister of Romania  said the current situation in Ukraine was of the utmost concern for his country due to its security impacts on Eastern European countries.  The unilateral annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation  an unprecedented action on the European continent in decades  had been followed by an internal conflict in eastern Ukraine  which was generated by forces pursuing separatist goals  financed and supplied by the Russian Federation.  His Government rejected any form of external pressure towards Eastern European States aspiring for a European integration  and it supported Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Located at the crossroads of the Danube and Black Sea regions  as well as that of Northern Europe and the Balkans  Romania  he said  fully understood that regional cooperation was a key to stability there.  Joint initiatives on the economy  environment  infrastructure and cross-border cooperation  including through the European Union Strategy for the Danube River and the European Union Black Sea Synergy  had a long-term impact on all countries in the region.  He praised the solidarity expressed by the Union and its transatlantic partners in supporting the European aspirations sought by the Republic of Moldova  Ukraine and Georgia. The proliferation of radical Islamist movements and the emergence of new groups  such as ISIL  had heightened the terrorist threat  he said.  The group went beyond Iraq and Syria  and therefore represented a major challenge to the global order; it must be addressed by all States.  On development  the future agenda should address poverty eradication and sustainable development  good governance and the rule of law  and it should provide a platform for social inclusion and reduced unemployment. On refugees  he said that the emergency transit centre in Timisoara  Romania  established by his Government  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  and the International Organization for Migration  was the first of its kind in the world and had proved to be a feasible mechanism  offering safety to persons in urgent need of international protection.  It  thus  was a practical expression of the human security concept. TONY ABBOTT  Prime Minister of Australia  said that while the United Nations was an “imperfect instrument”  like any institution  his country had always believed in the Organization’s potential and supported its work.  He highlighted that Australia — a relatively small country — had provided more than 65 000 personnel to more than 50 multilateral peace and security operations since the United Nations’ establishment.  “We have never shrunk from shouldering our responsibilities ” he added. As a good global citizen  his country had pledged $8 million towards combating the Ebola outbreak and contributed health professionals to work with international agencies in the region  he said.  It had sponsored a Security Council resolution to investigate the Malaysian flight MH17 crash site and return home those who perished.  Australia would do everything to ensure that the investigation was not undermined and that the crime was not covered up.  On another matter of importance to his country  he said that  at the request of the Iraqi Government  an Australian force had been deployed to the Middle East to join the coalition to degrade the ISIL terrorist movement. To build a better world  it was crucial to create stronger and more resilient people and communities  he said.  While a robust economy would not solve every problem  it would make most of them easier to tackle.  As this year’s Chair of the Group of 20 (G20)  Australia was determined to promote private-sector led growth  since profitable  private businesses were the “best source of real  sustainable  wealth”.  Free trade  infrastructure  a modern international tax system  strong global economic institutions and a resilient financial sector were all part of the G20 agenda.  “When wealth increases  countries grow stronger ” he said.  The goal was to boost output by an extra 2 per cent over the next five years to create millions of jobs and trillions in wealth around the world. Likewise  the post-2015 development agenda should also focus on economic growth as it eased social challenges and that of climate change  among others.  To those who doubted that stronger economic growth could be achieved  he pointed to the rise of Asia  which  in less than two generations  had been able to undertake the greatest social and economic transformation in history. AL HADJI YAHYA A.J.J. JAMMEH  President of Gambia  said that human civilization was teetering on the brink of catastrophe.  Greed and exclusion led to international tensions  war  death and destruction.  There were lamentable inactions on the part of the United Nations as powerful Member States took advantage of weaker Members.  The founding fathers of the Organization had intended a world body committed to promoting the principles of peace and security  respectful of the cultural values of all peoples.  To uphold those principles  the Member States needed to avoid all forms of aggression by exercising maximum restraint in their pursuit of national interests.  When there were wars  the world economy suffered.  The United Nations must be an all-encompassing global body working in the service of all  and not just for a few. He said the international community should build from the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals to face the challenges of the day.  The themes of this year’s General Assembly were thus timely  and gave impetus to further the international agenda post-2015.  There was a need to take stock of the Millennium Development Goals’ achievements and failures  particularly struggling countries that would not meet their targets on time. A few current issues stood out for which the United Nations could play a stronger role  he said.  One such issue was the Ebola disease.  For those affected countries  development efforts were now on hold as they grappled with the virus.  Humanitarian aid from the United States to battle Ebola was more than just a humanitarian gesture; it was a matter of national security. The world had witnessed the bloodiest and most heinous forms of terrorism  he said.  Those “human vermin” were claiming to act in the name of Islam.  Before the emergence of Mujahideen in Iran and then Afghanistan in the 1980s  which were created by Western Powers to fight proxy battles  there had been no Islamic terrorism.  Islam was a religion of peace and tolerance  and had nothing to do with those bands of criminals who showed no respect for human life and whose sole intention was to defame Islam.  That religion could not be divided into different branches  such as moderate Islam  violent Islam  and so on.  Rather  it was a pure religion for the best human behaviour  as decreed by Allah the Creator.  Such gangsters as Boko Haram  ISIL and Al-Qaida needed to be wiped out from the face of the Earth “because we don’t need them”. The situation in the Middle East remained dire  he said  decrying the loss of life in Palestine  especially that of women and children.  Israeli settlements on Palestinian land were unacceptable and undermined any prospect for a two-State solution.  The United Nations had played a strategic mediating role in the past  and must take up a leading role to achieve a durable and peaceful settlement.  The Organization must work harder to foster an environment of peace and tolerance  as there was a grim propagation of misinformation and misinterpretation in the Western media regarding Islam and Sharia law.  Thus the incessant criticism of Sharia law was disrespectful and abhorrent  and was disgraceful to all Muslims. He said that imposing collective punishment on Cuba was done because its citizens had opted for a system of government of their choice  just as Ukraine wished to do.  On climate change  Africa stood to suffer the most  despite the fact that the continent was not a big contributor to the problem.  Developing countries must not be relegated to the dustbin of history.  Rather  the foundation of any transformative agenda should begin with the reform of global governance  particularly the United Nations system  including the Security Council.  Reform of that body  to reflect current geopolitical realities  was long overdue. BRONISŁAW KOMOROWSKI  President of Poland  pointed to the toll endured by his country from the two World Wars  out of which the United Nations was born.  He described the failure of the League of Nations to respond to totalitarian expansionism  appeasing dictators at the expense of weaker States.  The Second World War was the price paid for those acts of negligence.  International security had been rebuilt after that war and the world was now looking forward to the United Nations seventieth anniversary.  The Organization had many “beautiful achievements”  but also numerous failures.  The current situation was particularly worrisome because it displayed many symptoms of the phenomena that had caused the fall of the League.  Super-Powers were back in vogue  as were geopolitical zones of influence.  The United Nations should not tolerate any departure from the Charter-based security and international relations principles. The occupation of Crimea and aggression in Ukraine was a violation of international law standards and “ran roughshod over the United Nations fundamental values”  he said.  The conflict’s ideological backdrop was a return to the rhetoric of the first half of the twentieth century  and imperial domination of weaker nations that were obliged to act as obedient satellites to a Power “performing a revision of the foundations of the civilized order”.  The Security Council was ineffective in protecting peace in Ukraine and elsewhere  partly due to its rules.  Those needed amending  he said  welcoming at the same time General Assembly resolution 68/262 of March 2014  which had taken the side of the weaker party in an act of imperial aggression. It particularly concerned him to be describing that situation  given that it was the twenty-fifth anniversary of the abolition of communism and the collapse of the Soviet bloc.  Those changes meant freedom  respect for human rights  good governance and an end to the world’s bipolar division.  The changes had begun in Poland with establishment of the Solidarity Movement.  The new logic of international relations had brought unification and integration to Europe  and the European Union had become a “guarantor of peace in Europe and far beyond its borders”.  The end of divisions gave rise to hope for democracy  peace and prosperity  “free from external domination”.  He hoped for a democratic modernization of Russia  too.  However  what had happened in East Europe six months ago “dealt a blow to that hope and threatened security on our continent”. Wars and conflicts were continuing elsewhere  too  he said  with the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant’s brutal murders and terror.  The international community must respond in line with its obligation to protect those threatened by cruel violence.  Conflicts in Syria  Libya  Israel  Gaza and in African States were also painful  he said  urging the super-Powers at the United Nations to influence the parties towards resolution of the issues.  He paid tribute to the Organization and its agencies in aiding refugees and said many humanitarian dramas were caused by a breakdown of fundamental human rights.  Power without control was generally “corrupt  self-loving  incapable of lifting countries out of underdevelopment and poverty”.  That  he asserted  was the background to many conflicts.  More development assistance was needed to help transformations. He stressed the role of democracy  citing the Community of Democracies established in Warsaw in 2000 and the Lech Wałęsa Solidarity Award as examples of his country’s commitment.  The rule of law and universal fundamental rights were vital to development and should be included in the post-2015 agenda.  The new development blueprint should integrate all elements of sustainable development and achieve international agreement.  Climate change must also be tackled  and he remained committed to achieving the successful conclusion of negotiations on a climate change convention.  Noting the extra responsibility his country was taking in several fields  he looked forward to non-permanent Security Council membership in 2018-2019.  He would support the body’s reform to increase its representation and efficiency  and enable it to fulfil its responsibility to protect. ANDRIS BĒRZIŅŠ  President of Latvia  said that global security and peace was being challenged by forces willing to “rewrite the history and rules of the international order”.  The Russian aggression against Ukraine had defied the basic principles of the United Nations  uprooting the foundation of the international system.  Those actions could only be defined as a threat to global peace and security and  as such  the illegal annexation of Crimea by that country should not be recognized and must be condemned.  The Russian Federation had a vital role to play in security and stability in Europe and thus should be “part of the solution  not part of the problem”  he said  calling on that country to respect its international commitments and uphold international law.  A resolution was also needed to the protracted conflicts in Transnistria  Abkhazia  South Ossetia and Nagorno-Karabahkh  he said. On the Syrian situation  he said that while the easing of human suffering should be the immediate priority  the international community must continue political efforts to find a solution to that conflict.  Those responsible for war crimes against humanity in Syria must be held accountable by the International Criminal Court.  The limited ability of the Security Council to address the urgent situations in Ukraine and Syria had highlighted the need to move forward with Council reform.  Towards that end  Latvia supported the Council’s expansion in both categories of membership.  It also believed the French initiative aimed at restricting the use of the veto warranted attention. In other matters of international security  he welcomed the ongoing dialogue between the E3+3 countries and Iran  which aimed to negotiate a comprehensive agreement on the country’s nuclear programme.  “We must work towards revitalizing the global disarmament and non-proliferation agenda ” he said.  With that in mind  the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference next year depended on trust and common purpose.  Latvia was one of the first States to have signed and ratified the Arms Trade Treaty  and it urged all Member States to do the same. Without peaceful societies  it was not possible to achieve sustainable development  he said  adding that each country had a responsibility in that regard.  The post-2015 agenda must be consistent with all human rights and be underpinned by the rule of law.  It should address inequalities and discrimination  including through information and communication technologies  as those could be key enablers of development.  Gender equality was essential in shaping respectful and equal relationships in society  and those values were important to Latvia.  As an aspiring member of the Human Rights Council for 2015‑2017  his country would continue to promote those important values globally. ALI BONGO ONDIMBA  President of Gabon  said the current session was being held in a time of threats  including those posed by Boko Haram  which sowed desolation and indiscriminate killing.  Further  Ebola was plunging Africa into mourning.  He paid tribute to the men and women risking their lives  and in some cases giving them in that fight  and he welcomed efforts by the United Nations and Member States.  Gabon had prevailed against Ebola in the past  he noted  voicing its intention to contribute to the new mission. Concerning a post-2015 development agenda  he said African priorities  including extreme poverty eradication  agriculture  protection of the environment and other important issues  enjoyed pride of place.  A bold development programme was needed  which covered the ideals of the Millennium Development Goals  and also addressed climate change.  Gabon wished to move to an economy of industry and services  and it wished to improve the yield of its educational system.  It was best to anticipate the leap into the post-2015 development agenda  and such aims were a step in that direction.  To lay solid foundations for the agenda  it was necessary to tailor a country’s economic situation. Gabon’s commitment to combating climate change remained consistent  he said  recalling the latest report of the International Press Telecommunications Council  which was a reminder of the painful reality of climate change.  It was wrong to remain insensitive  he said  adding that Gabon would bear its share of the common responsibility.  In that context  it planned to halve its carbon emissions.  A “South Climate Initiative”  set to follow the Lima conference  would address the climactic upheaval  which was a vital and even an existential issue.  There must be a shared objective  aimed at saving the planet  which should be the focus of the Paris conference in December 2015. He welcomed the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas  and hoped for the creation of a viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace with Israel.  He reiterated support for the Moroccan initiative  which was likely to lead to a lasting settlement.  Further  he favoured lifting the embargo on Cuba. On other matters of concern  he said the terrorist threat was greater than ever.  Boko Haram caused entire populations to seek shelter far from their homes  in fear  precariousness and despair.  No nation was spared the murderous folly of those negative entities  and thus combating it must be more concerted and coordinated.  He called for strengthening the United Nations operational capacities in support of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.  Finally  he expressed support for the London Initiative of February 2014  opposing poaching and the ivory trade.  Respect for human dignity was at the core of Gabon’s concerns  which was why chairing the Human Rights Council was so important. JUAN CARLOS VARELA RODRÍGUEZ  President of Panama  said that despite the serious conflicts taking place around the world  the American continent was at peace.  The most serious challenges before it were: inequality; the fight against organized crime and drug and human trafficking; and regulation of migration flows to more developed economies.  While Governments in the region were addressing those challenges  they required further coordination. Noting that countries had reached consensus 14 years ago when they adopted the Millennium Declaration  he said that certain Millennium Development Goals remained challenges and that new challenges had arisen.  Therefore a new consensus must be built at the regional  hemispheric and global levels.  As a Government that promoted consensus among the international community  Panama was committed to facilitating dialogue towards that end. Marking the centennial of the Panama Canal  he said that the Isthmus of Panama had been the transit route of civilizations for five centuries  and reiterated a commitment to being a nation at the service of the international community.  The expansion of the Canal would be completed with the support of professionals and workers from Panama and other nations.  He noted further the importance of mediating disputes that prevented consensus and said  as host of the Summit of the Americas in 2015  the country was working to promote integration and social peace with equity and prosperity. He stressed the need for elected officials to serve the people who had put them in office  calling politics “one of the strongest expressions of social service [as] the search for the common good”.  In that context  he expressed his commitment to a Government that would foster the economic growth enjoyed by Panama  while giving priority to public investment that impacted the life of all Panamanians.  With average domestic growth of 7 per cent  increasing foreign investment and a consolidated democratic system  the Government was making progress on the proposals that had won him the election. Among its achievements were measures to curb speculation in the cost of food; the provision of adequate housing with appropriate water and sanitation; and major projects for youth  education  the elderly  public health and transportation  he continued.  In closing  he stressed Panama’s role as a bridge to attain understanding  stating  “We live in a diverse world with different cultures  religions and political systems  but we can always find common ground in the well-being of our citizens.”  That had been the formula for approval of the Millennium Development Goals  and would be key to fulfilling the post-2015 development agenda. JOSEPH KABILA KABANGE  President  Democratic Republic of the Congo  said terrorism continued to claim the lives of people around the world  and Africa  formerly saved from its blind violence  was today its epicentre.  African nations  including Somalia  Libya  Nigeria and Kenya  among others around the world  were afflicted by that blight  which there was a moral obligation to eliminate.  African countries also saw their paths to development blocked by the recent Ebola outbreak  which had claimed the lives of more than 2 000 people  including 40 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Africa’s struggle against the disease was heroic  but States there needed support.  The entire human race was threatened by the disease and the international community’s “touching and effective” solidarity with Africa was a “beautiful example of human solidarity”  as compared to the “naked competition” seen in many other areas.  The outbreak was the seventh to strike his country  and he offered the benefits of 30 years of experience of Congolese health professionals to West African countries in need of it. Wars were engulfing the Middle East  Ukraine  Syria  Libya and the Central African Republic  he said  recalling the aim of the United Nations to handle situations that were causing death and devastation.  He wondered why  so many decades after its establishment  the human race still seemed unable to preserve peace.  He promised Congolese help in preventing wars  noting that a Congolese contingent of peacekeepers was active in the Central African Republic.  Any impediments to implementing the post-2015 development agenda could be handled as long as there was political will and resolve to do so. He looked back 13 years  when the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo had been bad  but added that things had improved significantly and the country was now standing tall again.  Peace was strengthening every day and the country had a dynamic economy  marked by low inflation  growth above the African average and constantly increasing reserves.  The country was being rebuilt at an unprecedented rate  with new roads  schools  and hospitals always under construction.  The Government’s priorities were strengthening democracy and national cohesion  and success was apparent.  Elections would be held under the auspices of an independent electoral commission and everything had been done to ensure that the country emerged from the balloting more at peace with itself and stronger.  Efforts would continue to re-establish peace in the country’s East and to improve relations with neighbours  he said  pointing to an improved business climate and stressing the importance of stability to achieving that. With six of the world’s most dynamic economies in Africa and their rapidly growing populations and vast natural resources  he said it was “not normal” that the continent did not have a permanent seat on the Security Council.  It was high time that situation changed  he said  adding that such reforms were also essential prerequisites for improving that body’s effectiveness. ROSSEN PLEVNELIEV  President of Bulgaria  cited the unprecedented floods that recently swept his country as an example of why climate change must be urgently addressed.  For its part  Bulgaria would actively support forthcoming negotiations aimed at reaching a legally binding climate agreement in 2015. As we enter the critical phase of the post-2015 development debate  it was crucial that all sides remain committed to an “ambitious and forward-looking framework”  he said.  A transformative agenda would only be possible if we address the loopholes of the current Millennium Development Goals and build upon lessons learned.  The new goals should be founded on the principles of respect for human rights  good governance and the rule of law.  Youth-related targets on education  health and employment were also important. Development was unthinkable without peace and security  he said.  The illegal annexation of Crimea undermined international order and was one of the most serious threats to peace and security in Europe since the Second World War.  The principles embodied in the Charter had been “shattered to pieces in a matter of weeks”  he said.  Bulgaria considered the annexation a violation of international law and voted in favour of General Assembly resolution 68/262 to support the territorial integrity of Ukraine.  Despite that  he welcomed the recent ceasefire agreement and expressed hope that forthcoming elections would provide the foundation for a democratic and prosperous Ukraine. Human rights  democracy and the rule of law were at the heart of Bulgaria’s foreign policy agenda  he said.  That commitment was further strengthened by his country’s chairmanship of the Social  Humanitarian and Cultural Committee (Third Committee) during the sixty-eighth session of the Assembly.  His country would continue to promote human rights internationally and support the Secretary-General’s Human Rights Up Front initiative.  As a country that saved 48 000 Jews during the Second World War  Bulgaria was particularly concerned about recent anti-Semitic attacks taking place around the world  including in Europe  and condemned that recurring trend. BUJAR NISHANI  President of Albania  said that peace  security and human values continued to be challenged in 2014.  In that context  he turned to events in South Sudan  stating that trust could be built only through a political  negotiated solution  where the rights of all communities were taken into account.  Albania  along with some 60 other Member States  had sought to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court  but that initiative had been vetoed in the Security Council  as had many others on the matter.  He emphasized that the perpetrators of atrocities in Syria must be held accountable.  The people of Syria deserved relief and justice. Expressing concern at events in Ukraine  he said that a Permanent Member of the Security Council  the Russian Federation  had violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of another country  thus undermining the Charter.  Although the Council had been unable to take action on the issue  the Assembly had voted overwhelmingly not to accept the annexation of Crimea and to support Ukraine’s territorial integrity.  The crises and disasters erupting around the world were also putting pressure on development.  There had nevertheless been successes towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals  and Albania had been an active participant in formulating the post-2015 development agenda  agreeing to test a proposed goal on governance and rule of law.  The transformative and inclusive sustainable development goals outlined in Rio in 2012 and the open-ended working group on sustainable development had produced a remarkable proposal on which to build.  He also applauded the finalization of standard operating procedures for Delivering as One and its action plan to simplify and harmonize them. Terrorism was another high priority  which could only be met through collective action and a powerful response  he continued.  Condemning all terrorist acts committed in Iraq and Syria  he reported that Albania had joined the global coalition to defeat ISIS.  Noting that his own region was of geostrategic importance for Europe  he said Albania’s designation as European Union candidate would encourage intensification of domestic reforms.  He also expressed support for the overall development of Kosovo  the region’s youngest State  and for its territorial integrity in its current borders.  Dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia was facilitating European Union integration for both  he said  calling on all countries that had not yet done so to recognize Kosovo. Turning to progress in his own country  he said that over the last two decades Albania had transformed from a totalitarian State to a functioning democracy  with progress most evident in the area of human rights.  The country offered a valuable model of respect for diversity  tolerance and coexistence for the Balkan region and beyond.  Its candidacy for the Human Rights Council  2015-2017  was a logical consequence of the road it had taken to build a rights-based society  and membership would serve as impetus to further democratization. JÁNOS ÁDER  President of Hungary  said  “If you want peace  you must prepare for war.”  He was not speaking about preparing for military conflict but about the war being waged on the natural environment.  The Secretary-General had described how dire the situation was at the recent Climate Summit and the General Assembly had heard many dramatic figures.  Awareness of a climate change problem went back to 1896  when a Swedish scientist had noticed that increases in CO2 levels would lead to increased temperatures.  Those changes were measured 60 years later  and 30 years after that  there was realization that a treaty would be needed to respond.  Kyoto had come a decade later  meaning it had taken a century between identifying the problem and beginning to respond to it.  Since Kyoto  there had been conferences  scientific meetings and political get-togethers  but despite promises  the situation continued to worsen. Mother Nature continually gave warnings with its climate events  he said  pointing to floods  typhoons and other adverse meteorological events.  There were unprecedented freezing temperatures recorded in Uttar Pradesh in India during January  temperatures of 31 degrees Celsius in Lapland in May  a white Christmas in Bethlehem and 123 temperature records in Australia over a year.  In Europe  the River Danube drew attention — before the Second World War  it had flooded many times but never had reached 8 metres.  In the past four years  it had passed 8 metres four times  coming close to 9 metres in 2013.  In New York  Hurricane Sandy had caused $20 billion of damage and killed more than 40 people  despite consistent warnings by the New York administration that they needed to spend money to prepare.  That was why the Mayor of New York had announced his wish to reduce the city’s carbon emissions by 80 per cent in the next 30 years. He recognized the work done by the Secretary-General in preparation for an agreement between States at the Paris summit in 2015.  The question was whether Member States were doing enough to prepare for the summit.  Having heard speeches made over the course of the week  he was not optimistic.  He pointed to political narrow-mindedness and asked why the wisdom of scientists and the planet’s signals were being ignored.  There was a good example of action that should instruct the international community  which came from the response to chlorofluorocarbon  or CFC  gasses.  Having been introduced in the 1950s  30 years of use had led to a 40 per cent reduction in the ozone layer.  That had caused medical consequences in the form of increased prevalence of dermatological tumours.  A deal had been struck in Montreal in 1987 to ban the gasses  and the first report had recently been released  which pointed to regeneration of the ozone layer. It was not possible to wait for an agreement on climate change and hope that would arrest and even reverse the problem  he said.  It was vital to reach agreement in Paris  but climate change was a much larger problem.  Nevertheless  the target States were hoping to agree to restrict temperature rises to just 2 degrees Celsius  but that already seemed to be an illusion.  The concentration of CO2 had never been higher  and scientists were saying that an accord today would not prevent effects in the future.  The world must come to terms with the idea that the next generation would have to live with the expensive price of past irresponsible environmental policies  and it had to prepare for more serious natural events and disasters.  Nicholas Stern had called for an investment of 1 per cent gross domestic product (GDP) on prevention to avoid environmental damage of up to 20 per cent of GDP.  Paraphrasing the Roman military author  Vegetius  he concluded:  “If you want calm  you must prepare for disasters. ARTHUR PETER MUTHARIKA  President of Malawi  said that in May  the country had held its first ever tripartite elections  which had enabled Malawians to choose their political leadership through a democratic and peaceful process.  Despite a few challenges  the elections had been free  fair  transparent and credible.  In July  Malawi had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of its independence.  Although it had made some strides in the diverse sectors of national development  more must be done to improve the living standards of many Malawians  who remained below the poverty line. He said his country had always rendered political support for the disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction.  He was disheartened by the continuing violence and loss of life and property in the Middle East  owing to the conflict between Israel and Palestine  and believed that the two-State solution was the only viable path to lasting peace in the region.  He encouraged both sides to denounce violence  exercise utmost restraint  and employ dialogue to reach a political settlement. Turning to the post-2015 development agenda  he was pleased that Malawi had been among those selected for national consultations.  His country was on track to achieving just four of the eight Millennium Development Goals and thus would proceed to the post-2015 era with unfinished business.  Inadequate resources were among the reasons for its failure to have achieved all the Goals.  Development partners’ commitments had been unpredictable and at times unfulfilled.  He added that the post-2015 development agenda should allow for some flexibility in implementation and should focus on the plight of disadvantaged groups  such as women  girls and persons with disabilities. Regarding Security Council reform  he expressed his concern about its limited representation and said that only by expanding the number of its permanent and non-permanent members and including developing countries in both categories would its “legitimacy deficits” be solved. BARON WAQA  President of Nauru  said that meeting today’s challenges required recognition that “we live in an interconnected world and the actions of one country or region impact the lives of people half a world away”.  Reckless actions by nations had severely undermined the marine environment on which small island developing States depended — for their culture  economy and food.  At the same time  some of the countries responsible for the damage were also charged with assessing the well-being of that environment. “How can we be confident that our interests will be protected?” he asked  when those who downplayed and sometimes covered up their own transgressions demanded greater transparency and accountability from developing countries. He said that finding lasting solutions to such problems required examination of failures in the global order  which prevented countries like Nauru from accessing fair economic benefits from their own resources.  Unable to stand by while others decided what was best for them  parties to the Nauru Agreement were taking the lead in managing their tuna stocks through such measures as curbing illegal fishing and sustainable harvesting.  The current approach to problems  where a donor’s political interests determined aid priorities  failed to address the underlying “disease”.  What was needed was long-term in-country engagement backed by real resources that left behind durable nationally owned domestic institutions. Commending announcements made by world leaders at the Climate Summit on planned actions by their countries and corporations  he nevertheless believed that many of those actions would occur under some future government and decade.  At the same time  small island developing States  who contributed only a fraction of global emissions  had undertaken to build sustainable economies and some of the most ambitious pledges to cut emissions.  Nauru  for example  was working to achieve a 50 per cent reduction by 2020.  In addition  the Pacific small island developing States had led the Assembly to formally recognize the connection between climate change and international peace and security in 2009  and the Security Council to do so in 2011. In that context  he said that the Secretary-General should appoint a special representative on climate and security  and he should lead a joint task force of all relevant United Nations bodies to assess the Organization’s capacity to respond.  The Security Council must also reflect new geopolitical realities by becoming more representative and inclusive.  New members must be more geographically diverse and willing to broaden their vision beyond a narrow focus on domestic interests  for the good of all Member States. TOMMY ESANG REMENGESAU  JR.  President of Palau  said that his country  the Pacific region and the world had reached a crossroads.  In the International Year of Small Island Developing States  communities  societies  cultures and economies around the world were under attack as never before experienced on many fronts.  “We can continue business as usual ” he said  “or we can choose a different road  one that will enable our critical habitats a chance to recover and […] ensure their continued ability to sustain us.”  The Pacific region  whose people comprehended first-hand the real and present impacts of climate change  would not go down without a fight  he declared. He recalled agreement by leaders at the Pacific Islands Forum that they must play a central role in the stewardship of the Pacific Ocean.  Among the efforts under way were the establishment of protected marine areas and work to launch negotiations by September 2015 for an international agreement under the Convention on the Law of the Sea for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.  He called on the United Nations to ensure a stand-alone sustainable development goal on oceans  and in that context  he warned against making the new goals too broad.  Targets must be realistic  simple  transparent and measurable  and focus on countries whose people were most in need.  Indeed  the time had come to complete the job on the Millennium Development Goals  improving the level and responsiveness of financing mechanisms and ensuring that they reached those who needed it. Climate change was the planet’s silent war  he went on  adding that a temperature increase of 3.6˚C was simply unacceptable.  If that is the best that global leaders could do  “we might as well throw in the towel and stop having children  because there will be no future for them”  he said.  By the end of 2015  world leaders must announce new  realistic commitments and practical actions supported by enhanced financial commitment to both mitigation and adaptation  and ratification of the second amendment to the Kyoto Protocol.  Migration should not feature as an option in discussions  he said.  Quoting a speaker from the Marshall Islands at the Climate Change Summit  he said  “no one is moving  no one is losing their homeland  no one is becoming a climate refugee”. Palau had committed to a 20 per cent contribution of renewable energy to the energy mix and a 30 per cent reduction in energy consumption by 2020.  Stressing the importance of global partnerships in the fight against climate change  he expressed gratitude to those who had assisted Palau.  In closing  he said:  “Without effective partnerships  change will simply not occur.  And without legally binding commitments towards our oceans and towards climate change  we will not make the transformative changes that we need to make in the next generation.” JAKAYA MRISHO  President of the United Republic of Tanzania  said the unmet targets of the Millennium Development Goals should be factored into the post-2015 development agenda  while implementation of existing goals had to be sped up in the remaining days.  Financing the next agenda needed special attention.  Experience had taught that targets would be missed because of “unpredictable  unreliable  insufficient and untimely availability of resources”.  A mechanism to ensure stable  predictable and reliable financing for implementation was vital.  Next year was also the one in which a legally binding climate change agreement must be concluded.  The Climate Change Summit had offered a unique opportunity to deliberate on ways to save the planet from disaster  and he hoped it would lay the groundwork for the Lima Conference.  “Failure is not an option ” he declared. He called for reform of the United Nations  noting reports that negotiations and consultations were not showing encouraging signs.  Expressing frustration on that front  he said momentum must be maintained and he called on the General Assembly President to use his good offices and diplomatic skills to revitalize the process.  There were several global threats to peace and security  including terrorism  illicit exploitation of natural resources  poaching  and the illicit trade in narcotic drugs and arms.  Concerning terrorism  many lives had been lost and people had been abducted or forced to flee.  It was imperative for all countries to play an active role in defeating Al-Shabaab  Boko Haram  ISIS and other terrorist groups.  The situations in Libya  Central African Republic and South Sudan also must be addressed. Turning to the recent hostilities between Israel and Palestine  he said there had been “horrifying scenes of bombing and death of innocent women and children”.  Concerted efforts were needed now to ensure that the solution — two States living side by side harmoniously — was reached.  He reiterated his previous appeal concerning Western Sahara  urging resolution of the problem “once and for all”.  He could not comprehend how it remained unresolved  especially when compared to the situation in East Timor  which had emerged at around the same time  but had been addressed.  With that  he called on the United Nations to “put the Sahrawi question to rest”.  He also called for an end to sanctions and the embargo against Cuba  saying those guaranteed perpetual hardship and poverty. Turning to the Ebola epidemic  he noted that 2 400 people had died  with no cure or vaccine.  The virus presented a major threat to neighbouring countries and beyond  and without success in controlling it  there was every danger it could become a global epidemic.  Collective efforts were needed  he said  insisting that the world had the technology  knowledge and financial resources to find a cure or a vaccine.  He applauded the efforts of the United Nations  WHO  United States and others  and requested continued and bolstered support to control the disease  particularly assistance to other West African nations to build capacity for surveillance  isolation and treatment.  Noting the stigma developing against the continent  he said tourism was crucial and must be protected. STEPHEN HARPER  Prime Minister of Canada  said that his country had a strong record in serving humanity and upholding United Nations values  and on many occasions  Canadians had put their lives on the line for that purpose.  Today’s crises illustrated the role of poverty and injustice in war  but those were not the only causes.  There were affronts to human dignity and the international order  and Canada had always been ready and willing to partner with other civilized countries in combating them.  It would continue to assist its allies in the international community to deal with today’s grave challenges. He said that any effort was in vain  however  if people were not provided with alternatives to a better way of life.  Trade and the effective delivery of aid had become the signature of Canada’s outreach to the world.  His country was proof of how trade had made “great nations out of small ones” and created new opportunities for ordinary people and their families.  The trade agreements reached by his country had helped to establish important links to world commerce.  While assistance to vulnerable countries was necessary for development  investment was needed even more to achieve sustainable growth. Saving the lives of vulnerable mothers around the world should be another top priority  he said.  Despite remarkable progress in recent years  thanks to vaccines and other simple techniques  millions of mothers and children who would have died in the past now had a chance to survive.  He praised the Secretary-General’s Every Woman  Every Child initiative as it provided a clear path forward to prevent the deaths of children from easily avoidable causes.  New levels of excellence were achieved via partnerships that brought Governments together with the private sector.  With renewed political focus and financial commitment  saving the lives of children and mothers “is a fight we can win”  he stated.  Looking beyond the post-2015 development agenda  maternal  newborn and child health must once again become a top priority.  Canada was proud to financially support the Every Woman  Every Child initiative and invited other countries to do the same. MARK RUTTE  Prime Minister and Minister for General Affairs of the Netherlands  said that in a summer already marked by alarming reports from Syria  Iraq and Gaza  his country was confronted with a stark international reality.  The 298 passengers of flight MH17 would be alive today if not for the Crimea conflict and the destabilization of eastern Ukraine.  Of the victims  196 were Dutch nationals.  That tragedy had an immense impact on the country.  Entire families were ripped from neighbourhoods  desks were left empty in offices and schools  team-mates were gone forever.  The pain would be felt for years to come.  Some of the victims still had not been identified  and that must be done as soon as possible.  Nothing was more important to their loved ones  wherever they might be in the world. This past summer  the world was reminded how interwoven world events could be at home and abroad  he said.  When it came to addressing the problems facing the global community  there was simply no alternative to working together.  He was grateful for Security Council resolution 2166 (2014).  The cause of the MH17 disaster must be brought to light  those responsible must be brought to justice and all remains and personal belongings needed to be repatriated.  Access to the crash site must be granted.  The events of the summer had made the Netherlands more resolute about promoting the international legal order.  Peace  justice and development were closely interconnected. In 2015  the world would evaluate the Millennium Development Goals  he said.  The most important Goal was to eradicate extreme poverty within a generation in a way that did not harm economic growth  social equality or the environment.  Fragile States without stability had no chance of achieving the Millennium Goals.  He welcomed the Secretary-General’s initiative to establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER)  and the Netherlands would increase its humanitarian aid  including a contribution of €18 million to fight the disease. He said that the role of women as positive change agents in society could not be emphasized enough  and that their leadership was essential for achieving peace and security.  Perpetrators of crimes that violated international law needed to be brought to justice  no matter how long the process might take.  That was owed not just to the victims of the crash of MH17  but to victims of violence in Syria and Iraq.  The Council must be able to act boldly and decisively.  The organ must be able to act in a crisis  and veto power should be exercised with greater restraint.  In that regard  he saluted the French initiative.  Further  African States were underrepresented on the Council  and the organ’s authority would be enhanced if Member States were more broadly represented. QOHIR RASULZODA  Prime Minister of Tajikistan  said that the sustainable development goals could be achieved only if specific plans were complemented with the development of effective mechanisms for their review and realization.  Addressing issues of financing for sustainable development was equally important for achieving it.  Also important were global partnerships based on the Millennium Declaration.  In that regard  the activities of the Intergovernmental Committee on of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing was of key importance in order to set up a United Nations mechanism for promoting development and the transfer of technology.  As a “pilot” country in the United Nations for achieving the Millennium Goals  Tajikistan planned to carry out a comprehensive review of those goals’ implementation in 2015. The Decade for Action “Water for Life” gave powerful impetus to various initiatives and efforts at different levels to promote access to fresh drinking water and sanitation  he said.  It would also serve as an introduction to integrated management of water resources  strengthen and expand water cooperation  and increase awareness of water-related challenges. Global climate change  the increasing growth of economies and population  the degradation of water sources and the deterioration of water quality  all posed an additional challenge to the international community  he said.  The reduction of fresh water resources caused by climate change could present new obstacles towards achieving sustainable development  and he said a comprehensive review of the International Decade should develop recommendations to strengthen and renew the United Nations water agenda.  Access to modern and affordable energy service was also a priority  and Tajikistan was developing its own potential in that arena in a consistent and planned manner.  That included large-scale exploratory projects in wind and solar energy  which would hopefully contribute to a reduction of detrimental emissions. He said that the international community must implement the United Nations global anti-terrorist strategy to address various threats  including the use of the Internet for the purpose of carrying out terror.  Illicit drug trafficking caused serious problems  and in recent decades  Tajikistan had gained much experience in combating it.  The Drug Control Agency had been successfully functioning for 15 years  and he attached importance to the coordination of efforts with Afghanistan in fighting drug trafficking and in other areas.  Afghanistan was facing new challenges  and expected targeted support from the international community.  With such support  that country would be able to address its upcoming difficulties. Strengthening peace and stability in conflict and post-conflict situations required actual assistance in addressing economic and social issues  as well as the implementation of large-scale infrastructure projects and programmes  he said.  It would be impossible to resolve the issues facing the General Assembly without strengthening and reforming  rationalizing and renewing the entire United Nations system.  That would strengthen and enhance its capacity to respond to modern challenges and counteract modern threats. KAY RALA XANANA GUSMÃO  Prime Minister of Timor-Leste  said that despite high hopes  the Millennium Development Goals had not delivered for fragile and conflict-affected countries.  The challenges facing those countries had only worsened along with the increase in conflicts around the world.  The United Nations had failed to achieve positive results  leading to an increased loss of trust and a crisis of values. More than anything  it was important to understand the root causes of those issues  he said.  When faced with a threat that jeopardizes peace  it was vital to understand the interdependency of the issues in order to reach a consensus.  The use of military force would not establish universal values or build democracies.  As things stood  we were “sliding off into the darkness of war”  upholding outdated principles of an eye for an eye  tooth for a tooth  he said.  Collective efforts to preserve world peace and security must reject the actions of large Powers motivated by strategic interests.  The international community should prioritize mechanisms for resolving issues related to the exclusion  discrimination and marginalization of disadvantaged groups. Having witnessed the near destruction of its country  Timor-Leste knew all too well the consequences of war  he said.  Instead of feeding hatred and vengeance  his country nurtured solidarity and tolerance  providing the foundation for political peace and a genuine reconciliation with Indonesia.  The country’s partnership with the United Nations in rebuilding had taught it important lessons  which it had shared with the world  particularly fragile States.  Timor-Leste was a part of the g7+ group of conflict-afflicted countries that sought to place their needs onto the global development agenda. He voiced concern by the developments in the east and south of the China Sea.  That issue was of vital importance to Timor-Leste  and there was a pressing need to set maritime borders between countries in a clear manner and in line with international law.  Timor-Leste wanted to continue to believe in sovereign rights and international mechanisms such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  but it was weary of the intentions of big  multinationals that acted with “dishonesty and bad faith when dealing with poor countries”.  International conventions would be vital to rebuilding trust in the world system and in preventing tensions on that front from increasing. ERNA SOLBERG  Prime Minister of Norway  said that leaders who gathered for the Climate Summit had taken important steps to mobilize action.  Now it was time to make sure that the positive results were followed through and expanded as the international community prepared for an agreement in Paris next year.  Achieving the eight Millennium Development Goals would create a solid foundation for sustainable development.  As the co-chair of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s Millennium Development Goals advocacy group  she would use every opportunity to help build that foundation over the remaining 462 days until the deadline. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa was a reminder of the fragility of progress and development  she said  urging the building of health-care systems to support courageous and determined individuals  such as the deputy nurse matron Josephine Findu Sellu  who lost 15 nurses to Ebola but who never stopped working in that “death trap”.  Education  particularly for girls  was a “superhighway” to ending poverty  which  together with discrimination and the use of force  often prevented girls from being schooled.  Specifically  sexual violence  abductions and deadly attacks were the most despicable violations.  She condemned the abductions of schoolgirls by Boko Haram in the strongest possible terms  and drew attention to Malala Yousafzai  saying if one schoolgirl could take on the Taliban  then surely the world community could defeat extremism and terrorism.  A girl child growing up in Syria today could not look forward to going to school  because there was no school to go to; and a pregnant teen in South Sudan would not get the maternal health services she needed because travel for health workers was risky. On other matters of concern to Norway  she condemned the Russian Federation’s violation of international law and its continuing destabilization of eastern Ukraine.  Any settlement of the conflict must uphold international law and respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity.  The ceasefire needed to be respected  for which the Russian Federation bore particular responsibility.  While the Security Council was mandated to maintain peace and security  it had failed to effectively address the situations in Syria and Ukraine  because some big Powers still believed in outdated ideas of zero-sum games and spheres of influence. International peace  national security  social development and individual prosperity could best be fostered under a system of democratic governance and human rights  she said.  The promotion and protection of human rights was first and foremost the responsibility of States.  However  the international community faced large implementation gaps.  Attacks  threats  intimidation and reprisals against human rights defenders were increasingly being reported.  Discrimination was widespread  particularly against minorities  such as indigenous people and lesbians  gay  bisexual and transgender persons.  As the world set its future course beyond 2015  peace and stability must be included  climate issues must be addressed  and democratic governance achieved for the development of all. ABDELILAH BENKIRANE  Prime Minister of Morocco  said sustainable development must strike a balance between requirements for social and economic progress and the protection of the environment on the one hand  and safeguarding of rights of future generations on the other.  His country had a distinctive development model rooted in the people’s culture and specific national values.  There also was a national initiative for human development and ambitious programmes in renewable energy  especially solar and wind power  which were key to sustainable development. He said developing countries  especially in Africa  must be treated fairly and their development addressed objectively.  Ready-made prescriptions were not the route to sustainable development  for which there was no single model.  “What applies to the West” could not be the sole criterion for determining other development models.  Colonialism had been very damaging  as it had hindered development  exploited resources and changed customs and cultures.  It also sowed seeds of division within communities and between neighbours.  Colonizers bore a historic responsibility for that and had “no right to ask the countries of the South to introduce radical change rapidly”.  He appealed for more realism and wisdom in the international community  especially when dealing with such countries.  There should also be greater consideration for their circumstances and paths to democracy and development. Nevertheless  he went on  some Western countries continued to hamper the progress of former colonies.  All that Western countries and their institutions did was give lessons and support that was usually conditional.  They asked countries of the South to achieve stability and development over a very short time  and according to very specific  imposed conditions  without accounting for their development processes or specific national circumstances.  There could be no stability without development  or development without stability; both rested on respect for sovereignty and customs  and territorial integrity.  Ratings and classifications of countries also raised many questions  as that process was far removed from the reality of countries of the South and could not give an objective account of their level of human development.  Nevertheless  aid given was often based on such ratings and their “quasi-impossible” conditions. NATALIA GHERMAN  Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and European Integration of the Republic of Moldova  said her country had chosen “a European future”.  She described agreements concluded with the European Union on trade and potential accession that could make the economy more competitive.  The focus was on strengthening democracy and the rule of law at home  fighting corruption  improving the investment climate and enhancing energy security.  Her country’s modernization efforts had been aided by partnerships and she pointed to a new pipeline connecting Moldova to the European Union’s gas network.  That project  along with other strategic infrastructure projects  would be implemented over the coming four years. To realize national ambitions  citizens in Transnistria had to be included  she said  stressing the need for resolution of the conflict and the region’s reintegration into Moldova.  A political settlement was sought and international partners agreed on its basic principles.  Discussions needed to resume without delay within the 5+2 format.  The military of the Russian Federation had to leave the region and peacekeeping arrangements should shift from the current military operation into a civilian multinational mission.  Moldova’s relationship with the Russian Federation was marked by “unjustified trade restrictions” on agricultural exports but trade agreements with the European Union and Turkey would contribute to future diversification.  Events in Ukraine were of great concern and she would never recognize the annexation of the Crimea.  Respect for the United Nations Charter and international law was vital.  She described her country’s contributions to the United Nations  European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  including the deployment of 41 Moldovan soldiers in KFOR  the international peacekeeping force in Kosovo. She said that Moldova had volunteered to provide a midterm evaluation on the Universal Periodic Review by October 2014  while a national strategic programme for demographic security for 2011-2025 was being developed.  Noting Moldova’s aim to become a regional centre of excellence in reproductive health  contributions continued to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) objectives.  As well as sharing migration and development best practices with other countries in the European Union’s Eastern and Southern neighbourhoods  active engagement continued in the work of the Global Forum for Migration and Development.  Freedom of expression was important and her country had fast and affordable Internet connectivity that reached more than 65 per cent of the population. PIERRE MOUKOKO MBONJO  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cameroon  said that since 2010  his country had implemented a strategy for growth and employment aimed at poverty reduction.  The recovery of the economy and public finance  which had fostered the return of growth  augured good results.  But  however significant the progress  it had not eliminated poverty.  More remained to be done in education  health  access to water and electricity  and roads  among other areas.  A majority of developing countries experienced similar situations.  Accordingly  the post-2015 development agenda must not be viewed as an exogenous process  but as one that expressed the needs of target populations.  That was the common position of the African countries. To that end  a mechanism would have to be put in place to follow up on the new system  and the delivery of ODA would have to be more efficient  he continued.  Furthermore  security must be assured  for without it  development was not possible. He cited the deteriorating security situation in the neighbouring Central African Republic  which eliminated any hope of development.  In the north  attacks by Boko Haram  more interested in imposing Sharia law than improving the lot of the population  had driven thousands of displaced persons into his country.  While Cameroon would like to continue to host them  if the situation were to continue  the country’s means would simply not permit it.  He called upon the parties to find a peaceful solution  as Cameroon had done in its conflict with Nigeria over the Bakassi Peninsula.  That had enabled the two countries to resolve their disagreement in keeping with international law and to seal a friendship between them. MANKEUR NDIAYE  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Senegalese Abroad  Senegal  called for a common vision on ways and means to strengthen commitments to build stable and inclusive growth.  Senegal’s model focused on wealth creation and structural transformation and the Plan for Emerging Senegal was a reference point for economic and social policies.  He praised the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and its focus on poverty  infrastructure and structural transformation and commended the work of its steering committee. He described several international issues  including terrorism in the Sahel and West Africa  and the democratic transition in Guinea-Bissau.  Elsewhere in Africa  the Ebola epidemic posed a risk to the entire world.  He was reassured by the United Nations response in the form of its emergency mission and urged support for affected countries.  For its part  Senegal had established a secure aerial humanitarian corridor.  He reaffirmed his commitment to brotherly links between countries of the Maghreb and supported Morocco’s decision to grant a large degree of sovereignty to Western Sahara.  Stressing the importance of the International Criminal Court to restoring peace to countries in regular crisis  he noted the honour given to Senegal in the appointment of Sidiki Kaba as President of the Assembly of States Parties to the Court.  Senegal continued to contribute troops to peacekeeping operations  and the United Nations needed reform if it was to deal with the severe crises now facing the world.  He welcomed the French initiative to suspend the veto in cases of mass atrocities Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-09-24,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11560.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The world’s fasten seat belt light is illuminated  with turbulence testing the multilateral system  national institutions and people's lives  United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the General Assembly today as he opened the sixty-ninth session’s general debate. It had been “a terrible year” for the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter  he said  citing many challenges in such places as the Central African Republic  Gaza  Ukraine  South Sudan  Mali and the Sahel  Somalia  Nigeria  Iraq and Syria.  Yet  he declared  crises like war  poverty and ignorance that were caused by people could be stopped by people. “It may seem as if the world is falling apart ” he said  as crises pile up and disease spreads  but leadership was precisely about finding the seeds of hope and nurturing them into something bigger. “That is our duty.  That is my call to you today ” he told the assembly of Heads of State and Government and other senior Government officials. On peace and security threats  Mr. Ban said Security Council unity was crucial  because when it acted together  its members delivered results.  He noted in particular agreement to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons programmes and to establish a peacekeeping operation for the Central African Republic  as well as timely support for a peace framework in the Great Lakes region of Africa.  In contrast  he added  disunity about Syria had resulted in grave human suffering. Spotlighting the “global conversation” under way on a post-2015 agenda  Mr. Ban said the Millennium Development Goals showed their power by cutting global poverty  child mortality and maternal deaths in half. It was crucial to empower women and girls  he said  stressing that climate change would require a universal agreement and the Ebola crisis  a global response 20 times greater than now. Also delivering an opening statement was General Assembly President Sam Kutesa of Uganda  who said that  although the world today was different from when the United Nations was founded in 1945  one thing had remained the same:  the need to find global solutions to global challenges.  Recalling the words of Mahatma Gandhi  he urged delegates to be the change they wanted to see in the world. He also called for accelerated progress in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals  and urged negotiating parties to put poverty eradication and hunger at the core of the new post-2015 development agenda.  Ensuring adequate means for implementation was the greatest responsibility facing the international community  which was why he made this year’s discussion theme Delivering on and Implementing a Transformative Post-2015 Development Agenda. Nearly 40 Heads of State and Government spoke in today’s general debate  laying out issues of concern to their countries.  Among them was United States President Barack Obama  noting what he called “pervasive unease in the world”.  He cited new dangers  from which no single nation could insulate itself  including the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and violent extremism.  Stressing the importance of abiding by international laws and norms  he said “Russia’s actions in Ukraine challenged the post-war order”. Mr. Obama underlined the need to address the danger posed by religiously motivated fanatics  such as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).  The United States  he said  did not intend to send its troops to occupy foreign lands  but it would support Iraqis and Syrians fighting to reclaim their communities  by using air strikes to roll back ISIL.  He urged Muslim society to reject the ideology of Al-Qaida and ISIL  which  he said  would wilt and die with consistent exposure and confrontation in the light of day. François Hollande  France’s President  said he was addressing the General Assembly with a high level of emotion  following the assassination today of his compatriot  Hervé Gourdel  by a group linked to ISIL in Algeria.  He urged the international community to combat terrorism under the flag of values of human dignity and freedom.  ISIL was not just a threat to the region  but to the whole world  and France was bringing in aerial support to weaken its power  he said. Highlighting a litany of disturbing trends  the President of Turkey  Recep Tayyip Erdoğan  said a broad swath of nations  ranging from Iraq to Syria  Libya to Afghanistan and Ukraine  witnessed deep scars on the conscience of humanity  while poor countries struggled with hunger  malnutrition  communicable diseases and lack of education  while rich ones enjoyed prosperity.  Climate change threatened the whole world  and because all of those issues concerned all of humanity  they were the purview of the United Nations. Touching on another dominant theme was Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz  who said that  when the Millennium Development Goals had been adopted in 2000  Africa had not had a collective vision.  However  it had worked seriously to reach those objectives and today spoke with one voice.  African leaders had taken important decisions on key issues for the continent.  At the same time  he acknowledged the emergence of troubling problems  including the sudden outbreak and rapid spread of Ebola in West Africa.  Given the scope of that challenge  he urged the international community to work efficiently for the provision of vaccines and treatment  support for preventive interventions  and increased investment in scientific research. Several speakers today drew attention to the dividends of democracy  including the President of Brazil  Dilma Rousseff  who described how her country had emerged from two decades of dictatorship 30 years ago.  Democracy  she said  had enabled economic stability  as evidenced by the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) announcement that her country was no longer on the World Hunger Map.  Successful economic policies had generated 21 million jobs and increased the minimum wage  and had also reduced inequality  she added. The need for Security Council reform was another area of focus  with Mongolian President Elbegdorj Tsakhia among those urging acceleration of that process  including the “long-overdue” expansion of both its permanent and non-permanent membership.  Chile’s President  Michelle Bachelet Jeria  sought serious debate on limiting the veto right in the context of the responsibility to protect. Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández Alvarado called for special attention to the growing number of unaccompanied children migrating to the United States  due to violence  drug trafficking and a lack of economic opportunities for their parents at home.  Thousands had been victims of violence  rape and organ trafficking; many had died trying to cross the United States-Mexico border.  “We must create a multinational force capable of successfully confronting this transnational phenomenon ” he said  adding that  yesterday  he handed the Secretary-General the “Alliance for Prosperity” plan  which provided a blueprint for support and opportunities for Central Americans everywhere. Also speaking today were Heads of State and Government  as well as Ministers of Uganda  Spain  Republic of Korea  Qatar  Armenia  Egypt  Jordan  Mexico  Finland  Indonesia  Argentina  Bolivia    Dominican Republic  Kenya  Costa Rica  Nigeria  Rwanda  Montenegro  South Africa  Switzerland  Chad  Estonia  Equatorial Guinea  Sri Lanka  Venezuela  United Kingdom  Denmark  Ukraine and Turkmenistan. The Assembly will meet again at 9 a.m. on Thursday  25 September  to continue its general debate. Opening Remarks BAN KI-MOON  Secretary-General of the United Nations  said that every year hope filled the General Assembly Hall  the hope embodied in the Charter of the Organization.  But this year  the horizon of hope had darkened.  Cold War ghosts had returned to haunt the present.  Diplomacy is on the defensive  undermined by those who believe in violence.  Diversity is under assault by extremists who insist that their way is the only way.  Disarmament is viewed as a distant dream  sabotaged by profiteers of perpetual warfare.  But leadership is precisely about finding the seeds of hope and nurturing them into something bigger. It had been a terrible year for the principles enshrined in the Charter  he said  citing many challenges in such places as the Central African Republic  Gaza  Ukraine  South Sudan  Mali and the Sahel  Somalia  Nigeria  Iraq and Syria.  The world's fasten seat belt light was illuminated.  Turbulence was testing the multilateral system  national institutions and people's lives.  Human rights provided one touchstone for global response.  The Human Rights Up Front initiative aimed to place human rights at the centre of thinking and efforts in the field. The unity of the Security Council was crucial  he said  citing some successes such as the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons programmes; agreement on a peacekeeping operation for the Central African Republic; and timely support for a peace framework in the Great Lakes region of Africa.  In contrast  disunity about Syria had resulted in grave human suffering and loss of the body's credibility.  Global poverty  child mortality and maternal deaths had been cut in half  though more remained to be done  he said.  Those gains showed the power of the Millennium Development Goals and what could be done by working together.  An inspiring global conversation was taking place on an agenda for the next 15 years  including the Conference on Small Island Developing States  the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples and the General Assembly special session on population and development. At the end of 2014  he would present a synthesis report that would set the stage as Member States began their negotiations for the post-2015 agenda.  Transformation was the international community's goal.  But the world's potential could not be unleashed 100 per cent by excluding 50 per cent of its people  namely  women and girls.  Climate change was integral to all hopes  he said  describing yesterday's Climate Summit as a landmark event.  That momentum must be converted into a meaningful  universal climate agreement in Lima this year and in Paris in 2015.  The outbreak of Ebola in West Africa was an unprecedented crisis  and although the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) had been established  the global response needed a 20-fold surge in care  tracking  transport and equipment. It had been a century since the outbreak of World War I and 70 years since the founding of the United Nations  he noted.  Yet the world is still not as peaceful as it could or should be.  There were more man-made crises than natural disasters — war  poverty and ignorance.  Crises caused by people could be stopped by people.  I still have hope.  I draw it from the Charter  our enduring guide in times of dramatic challenge and change  he declared. SAM KUTESA (Uganda)  President of the General Assembly  said that this session and the coming year would be momentous  as it was the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and the anniversary of the groundbreaking Beijing conference on women  among others.  When the United Nations was founded  it was an untested vision  comprising only 51 countries  he said.  The world today was different from how it had been in 1945  but one thing remained the same:  The need to find global solutions to global challenges.  At this time of unprecedented historical opportunity  he urged delegates to recall the words of Mahatma Gandhi:  to be the change they wanted to see in the world. Since the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals  millions of peoples' lives had improved  he said.  A number of targets had been met and some were on course to be met  while others were unlikely to be reached by the target date.  Sanitation targets were lagging  and too many women still died in childbirth.  The international community had to intensify efforts to accelerate progress  and the eradication of poverty and hunger should be at the core of the new post-2015 development agenda.  Ensuring adequate means for implementing that agenda was the greatest responsibility facing the international community  and that was why he made the theme of this year's General Assembly  Delivering on and Implementing a Transformative Post-2015 Development Agenda. Many issues and challenges would require the international community's efforts this session  he said.  Poverty eradication must be at the forefront of the development agenda  and inequities must be addressed.  Improving market access also depended on infrastructure development  an area where developing countries faced particular challenges  which reduced their competitiveness.  The empowerment of women  and in particular increasing their participation in leadership and decision-making positions  was important  as was their economic empowerment.  The topic was of such importance that a high-level thematic debate on that topic would be convened in March 2015. The unprecedented spread of Ebola in some West African countries was the background for this Assembly's recent adoption of a resolution establishing UNMEER  he said.  Other crises also faced the world  with sea levels rising  desertification occurring  and large bodies of water becoming acidified.  Climate change was a dangerous reality of our time.  An increase in violent conflicts around the world meant that strengthening cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations was vital.  The international community had to stand united to combat challenges that could threaten entire regions.  Further  reform of the Security Council was urgent  given that the current composition remained as it had been at the Organization’s founding  when the United Nations had but 51 Member States. Statements DILMA ROUSSEFF  President of Brazil  opening the general debate  noted that it was the eve of elections in her country — elections that would determine the Presidency  State governors and a significant portion of Congress.  That balloting was a celebration of the democracy Brazil achieved almost 30 years ago  after two decades of dictatorial rule.  Through democracy  Brazil had advanced towards economic stability  as evidenced by the announcement by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) that her country was no longer on the World Hunger Map.  That success had been the result of economic policies  which had generated 21 million jobs and increased the minimum wage  and had also reduced inequality. Regarding other developments  particularly in the area of health care  she said her country had reduced child mortality before the deadline established by the Millennium Development Goals  made universal access to primary education a reality and was now focused on achieving the same with regard to secondary education.  Affirmative action policies had facilitated a mass enrolment of poor  indigenous and Afro-descended students into universities.  Additionally  her country had been able to resist its worst consequences of the major global economic crisis triggered in 2008 by the collapse of Lehman Brothers  and instead had followed through with income distribution by stimulating growth and employment  and maintaining investments in infrastructure. Nonetheless  she said  it was still imperative to eliminate the disparity between the growing importance of developing countries in the global economy and their insufficient representation in the decision-making of international financial institutions  such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.  The delay in expansion of voting rights of developing countries was unacceptable.  On other matters  she noted the significant challenges world leaders faced in the areas of peace  collective security and the environment  and called for the long overdue reform of the Security Council. Stressing that climate change was among the greatest challenges faced at present  she said that Brazil had been doing its part by committing to a voluntary reduction of 36 to 39 per cent of projected emissions by 2020  and reducing deforestation by 79 per cent between 2010 and 2013  among other endeavours.  In its fight against discrimination  Brazil was as committed to combating homophobia as it was to combating racism and violence against women.  Its Supreme Court had recognized same-sex civil unions  guaranteeing the full range of civil rights to all  illustrating her country’s belief in the dignity of all human beings and the universality of fundamental rights. Further  on the rights of citizens  she recalled an important 2013 discussion on human rights and the Internet promoted by Brazil and Germany  noting that her country intended to deepen that discussion in the current session.  She was pleased by the international community’s engagement in enhancing the current governance architecture of the Internet and noted the holding  at Brazil’s initiative  of the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance — NETmundial — in São Paulo in April.  Her country was committed to working on that issue further  and stood ready to tackle other significant challenges faced by the United Nations and its Member States. BARACK OBAMA  President of the United States  said that the international community had come together at a crossroads between war and peace  between disorder and integration  between fear and hope.  There were signposts of progress worldwide.  The shadow of world war that had existed at the founding of the United Nations had been lifted  and the prospect of war between major Powers had declined.  More people lived under Governments they elected  and hundreds of millions of human beings had been freed from poverty  with the proportion of those living in extreme poverty cut in half.  The world’s economy continued to strengthen after its worst financial crisis  and indeed  now was the best time in human history to be born  as people were more likely than ever to become literate  healthy  and free to pursue dreams. And yet  he said  “there is a pervasive unease in the world — a sense that the very forces that have brought us together have created new dangers.  It was difficult for any single nation to insulate itself from global challenges  including the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and the Russian Federation's aggression in Europe.  Those problems demanded urgent attention  but too often  Governments failed to enforce global norms when it was inconvenient to do so. He said that there were two defining questions at the root of many global challenges — whether the nations here today would be able to renew the purpose of the United Nations’ founding  and whether they would together reject the “cancer” of violent extremism.  All nations  big or small  must meet their responsibility to observe and enforce international norms.  Russia’s actions in Ukraine challenged the post-war order.  That country believed that might makes right  in a world in which one nation’s borders could be redrawn by another  and civilized people were not allowed to recover the remains of their loved ones in a plane crash because of the truth it might expose. America believed that right makes might  he declared  adding that a different path was available — the path of diplomacy and peace.  If the Russian Federation took that path — one that for stretches of the post-cold war period resulted in prosperity for the Russian people — then sanctions could be lifted.  In past years  the two sides had been able to reduce their nuclear stockpiles under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and cooperate to remove and destroy Syria’s declared chemical weapons.  That was the kind of cooperation the United States was prepared to pursue again if the Russian Federation changed course.  America was also pursuing a diplomatic resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue  he said  stressing that it was possible to reach a solution that met Iran's energy needs.  The United States was also committed to a development agenda that eradicated extreme poverty by 2030  and was pursuing ambitious reductions in its carbon emissions. Turning to the violent extremism ravaging so many parts of the Muslim world  he quoted President John F. Kennedy:  “Terror is not a new weapon.  Throughout history it has been used by those who could not prevail  either by persuasion or example.”  America had waged a focused campaign against Al-Qaida and its associates.  At the same time  the United States was not and never would be at war with Islam.  That religion taught peace.  There was a need to take concrete steps to address the danger posed by religiously motivated fanatics.  The terrorist group known as “ISIL” must be degraded and ultimately destroyed  as it had terrorized all whom they encountered in Iraq and Syria.  Mothers  sisters and daughters had been subjected to rape and innocent children gunned down.  The United States did not intend to send its troops to occupy foreign lands.  Instead  it would support Iraqis and Syrians fighting to reclaim their communities.  It would use its military might in a campaign of air strikes to roll back ISIL.  Muslim communities must explicitly  forcefully and consistently reject the ideology of Al-Qaida and ISIL  which would wilt and die with consistent exposure and confrontation in the light of day. The Security Council would today adopt a resolution that underscored the responsibility of States to counter violent extremism  he said.  But resolutions must be followed by tangible commitments.  Next year  Member States should be prepared to identify the concrete steps they had taken to counter extremist ideologies.  The cycle of conflict — especially sectarian conflict — must be ended as no one was winning that fight.  A brutal civil war in Syria had already killed nearly 200 000 people and displaced millions more.  Iraq had come close to plunging back into the abyss.  Together with partners  America was training and equipping the Syrian opposition to counter ISIL terrorists and the brutality of the regime of Bashar al-Assad.  However  the only lasting solution to Syria’s civil war was political:  an inclusive transition of administration that responded to the legitimate aspirations of all citizens  regardless of ethnicity or creed. The countries of the Arab and Muslim world must focus on the extraordinary potential of their people  especially the youth  he continued.  To those young people  he said:  You come from a great tradition that stands for education  not ignorance; innovation  not destruction; the dignity of life  not murder.  Where women were full participants in politics and the economy  societies were more likely to succeed.  Such positive change need not come at the expense of tradition and faith.  Ultimately  the task of rejecting sectarianism and extremism was a generational one for the people of the Middle East themselves.  No external Power could bring about a transformation of hearts and minds  but America would be a respectful and constructive partner.  On the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis  he said  the status quo in the West Bank and Gaza is not sustainable.  He stood up for the principle that Israelis  Palestinians  the region and the world would be more just with two States living side by side  in peace and security. America’s critics  Mr. Obama said  would be quick to point out that his country had plenty of problems within its own borders.  That was true.  It had its own racial and ethnic tensions.  But America welcomed the scrutiny of the world; it was a country that had steadily worked to address its problems and made its union more perfect.  America was not the same as it was 100 years ago  50 years ago  or even a decade ago because it fought for its ideals; because it was willing to criticize itself  held leaders accountable  and insisted on a free press and independent judiciary; and because it addressed differences in the open space of democracy with respect for the rule of law. YOWERI KAGUTA MUSEVENI  President of Uganda  greeted assembled delegates making note that the President of the General Assembly was his country's Foreign Minister.  Reviewing historical facts  he traced current problems affecting Africa back to events from the Middle Ages  when European colonization began.  Some positive change was beginning to take effect  however  in particular an increase in the continent's middle class and purchasing power  which was growing at a rate of 3.2 per cent each year.  This growth was occurring despite inadequate infrastructure  which still limited the continent's potential. Indeed  he continued  there were several bottlenecks hindering African development.  Foremost among them was the pseudo-ideology of sectarianism of religion or tribe  which was fuelling most of the conflicts in Africa and causing havoc in the Middle East and North Africa.  This ideology  which resulted from uninformed outsiders linking up with pseudo-ideologists  was not aligned with the people's real interests.  Only parasites revel in such schemes  he said  adding that ideology should be banished and treated with contempt. Turning to the situation in Uganda  he said it was undergoing a socioeconomic transformation  building numerous infrastructure projects.  Those included roads  electricity systems  railways  information and communications technology networks  a universal education system and a pan-Ugandan health system.  Additionally  Ugandan markets had been integrated with East African local markets and the Common Market for East and Southern Africa.  Uganda welcomed investments  trade access and tourists  and in some cases welcomed security partnerships approved by the African Union and other Member States. DON FELIPE VI  King of Spain  said it was a great honour and privilege to address the General Assembly at the beginning of his reign.  Presenting the potential benefits to the international community of a “renewed” Spain  he highlighted the pursuit of peace  liberty  justice and human rights in all nations.  Today  his country was exemplary in its commitment to the dignity of the human being  in its solidarity with the underprivileged and in its firm will to build a better reality for all.  Recalling that it would soon be four decades since the beginning of Spain’s political transition from a dictatorship to a democracy  he said his country had built a social and democratic order based on the rule of law  which protected all citizens.  On economic development  he said Spain  particularly since the second half of the last century  had placed its economy among the first in the world and among the most open and competitive.  It strongly supported a global and sustainable way of economic development that generated employment and protected individuals and their social rights; it was also respectful of the environment and mindful of international norms.  On cultural diversity  he said the strength of Spanish as a universal language  which was shared by dozens of countries and hundreds of millions of people on all continents  contributed significantly to a greater cultural and linguistic diversity in the global arena.  In that regard  the Spanish language must fully assume its formal position as an official language of the United Nations and as a working language that was fully used and represented. He also said that continental integration of the European Union was an objective of his country in its pursuit of a Europe that was more united and cohesive.  Likewise  Spain aimed to contribute towards the stability of the Middle East and the Arab world  recognizing that peace in those regions was essential to achieving peace in the world.  The international community’s primary objective must be to prevent wars  he stressed  adding that should it fail to do so  it must protect and assist the innocent victims.  A tapestry version of the Guernica by the Spaniard Pablo Picasso  which hung outside the Security Council entrance  served to remind all of the fatal consequences of the international community’s inability to prevent and resolve conflicts.  “When brutality triumphs in one part of the world  no one is beyond its reach.  We are all its victims.” As part of its unconditional support to the United Nations and in service of the international community  he said his country was taking another step forward as a candidate for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for the period 2015-2016.  As there could be no lasting peace or security without sustainable development  Spain had contributed $30 billion to global development  nearly $1 billion of which was earmarked for attainment of the Millennium Development Goals through a fund created by Spain and co-led by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) — the largest contribution made by any single country. Recalling that it had been 30 years since his father  King Juan Carlos I  had addressed the Assembly for the first time  he said that today Spain was open to a new age and remained ready to be an active and responsible member of the international community to uphold a stronger United Nations. MOHAMED OULD ABDEL AZIZ  President of Mauritania  said he was pleased to present what Africans had done in terms of achievement and development.  At the same time  he appreciated the challenges facing their continent  as well as their expectations of the international community.  He also understood their aspirations in the construction of their continent’s future.  Several African nations had experienced high levels of growth despite the global economic crisis.  The average rate had reached nearly 6 per cent  owing to wise economic policies that had been adopted by African Governments  such as those that promoted local and foreign investment  the creation of new infrastructure and a particular focus on societies’ most vulnerable members. He said that the achievement of food sufficiency  the development of agricultural industries and poverty reduction in rural areas constituted core objectives of the African Union.  Hence  2014 had been declared the year of agriculture and self-sufficiency in Africa.  The agricultural sector employed close to 60 per cent of its workforce and represented one third of the continent’s gross domestic product (GDP).  In that framework  the African Summit had recommended that 10 per cent of African State budgets be allocated to agriculture.  When the Millennium Development Goals had been adopted in 2000  Africa did not have a collective vision  he added  but it nonetheless had worked seriously to reach those objectives and today spoke with one voice.  African leaders had taken important decisions on key issues for the continent.  However  despite such efforts  which included the fight against AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis  and increasing access to resources  they still needed improvement.  The sudden outbreak of the Ebola virus posed a major challenge due to the rapid spread of the disease and the fact that measures to contain it remained insufficient.  As Africa had not succeeded in facing that epidemic  he appealed to the international community to work efficiently for the provision of vaccines and treatment  support preventive interventions  increase investments in scientific research and provide assistance to affected countries. On the phenomenon of illegal immigration and its consequent tragedies  he called on the international community to find rapid and efficient solutions  stressing that  “we cannot just count the bodies washed up on the beaches or undertake rescues at sea of thousands in unsafe and cramped boats.”  On the other hand  African society had allowed positive discrimination to guarantee more gender justice in favour of women  while youth were prioritized in development plans and national policies.  As it was estimated that the African population would reach three billion by 2050  with youth accounting for two thirds of that number  investments in infrastructure and social services were essential.  In the area of security  he said the fight against terrorism remained an international responsibility  and called for close collaboration.  Despite the fruitful cooperation between the United Nations and the African Council  the situations in Somalia  Libya  northern Nigeria and Central Africa remained concerning as did the situations in Syria  Iraq and Ukraine.  The African continent aimed to reinforce its presence in international institutions  enhancing their representation of peoples and nations.  In that regard  Africa  which played a significant role in the world community  must be justly represented through a permanent seat in the Security Council. MICHELLE BACHELET JERIA  President of Chile  acknowledged that the Security Council had helped to address and prevent crises through robust peacekeeping operations  but noted that  regrettably  it had not been able to reach an agreement on what action to take on many occasions.  That highlighted the need for reform  which required political decisions.  Calling for a serious debate on limiting the right of veto in the case of crimes involving the responsibility to protect  she supported the Security Council’s enlargement and permanent membership for Germany  Brazil  Japan and India. She was concerned about the 3 million refugees created by the crisis in Syria  she continued  as well as the activities of terrorist groups such as “ISIS” and the “cruel violence” in Gaza.  Her country was prepared to increase their humanitarian commitments and would consider accepting refugees from those conflict zones.  Turning to Ukraine  she highlighted the need to respect the principle of territorial integrity and  at the same time  protect the rights of minorities. The post-2015 development agenda was a great opportunity to tackle social and development issues through specific and measurable goals  she said.  In addition  issues concerning women  peace and security were priorities on the Security Council agenda.  Addressing climate change  she said that Chile had only a marginal effect on the problem  since it accounted for only 0.25 per cent of carbon emissions.  However  because it suffered the consequences  it wanted to be part of the solution. Voicing her country’s aspiration to become a member of the United Nations Economic and Social Council  she also expressed interest in a greater coordination of initiatives and instruments to facilitate South-South cooperation by middle-income countries.  In that regard  the Government had enacted legal provisions to fully open the economy to imports from the 48 least developed countries without duties or quotas. PARK GEUN-HYE  President of the Republic of Korea  highlighted the need to return to the United Nations its founding spirit of putting people first and promoting cooperation among nations.  The United Nations should play a central role in arranging more rapid and efficient responses.  In her call for prevention of the development and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  she underlined the urgency of resolving the North Korean nuclear issue  which she called the “single-greatest threat to peace on the Korean peninsula and in North-East Asia”. About the human rights situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  she said that that country and the international community should take the necessary measures to implement the recommendations adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Council last March.  To reinforce those efforts  the United Nations office would soon be set up in the Republic of Korea to investigate human rights abuses in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. As the post-2015 development goals were being set  the Republic of Korea  she went on  was ready to play a bridging role between developed and developing countries.  In particular  she expressed her support for the United Nations education initiatives  including the Secretary-General’s Global Education First Initiative.  She also promised that  as the host of the 2015 World Education Forum  her country would make efforts to reach an agreement on the new education objectives for the next 15 years. She said climate challenge was not a burden  but an opportunity to unleash new value  markets and jobs through technology innovations.  As the host country of the Green Climate Fund and the Green Growth Global Institute  the Republic of Korea supported international efforts to strengthen developing countries’ mitigation and adaptation capacities. With regard to the division of the Korean peninsula  she urged the international community to stand with them in tearing down what she called “the world’s last remaining wall of division”.  A unified Korea would be the starting point for a world without nuclear weapons; it would offer a fundamental solution to the North Korean human rights issue and help unblock a stable and cooperative North-East Asia. SHEIKH TAMIM BIN HAMAD AL-THANI  Amir of Qatar  said that at this time when the safety and security of all humanity was being affected by the latest developments  compliance with the provisions of international law and respect for the principles of human rights were at the base of achieving international peace and security.  Turning to the situation in the Middle East  where he noted that the Gaza Strip had recently been destroyed on a large scale  he said that the aggression seen there amounted to a crime against humanity.  The Security Council should pass a resolution under Chapter VII of the Charter forcing Israel to take numerous steps ultimately leading to a permanent settlement of the Palestinian issue. Turning to Syria  he lamented the fact that the international community had not acted when Qatar had warned precisely of today's scenario coming to pass.  The Syrian people had become stuck between the terrorism of the regime and that of extremist forces  which thrived in the swamp of violence.  The international community should provide all aspects of humanitarian aid to the people of Syria  and the Security Council should support Syrians against the terrorism of the regime and terrorist forces.  The first danger  he said  had begotten the second. Throughout the Middle East and North Africa  he said  terrorism threatened security and stability and hampered development.  All civilizations had known terrorism  but the communities from which it sprang were the most affected.  That scourge was hostile to diversity and pluralism  which enriched society.  The international community needed to stand beside Iraq to lay the foundations for a society free of sectarian and ethnic conflict.  In the same context  the Libyan people's aspirations must be supported.  Libyan political forces should follow the path of national dialogue to achieve a formula for the governance they want. His country was encouraged by the successful transfer of power in Yemen  which he said was the outcome of national dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations  supported by the Security Council.  He warned against those who would offer sectarian conflict and factional interests in place of good governance.  On the subject of Qatar's national achievements  he listed his country's ranking as thirty-first globally on the United Nations Human Development Index  noting that it would continue to follow its national strategy for development in various fields.  Having contributed $2.2 billion in governmental humanitarian aid over the last five years  Qatar would also continue its active role in mediating and providing a platform for dialogue. SERZH SARGSYAN  President of Armenia  affirming his country’s support for the initiatives of the President of the General Assembly and the effective shaping of a post-2015 agenda  called attention to the upcoming April 2015 centennial of the Armenian genocide  asserting that inadequate condemnation of the event had paved the way for future crimes of mass murder.  He emphatically thanked all those countries and individuals who had recognized and condemned it  “since denial is a phase of the crime of genocide.” His country had not conditioned normalization of relations with Turkey on recognition of the genocide  and had initiated the process that led to the signing of the Zurich Protocols in 2009  he said.  However  the Turkish Government had now declared that it would not ratify the Protocols unless Armenia ceded Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan.  Armenia would not bargain away the motherland  he stated  and there was now consideration of recalling the Protocols from Parliament. Hate crimes against minorities were now rife in Syria and Iraq  he said  noting that just two days ago  on Armenian Independence Day  the Church of All Saint Martyrs in Deir-ez-Zor  Syria  which was dedicated to victims of the Armenian genocide  had been blown up by terrorists.  Tens of thousands of Armenians of Aleppo were imperilled.  His country had underlined on numerous occasions the need to defend minorities in Syria and northern Iraq  and he was encouraged by the unified stance of the international community in that regard. Returning to the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh  he said that it was now more than 20 years since Azerbaijan  through a “maximalist stance” and bellicose statements  had obstructed the efforts of the international community to bring about a just and peaceful settlement.  Azerbaijan was exploiting the four Security Council resolutions on the issue to justify their obstruction  even though that country had failed to implement their fundamental provisions and was gravely violating humanitarian norms by its cruel treatment of Armenian civilian prisoners. He maintained that the recent vote held in Scotland had once again proved that referendums were increasingly seen as a legal model for the settlement of ethnic conflicts.  A referendum was the core element of the proposal on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict put forward by the Co-Chairs of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  the only specialized structure mandated by the international community to deal with the conflict.  He criticized attempts to move the issue to other platforms and depict it as a territorial dispute or a matter of religious solidarity. ABDEL FATTAH AL SISI  President of Egypt  said Egyptians had made history in the past two years  first revolting against corruption and despotism to claim their right to freedom  dignity and social justice  and then refusing to succumb to the tyranny of a faction that in the name of religion had put its narrow interests before those of the people  seeking to undermine the democratic process and national institutions.  Egypt had warned about the aims of extremist groups that were transforming the Jewish  Christian and Muslim values of justice  compassion and mercy into grim sectarianism and destructive civil and regional wars.  Since his election as President  Mr. Al Sisi said he had sought to build a civil democratic State by adhering to a road map for the future agreed upon by national power  which would be completed with the holding of parliamentary elections. “Our aim is to build a ‘New Egypt’ […] a State that respects the rights and freedoms  honours its duties  and ensures the co-existence of its citizens without exclusion or discrimination ” he said.  That State should also respect and enforce the rule of law  guarantee freedom of speech and religion  and work towards growth  prosperity and a promising future for all Egyptians.  To attain that  the Government began implementing an ambitious programme to spur development and build the foundation for a free market  investor-friendly economy by 2030.  The New Suez Canal Project was proof of the New Egypt’s resolve to forge a better future for its children.  He invited everyone to participate in the conference on national and regional economic development in Egypt next February. Such steps reflected the social contract  in Egypt’s new Constitution  to build a State with strong institutions  governed by the rule of law and the principle of separation of powers  and one not held back by terrorism  he said.  Egypt had suffered from the scourge of terrorism since the 1920s.  It was vital not to allow the handful of extremists committing atrocities in the name of religion to abuse Islam and offend the 1.5 billion Muslims that cherished its noble values.  Everyone must intensify cooperation and coordination to end support for such terrorist organizations.  The crises facing the region from terrorism could be resolved by applying the principles of equality for all citizens and respect for the rule of law  and by decisively confronting extremist forces. Egypt had partnered with Libya’s neighbours on an initiative to end terrorism and bloodshed in Libya  help strengthen elected Libyan institutions and preserve territorial integrity  he said.  To succeed  the smuggling of arms into Libya must stop.  Turning to Syria  he said it was possible to put into place a political framework that fulfilled the Syrian peoples’ aspirations without compromising with terrorists or replicating the situation against which they initially rebelled.  He stressed Egypt’s support towards that end.  On Iraq  he said the formation of a new Government was a “significant development” that restored hope for achieving stability  regaining areas currently under “ISIS’” control  maintaining Iraq’s territorial integrity  and ending the bloodshed. The Palestinian issue remained a top priority for Egypt  he said.  The Palestinians’ aspiration to establish an independent State with East Jerusalem as its capital  based on the peace process  was not to be negotiated  as that would erode the basis for comprehensive peace in the region.  National security in other Arab nations was an integral part of Egypt’s own national security.  His country’s vision of international relations was founded on respect for international law and mutual respect.  Egypt’s aspirations to become a non-permanent Security Council member during the 2016-2017 period stemmed from its desire to achieve the Organization’s aims and protect the interests of developing countries  particularly in Africa.  He invited Member States to support its candidacy. ABDULLAH II IBN AL HUSSEIN  King of Jordan  stressed that the world’s challenges had grown significantly since the last general debate.  The security of every nation would be shaped by the fate of his country’s region  the Middle East.  The global community must act together to tackle the issues facing that part of the world and provide opportunities for dialogue and reconciliation. He also emphasized the importance of respect among different religions  reiterating that the teachings of Islam prohibited violence against Christians and other religious groups.  Jordan was at the forefront of interfaith dialogue and had spearheaded a number of such initiatives.  Because of the abhorrent crimes against religious groups recently seen in Syria and Iraq  Jordan would propose a draft resolution that would make such acts a crime against humanity. Pointing once again to the situation in Syria and Iraq  he said that the international community should work towards a “consensus-driven political solution” that addressed the myriad issues that had arisen as a result of the crisis  including displacement.  Refugee flows had taken a heavy toll on his country  which had sheltered nearly 1.4 million Syrians.  The burden on Jordanians  infrastructure and already-limited resources had become overwhelming. Shifting to the topic of Palestinian rights and statehood  he said that the future of the region could not be addressed without addressing that pivotal issue.  He expressed concern at the “dangerous halt in the progress towards peace”  and called for a mobilization in international efforts to rebuild Gaza and marshal a united  global response to achieve “once-and-for-all a lasting settlement”.  That  he asserted  would create the foundation necessary to re-launch final status negotiations on the basis of the Arab Peace Initiative.  He underscored that the path to a comprehensive peace settlement must involve a two-State solution as that would offer security and normal relations for Israel with its neighbours as well as a viable  sovereign State for the Palestinians along the 1967 lines. FRANÇOIS HOLLANDE  President of France  said he was addressing the General Assembly with a high level of emotion  following the assassination of his compatriot  Hervé Gourdel  by a group linked to ISIL in Algeria today.  He condemned the execution  and urged the international community to fight against terrorism under the flag of values of human dignity and freedom.  France was fully committed to this fight.  Today  ISIL was not just a threat to the region  but to the entire world.  The group was provoking attacks  organizing abductions  and recruiting and training fighters from all over the world to reproduce the threat of terrorism.  In response  France was bringing in aerial support to weaken ISIL’s power. He said there could be no sustainable solution without resolving the Syrian crisis.  To that end  France supported the democratic Syrian opposition as the only legitimate representation of the Syrian people.  Today  France had experienced a tragedy  but it had a role to play and it would not renounce it.  The fight against terrorism would be pursued and accelerated with respect for the rule of law  State sovereignty  and United Nations values. Turning to Ebola  he sympathized with affected African friends  and warned that they could not expect to contain the epidemic in affected countries without help.  France and the world had a responsibility to provide those countries with the necessary care  protection and economic assistance.  Without solidarity  all other countries would be affected  he added. He also stressed that the world must address climate change  which was not only threatening to the current generation but also to the next one.  Climate change was a threat to security because more people were displaced by that phenomenon than by wars.  France had taken responsibility by deciding to organize a climate conference in 2015.  All must do everything possible in Paris to ensure that a binding global agreement was reached. He reiterated that it was a sad moment today in France  but it was also a time to take responsibility  reduce inequalities  combat terrorism and fight climate change.  He was certain that those challenges could be dealt with  if the world was united.  “Together we can achieve this victory ” he concluded. ENRIQUE PEÑA NIETO  President of Mexico  praised the United Nations for leading international efforts on a range of dangers facing humanity  from hunger and pandemics to climate change.  With all those new  border-transcending challenges  the world needed change at the United Nations  he said  calling for a more “effective  efficient  transparent and representative” Organization.  Security Council reform was of utmost importance  and Mexico believed it should be enlarged by increasing the number of non-permanent members  thus creating “long-term seats with the possibility of immediate re-election based on a more equitable geographic representation.  The permanent members should refrain from using their veto power in cases of grave violations of international humanitarian law  he said. Arms trafficking inflicted serious damage to the world’s societies  he said  adding that for the Arms Trade Treaty to address that  it was imperative not only to sign the text  but to ratify it.  Next year  Mexico would host the first Conference of State Parties.  He then turned to the situation of young people and children  saying it was time to launch a “joint global action” against all forms of bullying.  Touching on the situation in his own country  he said that Mexico had managed to reach agreement among all political forces on the need for reforms  which had allowed improvements to education  modernization of the telecommunications sector  and a renewal of the judicial and accountability systems.  He attributed the country’s ability to achieve those changes to dialogue and consensus. As Mexico had dared to transform itself  so could the United Nations  he said  noting that the Organization  at nearly 70 years old  needed to evolve in keeping with the rest of the world.  The talent and wisdom needed for that transformation were present — what was now needed was for Member States to listen  discuss  tolerate and yield.  Mexico supported United Nations peacekeeping and had decided to participate in the missions in order to provide humanitarian assistance to civilian populations.  The United Nations seventieth anniversary next year was an opportunity to drive change  he concluded  reiterating his country’s commitment to the Organization.  SAULI NIINISTÖ  President of Finland  said that recent crises in the world had violated “the core values and rules upon which the United Nations is based”.  The situation in Ukraine had a deep impact on Europe’s security  but the matter should be of concern to the entire world  as upholding the rule-based global system was a precondition for peace and security  human rights and development.  “If we cease to protect this system  it will cease to protect us ” he warned. He asserted that the Security Council had not upheld its responsibilities in Ukraine or Syria.  With that  he called for its reform of veto use.  At the same time  he praised the General Assembly for adopting an earlier resolution on Ukraine’s territorial integrity.  Still  more could have been done by that body to condemn the actions of the Russian Federation  which must take “active steps” to stabilize the situation in eastern Ukraine. On Syria  he urged the world not to abandon the conflict-ridden State  which had witnessed half its population perish or flee to neighbouring countries.  The international community must tackle that challenge together and show the same resolve it had shown after the chemical attacks months ago.  He called on the Council to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court  a mechanism that “must be used when the national justice system is not able to deliver”.   With so many conflicts unfolding  international cooperation was needed more than ever  he said.  The world shared important challenges  such as climate change  and with the post-2015 agenda nearing  it must aspire to a new kind of global commitment that met the needs of planet Earth; “all resources and means should be mobilized” to meet those pledges.  While public funding for sustainable development was important  particularly in areas affected by conflict  innovation  trade  technology and investments must play a stronger role. SUSILO BAMBANG YUDHOYONO  President of Indonesia  said that in his country’s effort to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  he had learned one key lesson: the most important driver of change lay not only in good governance but in smart governance.  It involved innovative leadership and active public participation  and was needed to achieve desired results.  With smart governance  Indonesia had managed to increase its national income per capita by 400 per cent in just a decade.  Noting that improved relations among major Powers had created ample space for new strategic and economic opportunities  he said global trade had reached $23 trillion  which was an almost six-fold growth since one year after the end of the cold war in 1990  with the fastest growth occurring from 2000 through 2013  at a rate that was one and a half times faster than that of the preceding two decades.  That coincided with the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals.  The value of global investments had reached almost $1.5 trillion in 2013 for a near seven-fold growth since 1990.  That positive geopolitical development had allowed South-East Asia to develop stronger cooperation and develop the region’s architecture. Today  however  relations among major Powers were worsening and those that were previously stable and cooperative were now marked with volatility and tension  he said.  The international community had an obligation to resolve major issues in order to end the suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza and the rest of the Occupied Territory  to deliver the still elusive two-State solution  to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and to find an effective and durable solution to the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Iraq.  It was not enough to simply call for peaceful co-existence; the twenty-first century required world Powers to “turn the trust deficit into a new strategic trust”  not just among themselves  but also among emerging Powers and all Member States.  With firm resolve  that was indeed possible  as seen by what had transpired in South-East Asia. He recalled that in the second half of the 1960s  South-East Asian nations were poor  divided  insecure  threatened by a war raging in their neighbourhood and ignorant of each other.  However  the establishment of Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) had enabled countries in the region to form the habits of dialogue and consultation and learn to trust one another.  Today  those once-divided countries belonged to ASEAN and were all drivers of regional affairs.  They had peacefully resolved a number of sensitive inter-State and intra-State conflicts  while others were being addressed through dialogue and negotiation.  The aspiration for peace and co-existence of Indonesia and the ASEAN region  he said  was “the antidote to the poison” of fundamentalist prejudice and intolerance  as practiced by a terrorist group in Iraq and Syria  which falsely styled itself as the Islamic State.  The ideology of ISIS not only betrayed the true teaching of Islam as a religion of peace  but also harmed the Islamic ummah throughout the world.  On a planet marked by turbulent transitions in the Middle East  Indonesia had shown that democracy  Islam  modernity and human rights went together.  He hoped that the pioneering spirit  which had allowed Indonesia to open a new chapter of non-violent relations with Timor-Leste and peacefully resolve its overlapping maritime borders with Viet Nam  the Philippines and Singapore  among others  would be the same pioneering spirit that could aid the international community in conquering poverty and social injustice  and in creating a culture of peace among all faiths. CRISTINA FERNÁNDEZ  President of Argentina  said most of the problems facing the world today resulted from a lack of democratic multilateralism.  In that context  she welcomed the vote by the Assembly on resolution 68/304  to restructure the foreign debts of all countries.  That had long been before the Assembly  which had called for reform of the international financial system and the Security Council.  Argentina had previously experienced the kind of economic and financial crisis that had spread throughout the world in 2008  when  in 2001  it had been forced to default on its sovereign debt.  Contributing to that collapse were the creditors’ terms that had been forced upon the country.  As a result  there had not only been economic collapse  but a social and political implosion as well.  Argentina owed 162 per cent of its GDP.  Its creditors  having contributed to that  were obligated to shoulder some of the burden. The country had been able to formulate agreements with 92.4 per cent of its creditors  enabling it to improve the condition of its people  she said.  Today the IMF recognized that the economic growth rate achieved by Argentina between 2004 and 2011 was the third largest in the world.  In fact  Argentina now had the best growth in Latin America  which had been possible because $193 billion in debt had been restructured.  Today  it carried one of the lowest debt loads in the world. However  she added  there were “vulture funds” of individuals who would not participate in the restructuring  but instead sought recourse in the court systems.  Some reaped more than 1 600 per cent profit over a five-year period.  Those “vulture funds” amounted to economic terrorism  creating poverty  misery and hunger through the sin of speculation.  For that reason  she called for a convention on multilateralism. Highlighting the attack on the Israeli Embassy  she said that Argentina had also experienced political terrorism.  The country had sought to bring the perpetrators to justice  including through a memorandum negotiated with Iran  enabling the accused Iranian citizens to make statements in Argentina’s courts.  Dialogue was essential  and in that context  she recognized the need for a two-State solution in the Middle East.  She called on the Assembly to recognize Palestine as a State and full Member of the Assembly  noting that Israel must also be secure within its borders.  “In a time of economic vultures and hawks of war  we need more doves of peace ” she said. Turning to the Security Council  she said that as long as the votes of the five permanent members counted more than those of other countries  nothing would ever be resolved.  There would be a real beginning to a solution when the Assembly  where each member had one vote  became the sovereign body of the Organization.  As a non-permanent member of the Council  she had questions about who had armed the “bad guys”  some of whom were now starting to cooperate.  But one group had led to another  and now there was ISIS.  “Where does this come from?” she asked.  Some might be able to answer such questions  she said.  In closing  she expressed thanks to all who had supported resolution 68/304 in the face of pressure not to do so. RECEP TAYYIP ERDOĞAN  President of Turkey  said the current session was being held on the 100th anniversary of the First World War  whose effects still deprived peoples of stability  peace and prosperity a century later.  A broad swath of nations  ranging from Iraq to Syria  Libya to Afghanistan and Ukraine  witnessed deep scars on the conscience of humanity.  Poor countries struggled with hunger  malnutrition  communicable diseases and lack of education  while rich ones enjoyed prosperity.  Climate change threatened the whole world  and because those issues concerned all of humanity  they were the purview of the United Nations. He said that millions of children worldwide had lost their lives in the last year  and 17 000 of those killed had been in Syria.  Others had been severely injured.  This year  490 children had been killed so far and 3 000 injured as “a direct target” in the Gaza Strip of Palestine.  Children playing on beaches  running in parks  taking refuge in mosques or schools  or curled against their mothers’ bosoms  were mercilessly killed before the eyes of the world.  However those objecting to murders in Iraq and Syria were subjected to certain unfair and groundless accusations  and immediately accused of supporting terrorism.  Those who stood by and remained unresponsive to the killing of children and women were openly participating in those crimes against humanity. That double standard  he said  led to significant and serious mistrust  including towards the United Nations; it harmed a sense of justice and led millions of people to despair.  And that mistrust was one of the main sources of power for the growth of international terrorism.  Indifference to the killing of children was a lifeline for terrorism all around the world.  Problems in Iraq had caused major destruction for the Iraqi peoples and had recently spread beyond its borders.  Unfortunately  that had given terrorist organizations free reign in the region  which had a direct effect on countries there  particularly on Turkey.  Hopefully  a new Government in Iraq would mean a fresh start  he said  regretting that the Syrian crisis was now spilling over the borders of Iraq as well. Achieving a two-State solution for Palestine was of utmost importance  he said  stressing that it was no longer time to speak to the issue only  but to act.  Thousands of people were dying from inaction  he declared  urging the United Nations to address those problems without further delay.  The “world was more than five”  he said  adding that the situation in the Security Council was not acceptable  given that decisions taken at the United Nations could be dependent on a single country.  The Organization had been unable to find effective solutions regarding the conflicts in Palestine  Syria and elsewhere  and could have prevented so many deaths.  He did not understand how the killing of 2 000 civilians by chemical weapons was a crime while the killing of 200 000 by conventional weapons was not.  All killings were crimes regardless of weapons used.  The United Nations had done nothing but watch events unspool in Egypt  and the person committing a coup was legitimized.  If that was a legitimate path to power  why did the United Nations exist at all? He strongly condemned coupling terrorism with Islam  which represented peace  adding that those labelling their inhuman actions as Islamic disrespected Islam and all of humanity.  Turkey was approaching issues in its region on moral grounds  and not on the basis of religion or race  he said  noting that 1.5 million people had come to Turkey and were receiving food and medicine.  Unfortunately  however  the rest of the world was not supplying much support.  So far  Turkey had spent more than $4.5 billion on Syrian refugees; he wondered why only 130 000 were being served by European countries.  The Syrian crisis was a global one to which it was impossible to remain indifferent.  Turkey had always retained its objectivity regarding terrorism  sectarian conflicts and rights protection.  It fought terrorism itself.  It opposed anti-Semitism and all forms of racism  which were crimes against humanity.  So too was Islamophobia.  Turkey would fight for democracy and prosperity with heart and soul  he said  urging the world community’s support for its pursuit of a non-permanent seat on the Council.  EVO MORALES AYMA  President of Bolivia  said that Mother Earth was injured by an inhumane and predatory capitalism  which turned human life and nature into merchandize.  There was an opportunity today to build a new and better world.  A shared commitment by all was needed to change the vision of development to one that was more holistic  with people living in harmony with the Earth  and in solidarity and peace.  The world had lost its respect for Mother Earth  which was a dangerous development.  Encouraged by capitalism  people had turned everything into a market  including genetic manipulation and destruction of human beings.  Economic growth did not  in itself  lead to social well-being; societies could not be exclusionary or governed by the grasping nature of the market. He stressed the fundamental importance of recovering the control of natural resources in order to garner greater benefits for people and eliminate poverty.  It was vital to strike a balance between the rights of Mother Earth  the right to development  respect for the rights of indigenous peoples  social and economic rights  and the rights of the poor to emerge from poverty.  The human right to water was a fundamental priority  as in many regions the demand exceeded availability — a reality which would worsen as the years passed.  In 2050  4 billion people would suffer from scarcity of water in the context of climate change. With the national programme  My Water  Bolivia had reached the Millennium Development Goal on water  he said  declaring that human rights could not be privatized.  Water was life  and could not be the subject of profit or commerce.  To resolve major social inequalities  basic services  such as water  electricity  telecommunications  sanitation and basic health must be seen as human rights.  To eradicate poverty and hunger  the international community must fight the pitiless and inhumane forces of the market  and profoundly change the exclusionary structures of international financial institutions.  The world financial architecture must be reformed in order to eradicate financial colonialism. He said that war fed the darkest interests  such as the geopolitical control of private commerce.  Humanity could overcome many of its problems  such as Ebola and HIV  if funds were diverted from war.  Bolivia condemned the genocidal actions of Israel against Palestine  he said  urging recognition of Palestine as a full Member of the United Nations. Bolivia shared the belief that Syria’s future and destiny should be determined by Syrians themselves  and in that context  he condemned the United States’ interference in Iraq  which had triggered the current conflict there.  The war begun in 2003 had destabilized the entire region.  The argument that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction was the biggest lie of the imperialist era and had ultimately resulted in the creation of the “Islamic State” terrorist group.  He rejected those actions  adding that nothing justified fratricidal violence.  Wherever the United States intervened  it left misery  hate and death in its trail  but also left wealth in the hands of the arms and oil industries.  A culture of peace required the eradication of extremist fanaticism  as well as the warmongering promoted by the United States. Waging war on war did not result in peace  he said  adding that every year  President Obama shared a discourse of arrogance and threats to the peoples of the world; that was also a discourse of extremist fanaticism.  The blockade against Cuba amounted to genocide  and must come to an end immediately.  Bolivia’s sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean must be settled through international law.  That would transform the century to one of peace  liberty and life.  There would be no peace  so long as arrogant empires harassed and killed the peoples and cultures of the world.  The empires of finance  markets and of the arms industry must give way to the wisdom of life  peace and harmony. DANILO MEDINA SÁNCHEZ  President of the Dominican Republic  said that the crisis begun in the industrialized countries six years ago had spread throughout the world  placing the welfare State  which had produced some of the greatest progress in history  in jeopardy.  Social justice was being endangered in the countries of its origins  yet it was starting to thrive in emerging countries. The Dominican Republic had set itself the goal of becoming a people-centred developed country  he said  spotlighting education as a priority in that process  and noting programmes were in place to ensure that all girls and boys had access.  Shortly  the country expected to be free of illiteracy.  The welfare State was creating improvements in health and in supporting small agricultural producers  and there was a renaissance of the Dominican countryside  enabling it to feed the country.  Poverty had been reduced by 6 per cent  and in rural areas by 9 per cent. Turning to other parts of the world  he said that today’s numerous conflicts were the result of holding on to past grievances.  There would always be those who wanted to keep those alive  without any compunction about causing people harm.  There were others who looked to the future and a world they would like to create for their children.  In that regard  an historic agreement had been reached between the Dominican Republic and its neighbour on the island  Haiti. The two had a history of past conflicts  but “our history is extremely rich”  and there were positive aspects to be found when the search continued to find ways to improve people’s lives.  Together  they were discovering that old wounds did prevent advancing along that path.  In fact  taking those steps helped to close past wounds. He urged the international community to support the new era between Haiti and the Dominican Republic  by helping their people receive the documents they needed to establish their countries of origin.  That was also fundamental to providing them with social services.  “Please help Haiti document its people  both in its own territory and in the Dominican Republic ” he said  urging all not to allow “a few technical deficiencies to be an obstacle” to such a hopeful time for the two countries.  In closing  he said the economy was not a prison  but could be a tool used to improve people’s lives.  Finally  he called on Member States to make education and health care for all a fundamental human right. UHURU KENYATTA  President of Kenya  called for urgent  sustained attention to the devastating Ebola crisis in Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea.  Kenya stood in solidarity with those affected countries  and earlier this month  had given $1 million to the effort to bring the crisis under control; it stood ready to do more.  Last week  East African Health Ministers had met in Nairobi and agreed on steps to safeguard their populations and ensure the virus did not spread to the region.  The Government stood ready to resume Kenya Airways flights once appropriate measures were in place.  He welcomed creation of the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER)  stressing that the Ebola crisis underlined the need to build strong States in the region that could withstand and respond to emergencies.  “We must commit to build strong  resilient and accountable States that can effectively respond to shocks  adversities and emergencies in the future ” he said. Kenya had been at the forefront of driving the Assembly’s Open Working Group process to create the sustainable development goals  he went on  urging that the post-2015 development agenda address the cross-section of social  economic and environmental challenges  and be universal  comprehensive and responsive to all nations equally.  Kenya was at a critical moment; as it deepened democracy  it was thrust into the front line of a regional and global war against terror.  Without an effective buffer  Kenya and other countries would find it difficult to entrench democracy and the post-2015 development agenda.  He expressed particular concern over the perennially fragile state of affairs in the Greater Horn of Africa.  Kenya continued to sacrifice lives and resources to bring peace to neighbouring Somalia.  The international community must stay the course to consolidate peace  invest in stable institutions and promote democracy there. Kenya and other countries of the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD) had invested much to end the tragedy in South Sudan  but progress had been slow  he said.  “We cannot let this young nation down.  At this Assembly  I make a special plea for South Sudan  for no nation has  over the years  suffered as much neglect from the international community ” he said  also imploring the nations’ leaders to “demonstrate determined and enlightened leadership and to make peace without further delay”.  Africa’s outdated development model had run its course.  Future socioeconomic transformation would come from within the continent  aided by external ideas and resources.  For the post-2015 development agenda to be transformative  it must first embrace the primacy of developing countries. This year  Kenya had presided over the Conference of State Parties of People Living with Disabilities  the Forum on Forests and had co-chaired the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  he noted.  The country’s transformation agenda was grounded on Vision 2030  which  building on the 2010 Constitution  aimed to make the governance system more democratic  inclusive and responsive.  The Government had launched financial initiatives and training programmes for women and youth  and advanced children’s rights and welfare through universal immunization coverage and promoting breastfeeding during the first six months of an infant’s life.  It had provided fortified food and insecticide mosquito nets  along with free maternal health care and child care in Government hospitals.  Additionally  the “Beyond Zero” campaign was bolstering management of chronic preventable diseases. He said his country was on track to achieve the Millennium target for universal primary education  noting its implementation of a social protection cash transfer programme for orphans and vulnerable children  people with severe disabilities and the elderly  targeting 45 000 households.  To fight illicit wildlife trafficking  it had enacted laws and continued to work with other countries and organizations to enhance protection of fauna and flora.  Kenya also continued to work to achieve 10 per cent forest cover; it was well above global targets for renewable energy use and fully supported all steps agreed at the recent United Nations Environmental Assembly in Nairobi.  It was engaged in a range of activities to hasten East Africa’s integration  easing restrictions on cross-border trade.  It also continued to invest heavily to combat extremism and terrorism. LUIS GUILLERMO SOLÍS RIVERA  President of Costa Rica  said that the whirlwinds of oppression and violence  anxiety  desperation and systematic violations of human rights affected many corners of the world.  The international community was witness to an upsurge in violence and armed confrontation  as well as an increase in despicable crimes and extremism  together with ever-increasing numbers of people displaced  humanitarian crises and deplorable acts that went unpunished.  Costa Ricans were not indifferent to the terror of armed conflicts  and less still to the suffering of the millions victimized by its most abject manifestations.  Conflicts that tormented the world often emerged from fragile States and their institutions.  Also present were poverty  corruption and impunity  as well as serious human rights violations.  No conflict erupted as without warning  as all showed clear signs of unrest.  In some cases  the threat was identified but no action was taken due to lack of consensus  such as in Syria.  Or  the danger was not acknowledged in time  such as in South Sudan. He said that all States should resolve their international conflicts peacefully  in compliance with the United Nations Charter and in strict accordance with international laws and agreements.  Peace could not take root where there was impunity  and when war crimes  genocide and crimes against humanity were committed  those responsible must be investigated and tried  ultimately by the International Criminal Court  when national justice proved insufficient. Maintaining international peace and security also required strengthening the Security Council  he said  stressing his country’s objection to the use of the veto for obstructing measures that sought to avoid resolution of conflicts.  Costa Ricans were amazed at the way some permanent members of the Council cited support for sovereignty in blocking the Council’s intervention at a moment when it should have been acting to prevent rivers from turning red with blood — the blood of innocent victims.  Silence was not an option  he said  condemning the indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas and its use of human shields.  He also condemned Israel’s use of disproportionate force.  He demanded respect for the Gaza ceasefire along with negotiation of a permanent solution. He repudiated the transfer of conventional weapons into existing conflict zones  he said  also deploring the use of explosive weapons in densely populated areas of Syria  Gaza and east Ukraine.  He called on States to urgently develop stricter rules and commitments to prohibit and restrict those weapons’ use.  He also condemned the use of cluster munitions  and rejected the development and possession of nuclear weapons. Touching on other matters of concern  he said there could be no peace without sustainable development  or as long as there was poverty.  Further  the world now faced the most serious threat in the history of mankind — climate change — a threat to the very survival of the species.  He  thus  demanded robust actions by those countries that contributed the most to global warming.  In closing  he stressed that hope must prevail:  in times of fear  there should be assurance; in times of conflict  peace.  At times of rejection and prejudice from others  a kind and welcoming embrace between fellow human beings.  At times of death  life.   ELBEGDORJ TSAKHIA  President of Mongolia  said that ISIL posed an alarming threat to regional peace and security  and he called for action to resolve that issue in compliance with the United Nations Charter.  He also stressed that the situation in Ukraine should be resolved through political dialogue only  and not the use of force. He noted Mongolia was currently chairing the Freedom Online Coalition  and expressed the country’s support for the decision of the United Nations Human Rights Council that Internet freedom was a basic human right.  As a staunch advocate of democracy and freedom  Mongolia would use the opportunity of chairing the Coalition to promote  both nationally and internationally  free and secure Internet for all.  Touching on other areas of interest to his country  he highlighted climate change as an urgent priority  and in the lead-up to “COP21” in Paris next year  called for bold action and strong political will to ensure that State pledges were translated into action.  He welcomed the outcome of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  but said it could have better reflected the special needs of landlocked developing countries  and he looked forward to the upcoming intergovernmental negotiations to redress that situation. Regarding the recent Mongolia  China and Russian Federation summit  he said that the countries had agreed to expand their cooperation in the areas of transportation  infrastructure  development and reduction of trade barriers.  He also highlighted peace and stability in North-Eastern Asia as one of Mongolia’s national security priorities  expressing his view that the Korean peninsula must be nuclear weapon-free.  On organizational reform  he said that in a time of major geopolitical change  the United Nations system must reflect new economic and political realities.  The reform process  therefore  must be accelerated  including the “long-overdue” expansion of the Security Council’s permanent and non-permanent membership.  On that note  Mongolia had put forward its candidature for a non-permanent seat for the 2022 elections  and was seeking the support of fellow members. GOODLUCK JONATHAN  President of Nigeria  stressed that the post-2015 agenda requires collective ownership and should meet the aspirations of developing countries.  Noting that his country was co-chair of the report on sustainable development by the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts  he said that Nigeria would strengthen governance and institutions to ensure the efficiency of resources and create an “enabling environment for rapid development”. However  he said  the consequences of terrorism were “extremely agonizing”.  From Al Qaida in the Maghreb and Al Shaabab in Somalia  to Boko Haram in Nigeria and the newly emerging “Islamic State”  foreign fighters had remained a common feature.  The destructive ideology of those groups was a major challenge that must be collectively halted.  The current tools of peacekeeping operations needed to be reviewed  he said  recalling the activities of Boko Haram in Nigeria and its repeated assassinations  bombings and kidnappings  as well as the large-scale abduction of school girls in the north-east of the country.  He thanked all countries and organizations for their continued support and assured the Assembly that his country was working “assiduously” to free the girls. Turning to Security Council reform  he stressed that today’s challenges could only be resolved by a Council whose working methods promoted transparency  inclusivity and common ownership through equitable representation of all regions.  That process should be fast-tracked and would require the collective resolve of all Member States to ensure that 2015 — the fiftieth anniversary of the last significant reform — would bring about decisive progress. As the African continent battled conflicts and terrorism  the region had also been devastated by the outbreak of Ebola  he continued.  With the help of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other international partners  Nigeria had been able to control the disease’s spread.  The situation in Liberia and Sierra Leone  however  required collective global action.  Nigeria had donated $3.5 million and had provided training and capacity-building to support the three affected countries.  He urged the international community to avoid “indulging in isolationist and discriminatory tendencies” that would worsen an already critical situation. Highlighting the role of the United Nations in finding solutions to all of those challenges  he reiterated his country’s commitment as a partner in working collectively to tackle new and emerging threats to global peace and security. PAUL KAGAME  President of Rwanda  said the success of the Millennium Development Goals framework illustrated the ongoing strength of international cooperation.  If the public and private sectors worked together on climate change  the world could look forward to a future where countries did not have to choose between clean energy and economic growth.  Efforts to address crises in Africa and the Middle East had not been effective  he said  adding that two important goods had been consistently undervalued in that regard — physical security and national identity — which were vital to sustainable nation-building and peace.  Without them  sustainable gains in good governance suffered.  It took time to create change; there were no short-cuts.  The voices and concerns of all citizens must be included in the process of consensus-building  as structures that did not come from within would not take root.  Member States must heed those realities. To manage diversity in societies  politics must be international in scope  he said  adding that negative experiences of nationalism had created doubt about patriotism and national identity.  Today  it was evident that national identities were too weak.  Regionalism and religions had become the dominant forces  tearing nations apart.  In Rwanda  the focus had been on building Government institutions that were held to account and on renewing the dignity of the nation.  As a result  Rwandans were the most optimistic people in the world  with faith in their Government and institutions.  It was up to the international community to not just manage conflicts  but to help prevent and end them. JUAN ORLANDO HERNÁNDEZ ALVARADO  President of Honduras  said the nation’s “Everyone for a Better Life” plan was based on four pillars:  recovering peace; creating investment opportunities for very poor families; combating corruption; and promoting transparency.  Since taking office eight months ago  he had worked to instil peace and create more just conditions for all.  More investment in the country was needed to create better-paying jobs.  Honduras had reformed its Constitution to create employment and economic development zones known as “ZEDE”  with special legal  economic  administrative and political jurisdictions.  The zones could improve competitiveness and well-being.  They were governed by a common law system with international arbitration and judges  and offered a technical  non-political structure for companies and guaranteed transparency and political stability for investors. He said the Government was setting up a logistical inter-oceanic corridor to move cargo between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in less than six hours  and hoped to capture at least 5 per cent of cargo traffic demand.  He  meanwhile  called for special attention to the growing number of unaccompanied children migrating to the United States due to violence  drug trafficking and their parents’ lack of economic opportunities at home.  Staunching those flows was a shared responsibility  he said  declaring that Honduras was merely a transit territory for a war created by drug-consuming countries in the North and drug-producing countries in the South.  The time had come to finally attack the root causes of the drug problem.  “We must create a multinational force capable of successfully confronting this transnational phenomenon ” he said. There was much talk of families displaced by war  violence and extreme radicalism in other regions  but little mention of the situation faced by thousands of families in the northern part of Central America  he said.  “What is the difference between people displaced by violence in other regions and those displaced by violence generated by drug traffickers and transnational crime?”  he asked.  The region could not continue to ignore that human drama affecting thousands of Central Americans  particularly child migrants who were victims of violence  rape  and human and organ trafficking. Noting that many children had died in the desert  he said “these children deserved to be treated with dignity and respect; they are innocent victims”.  Yesterday  he had handed the Secretary-General the “Alliance for Prosperity” plan  which provided a blueprint for support and opportunities for Central Americans everywhere.  Generating work opportunities for the parents of child migrants was vital.  Elaborating on the “Everyone for a Better Life” programme  he said it was designed to bring potable water  basic sanitation  housing and children’s school fees and health care to 835 000 Honduran households in need.  To address climate change  energy-efficient stoves had replaced thousands of wood-burning stoves in Honduras.  The latter appliances caused 37 000 deaths in the country annually  he said  adding that each energy-efficient stove saved 15 mid-sized trees each year. FILIP VUJANOVIĆ  President of Montenegro  said that he was committed to an effective multilateral system resting on a strong United Nations based on an integrated functional system that enabled respect for human rights  promotion of democracy  and the rule of law  and was able to devise and implement global responses to global challenges.  In that regard  he expressed support for the reform process known as “System-wide Coherence” and the integrated programme of action called “Delivering as One”. He noted that the United Nations Eco building had opened in the capital of Montenegro in March  hosting all the Organization’s specialized agencies  and offering them optimum conditions to deliver as one. As a member of the Human Rights Council  he expressed support for the integration of a human rights dimension in all the Organization’s work  and hoped to strengthen the Council’s role in response to human rights violations.  The key priority was to promote the rights of vulnerable groups.  Further  noting that peace and stability were preconditions for development  he expressed support for global disarmament efforts  and noted that Montenegro this year had become the forty-fourth country to have ratified the Arms Trade Treaty. He said that open and frozen conflicts  from Ukraine through the Middle East and Africa  threatened global stability and caused humanitarian disasters and massive human rights violations.  He advocated for an urgent end to violence and greater reliance on political dialogue that led to solutions in line with international law  the Charter and relevant resolutions.  He also called for  greater use of preventive measures under the Charter’s Chapter VI  and reaffirmed Montenegro’s commitment to the responsibility to protect. He also underscored the importance of the rule of law and protection of civilians in peacekeeping missions.  The post-2015 development agenda must be based on respect for those rights to ensure that  in development processes  no one was neglected.  Poverty eradication and sustainable prosperity for the benefit of all people and the planet must be the overarching objective in the design of the next agenda. JACOB ZUMA  President of South Africa  welcomed the theme of this year’s general debate “Delivering on and Implementing the Post-2015 Development Agenda’. Africa had made significant progress since it had implemented the Millennium Development Goals 14 years ago  and in that period  it had seized the opportunity to adopt the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)  the continent’s “socio-development blueprint”.  Together with NEPAD and other such development programmes  the African Union’s vision for 2063 will be the cornerstone and foundation of Africa’s future development agenda. South Africa had made significant progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals  he said  noting that the number of people earning less than a dollar a day had been halved  as had as those experiencing hunger.  His country had also attained Goal 2 — primary education for all — and was on its way to achieving Goal 3 — promoting and empowering women.  Progress had been achieved through the expansion of health infrastructure and improved access to health services for all South Africans.  Despite that  reports continued to show that the continent was lagging behind.  For that reason  the post-2015 agenda must carry forward the “unfinished business of the [Millennium Development Goals]”.  He called on developing countries to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national income towards ODA. Putting aside everything that the United Nations had achieved in the past six decades  he said if we do not deal with the scourge of poverty  underdevelopment and diseases  “the poor of the world will consider everything to have been a failure”.  The outbreak of Ebola in West Africa was a clear example of the persistent challenges for developing countries.  The outbreak had exposed constraints in capacity  infrastructure and other limited resources in Africa.  Still  he praised the leadership of Secretary-General in deploying a mission to coordinate efforts to combat the virus and affirmed that South Africa stood ready to provide resources at its disposal to assist the affected countries.  More  however  were should be deployed to ensure the containment of the virus. He voiced South Africa’s support for the quest for freedom and self-determination  including by the peoples of Palestine and Western Sahara  who continued to experience occupation in different forms.  Further  his country supported Cuba’s struggle for economic liberation because of its sacrifice for African freedom.  The Israeli-Palestine question was one of the oldest items on the United Nations agenda  and yet it remained elusive.  As there could be no military solution  the international community must remain committed to a two-State solution based on the 1967 borders and a peaceful coexistence with Israel. DIDIER BURKHALTER  President of Switzerland  echoed the words of Swiss youth activist Damian Vogt and girls’ education crusader Malala Yusufzai as he urged the international community to meet the aspirations of today’s youth.  Like millions of other young people around the globe  they wanted exactly the same things:  peace  human dignity  freedom and equality  and education  and an opportunity to work  he said.  The United Nations must do everything in its power to give them a world where humanity was synonymous with security  freedom and prosperity.  International security and United Nations reform was two priority areas and would enable the Organization to stay true to its roots as “an assembly of States at the service of the people borne out of the ruins of conflict”.  Today’s security challenges were immense.  Around the world  the rule of law and principles of humanitarian law had been flouted.  Particularly worrisome were the developments in the Middle East  most notably the brutal acts of the “Islamic State” in Syria and Iraq. It was for that reason  he said  that nations must be united in the “supremacy of law over force”. When serious violations occurred  investigations must be carried out.  Along with 60 other States  Switzerland had requested that the Security Council refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.  At the same time  the root causes of extremism must be addressed.  Switzerland had established the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund to provide support for projects that would strengthen education and civic engagement  and build capacity at the community level to provide alternatives to extremism. He said the situation in Ukraine “weakens the security of the entire continent”.  Violations of international law in Crimea demanded a firm response by the international community  but one that was balanced and left room for dialogue and cooperation.  To simply isolate Russia from the rest of Europe would not solve any problems.  Stability could only be restored by working with the country  not against it.  His country  in its capacity as Chair of OSCE  fully supported the contact group for Ukraine and Russia  and would take steps to increase funding for a civil monitoring mission in cooperation with the United Nations.  Nations could make the greatest contribution to global security through conflict prevention  he said. The secret to stability and the heart of Switzerland’s history lay in a willingness to share power  engage in direct dialogue with minorities and distribute authority between central and local government.  There must be an “emphasis on consultation rather than confrontation”.  To manage global tensions  it was essential to strengthen the mediation capacities of both the United Nations and of regional security organizations.  Wars could grow out of missed opportunities for dialogue  he warned.  In the coming year  Switzerland would augment its contribution to global development and humanitarian cooperation through roughly 0.5 per cent of its national income. In closing  he said the post-2015 process was a unique opportunity to transform the world’s challenges into opportunities  however  certain crises could not await the outcome of discussions.  Thus  Switzerland had decided to increase its humanitarian commitment in the fight against Ebola.  Already  Swiss-based research centres  some of the best in the world  were working with WHO in the clinical testing of vaccines. IDRISS DEBY ITNO  President of Chad  said that development through attempts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals had not produced the expected results from many States.  Among the main causes for that shortfall included weakness of solidarity in financing those goals and not adapting them to the concerns and realities of Africa.  Setbacks were also due to the many global crises that arose  such as the financial  food  environmental and security crises. Unfortunately  on the eve of the important post-2015 meeting  the same security risks remained  he said.  Armed conflicts and terrorism were becoming constant threats in many areas in Africa  aggravated by migration that deprived Africa of its strong working people.  It was necessary then to join efforts to respond to those challenges which were dangerously compromising the future of the continent. African countries needed to take on their own security by implementing laws that ensured security at the national  regional and continental levels  he continued.  The countries of the Sahel  namely Burkina Faso  Mali  Mauritania  Niger and Chad  were mobilized through the Sahel “G5” Group to build a strong system of good governance  security and peace.  The security of one country or region was linked to the development of its neighbours  and thus  of the entire continent. There was a regional and continental will to respond to terrorism  which was progressively gaining ground in Africa  he said  calling on the countries of the Lake Chad mission to bring the joint multinational force into action to combat Boko Haram.  His country continued to contribute to peace and reconciliation in Africa  and among others  welcomed the holding of the Brazzaville Forum on reconciliation and inclusive dialogue between central African brothers. Chad would continue to support the processes of dialogue and reconciliation throughout Africa  he said.  Regarding the new Libya  which had barely begun to exist after the fall of Qadhafi’s regime  the violence had doubled in intensity and populations lived in constant fear.  However  Libyans must resolutely commit to a political resolution process  which was the only proper path to ensure peace  unity and territorial integrity for Libya.  Chad  as well as Nigeria  Sudan and the Central African Republic  had welcomed hundreds of thousands of refugees who had fled armed conflicts or terrorist threats.  There were more than 500 000 refugees from neighbouring countries in Chad  including many repatriated Chadians and displaced Chadians. Regarding the Ebola virus  he said the international community must act quickly  as the disease knew no borders.  He went on to reiterate that peace  stability and development were intrinsically linked.  However  those universal principles were not often respected  especially by the Powers of the world.  Such was the case with the International Criminal Court  which seemed to practise double standards and only pursued the weak:  80 per cent of those pursued were Africans. He concluded  underscoring that Chad would continue to work to consolidate the rule of law and good governance through reform of its institutions  creating jobs for youth  and combating poverty and food insecurity. TOOMAS HENDRIK ILVES  President of Estonia  reminded the Assembly that it had collectively agreed  in the Charter  and other international agreements  to respect territorial integrity and to recognize the freedom of States to choose their own security arrangements.  By annexing Crimea and invading eastern Ukraine  one of the signatories had violated those agreements.  If changing State borders by force would become the accepted norm  the whole world would be threatened.  Such developments must be firmly condemned. The paralysis of the Security Council  while international justice was being manipulated and multiple crises were escalating  demonstrated that it must be reformed  he said.  Its work methods must be revised  with special attention to openness  accountability and transparency.  No permanent member of the Council should abuse the veto to circumvent the principles of the Charter. Pointing out the universality and inviolability of human rights  he said there could be no guarantee of peace  justice  stability or security unless the basic rights of all human beings were respected and protected in every country.  Emphasizing the need for free speech  including online  he said that the internet was a driver of economic growth and a key development tool.  Most of the next billion Internet users would be from developing countries.  The post-2015 development agenda should recognize the importance of new technologies and e-services as a contribution to the security and prosperity of the world.  However  cyber security was essential both to protecting rights and to economic prosperity. Addressing a series of related challenges  he noted that Ebola had become an international public health emergency  that climate change was becoming an existential threat to some countries and that those and the risks of violence  insecurity  financial and economic collapse  lack of resources and natural disasters were intertwined and needed to be addressed in an integrated way.  Peace and sustainable development required respect for human rights  which presumed the rule of law at the national and international level.  In that regard  he said that Estonia had developed an e-governance system that it had been sharing with all interested parties. He recalled that long discredited ideas from 1938  of co-ethnics abroad being used as justification to annex territory  had returned.  “We cannot allow anyone ever again to divide countries into their “spheres of influence”. “The community of nations is only secure when its smallest members can feel secure.  […]  A way must be found to re-enforce and revalidate the agreements that we all have signed ” he stated TEODORO OBIANG NGUEMA MBASOGO  President of Equatorial Guinea  said that the General Assembly bore the heavy responsibility of finding solutions to the problems of poverty  hunger  violence  piracy and terrorist activity  as well as Ebola  which was now laying waste to some countries in Africa.  Because of that disease’s deadly effects  his Government had announced a donation of $2 million to the WHO to finance programmes to combat it. However  the United Nations would not be able to find solutions to those difficult problems unless the role of the General Assembly was strengthened and revitalized  he said.  That role had recently become routine.  Furthermore  the United Nations would not be able to find lasting solutions if the Security Council could not be governed by rules that respected international justice.  The proliferation interventions that did not respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States was of great concern.  Those interventions interrupted the process of democracy in those affected countries  further fuelling divisions and socio-political instability.  It was important to clearly distinguish between supporting a democratic process and interference through pressures  which led to intolerance  exclusions and hatred among citizens. Democracy was not an imported product  he said  and could not be designed in the offices of other countries.  Democracy was formed through the application of positive values characterizing a society  and only the people were able to define the model that best suited them.  Equatorial Guinea was being made into a modern democratic State  in which politics were now at their peak.  The transfer of power was guaranteed through equal rights for all political options  the administration of public affairs was carried out with transparency  and human rights were monitored by reliable institutions. His Government had taken economic initiatives to develop its natural resources  and aimed to place itself as an economically emerging country by 2020  he said.  He thanked the United States  China  Cuba  France  Brazil  the Russian Federation and Morocco for their assistance.  Wishing the sixty-ninth session every success  he voiced hope to see the United Nations recover its leading role in delivering peace  security and global development. MAHINDA RAJAPAKSA  President of Sri Lanka  noting progress made towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals  said that multiple challenges still remained.  Pointing out that reducing inequality within and among countries was one of the most transformative goals proposed by the Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  he expressed hope that that would enhance the voice and representation of developing countries in decision-making.  The post-2015 agenda must focus on implementation  ensuring that the failure of the developed countries to fulfil Millennium Goal 8 for a global partnership would not be repeated. Countries must be able to set their own domestic priorities  he said  backed by strengthened partnerships that would allow countries of the South to access financial and technological resources essential to capacity-building.  Structural obstacles and political barriers  such as unfair trade practices and investment rules  must be addressed to create a supportive international economic environment  enhanced investment flows and an open multilateral trading regime. The United Nations role in advancing international peace  security and prosperity was crucial to the contemporary world  he said  stressing the need for consistent standards to gain the confidence of the entire international community.  Post-conflict Sri Lanka had fallen victim to the ill-conceived agendas of some in the Human Rights Council  who disregarded progress made by his country  in contrast to their response to disturbing humanitarian emergencies elsewhere.  The Organization’s systems and mechanisms must be de-politicized  he said  urging concrete results on Security Council reform in 2015. Noting with distress the increasing violence in the Middle East  he expressed support for an independent  viable State of Palestine.  He also pointed out the need for solidarity between Asia and Africa  stating that Sri Lanka was reaching out to countries in Africa to exchange knowledge and expertise.  He urged the international community to support the eradication of deadly diseases in the continent.  Concerning terrorism  he affirmed his support for all multilateral efforts to counter it  and looked to the early finalization and adoption of the United Nations comprehensive convention on international terrorism. Despite the effects of terrorism  he noted that Sri Lanka had achieved most of the Millennium Development Goals and was ranked ahead of all South Asian countries in the 2013 Human Development Index.  The National Development Policy was rural-centric and had resulted in 7.8 per cent growth in GDP and per capita income of $3 280 in 2013.  The country’s “IT” literacy had also grown steadily.  Large-scale post-conflict reconstruction was under way with rehabilitation and resettlement initiatives implemented in the North.  Importantly  elections had been held to the Northern Provincial Council after a lapse of 28 years  upholding the democratic tradition in Sri Lanka  which had been protected since independence. NICOLÁS MADURO MOROS  President of Venezuela  thanking the United Nations for the tributes paid to the late president of his country  Hugo Chávez  noted that the Charter was really one of the most beautiful poems that the world could ever read  but it had become an instrument that was unfortunately set aside  overlooked and consistently flouted. He stressed that the United Nations was an historic experiment and that only with its establishment had humanity begin to see the light of the future at the end of a long tunnel of wars  battles and global conflicts.  Given the importance of having such an institution  the international community must stress the need for an in-depth transformation.  It was necessary to revamp the leadership of the Security Council.  The Organization now had to deal with a multi-polar world with emerging countries and regions  each with their own faults.  There was also a need to adapt and submit to the broader sovereignty of the peoples of the world who wished to be heard  and to strengthen the strength and clout of the Secretary-General so that he could find solutions to the conflicts of the world. Observing the emergence of a new regionalism  he pointed to the Bolivarian Alliance  which was observing its tenth anniversary.  Petrocaribe  the oil alliance  supported that southern regionalism and was now starting to form ties with the rest of the world.  There was optimism for the new regionalism  and new forms were arising towards establishing a new road map for rethinking and overhauling the United Nations.  That momentum must not fall through the cracks.  A common road map for humanity was needed if the international community wished to tackle the important issues that it faced.  He asked when President Obama would take the opportunity to go down in history by ending the embargo in Cuba. In addition  the General Assembly needed to draft a document that would become a mandatory text for the United Nations to defend poor countries against the “vulture funds” that sought to plunder those countries’ economies and impose detrimental economic systems.  He expressed solidarity with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) countries  and Argentina in particular. He also stressed the need for a decolonization plan for Puerto Rico  which was part of the Caribbean community and should be a part of CELAC.  Oscar Lopez  whose only offense was to defend Puerto Rico  had been in a United States prison for almost 35 years and had been tortured.  Calling for Mr. Lopez’s immediate release  he compared him to Nelson Mandela. Venezuela had the largest oil reserves in the hemisphere  he went on to say.  For the first time in 90 years  the country had fully recovered its own oil resources for the basis of its own development  after facing the persecution of imperialist forces.  The imperialist Powers could not succeed with Hugo Chávez  and they would not succeed with him. The loss of human lives should pain the whole world  he said.  Because bombs killed the innocents  there was no other way to overthrow the terrorist networks of the world  but to invite the Governments of the region to come up with a comprehensive strategy that could be supported by the Security Council.  Anything else was “crazy”  he said.  Current methods  such as was done in Libya  were a “crazy race towards more terrorism and more violence”. DAVID CAMERON  Prime Minister of the United Kingdom  took note of the extraordinary “tests of our values and our resolve”  in Ukraine  in the Middle East and in dealing with the Ebola outbreak  but primarily  the threat from ISIL.  That problem was not restricted to just one region  but affected all and must be tackled together.  Past mistakes were no excuse for indifference or inaction  he said  recognizing that not a single person in the Hall would view the challenge without reference to the past  whether in Iraq or Afghanistan.  Lessons must be learned from the past  especially from what had happened in Iraq 10 years ago  but the right lessons must be learned  namely to act  but to act differently. Defeating Islamist extremism  he continued  required a comprehensive plan.  The problem had nothing to do with Islam  which was a peaceful religion that inspired countless acts of generosity  he said.  To defeat the extremist ideology  however  all its forms  including incitement to hatred and intolerance  must be addressed.  Muslims and their Governments worldwide must reclaim their religion  and young people needed programmes that would channel them away from poisonous dialogues.  To that end  he called for a new Special Representative on extremism at the United Nations.  The world community should also be intelligent  supporting accountable Governments and showing young people other ways of reaching their aspirations.  He called for the widest-possible coalition of countries in the region and around the world  including Iran  to be involved in that global effort to defeat extremism.  “And we should be uncompromising — using all the means at our disposal  including military force  to hunt down these extremists.” His delegation  he said  had tabled a resolution in the Security Council to disrupt financial flows to ISIL  to sanction those seeking to recruit to ISIL and to encourage countries to do everything possible to prevent foreign fighters from joining the extremist cause.  Regarding the military  he said he did not think the threat would be best solved by Western ground troops directly trying to pacify or reconstruct Middle Eastern or African countries.  However  the military could support humanitarian efforts.  He urged that more be done to build the capability of legitimate authorities fighting extremists  whether by training equipping and advising  as well as providing technology and other assets necessary for success.  “We are facing an evil against which the whole world must unite ” he said. HELLE THORNING-SCHMIDT  Prime Minister of Denmark  condemned the situation unfolding in Syria and Iraq and the heinous acts of ISIL  including the lack of respect for international borders and the persecution of people based on their religious beliefs.  That contravenes the laws and norms upon which our international system and laws are built.  Strong global action was needed to manage today’s conflicts  yet there were no simple solutions  she said. As the world changed  new ways must be found to adapt  for which actions must be united.  The United Nations’ strength rested in a unified international community  and all must fulfil their Charter-based obligations. She identified three issues that her country had deemed urgent for the United Nations to address:  developing stronger international cooperation on peace and security; reaching a climate change agreement at the upcoming summit in Paris; and reaching global consensus on the post-2015 development agenda.  In the area of international security  confronting ISIL should be a top priority  she said  condemning ISIL’s violence and extremist ideology.  Denmark had supported the Iraqis and the victims of its atrocities  and the international community in the effort to defeat that terror group.  The root causes of the crises must be confronted.  Bringing an end to the violence in the region required a sustained contribution from all  she urged. The global response to the chemical weapons threat in Syria last year had highlighted the potential of a united international community  she said  adding that a unified response was also required to deal with the Ebola crisis.  Failing to tackle that would not only result in a global health crisis  but would pose a major threat to international peace and security.  There was a collective responsibility to control the outbreak.  For its part  Denmark had contributed significant funds to combat the crisis and would continue to provide material support.  Included in that would be maritime capacity  she announced. On the subject of climate change  she stressed the importance of reaching a binding agreement at the Paris conference later this year that would reduce CO2 emissions.  She had been to Greenland with the Secretary-General and seen the visible effects of climate change in the Arctic.  However  climate change would not just have regional impact  but would “affect every one of us on this planet”.  This year  Denmark would commit $100 million on that front  however Governments could not act alone.  Partnerships  including those with the private sector  were needed to foster green solutions.  The post-2015 agenda was also of critical importance in the effort could “wipe poverty off the face of the earth”.  That was not based on wishful thinking  but was within our reach  she said.  The new set of development goals must address a broad range of metrics.  Particularly critical to developing countries were women’s empowerment  gender equality and reproductive and other rights of women and girls. ARSENIY YATSENYUK  Prime Minister of Ukraine  stating that peace and stability did not exist in the world today  said that his country knew what terrorism was; not in words  but in practice.  The conflict in Ukraine was not domestic.  Ukraine had differences as every country did and it was ready to tackle its differences.  But  the origin of the conflict was an invasion by the Russian Federation.  “A ‘P5’ member violated the United Nations Charter.  That was “absolutely and entirely unacceptable”  he said. Twenty years ago  he went on to say  Ukraine had abandoned its nuclear arsenal  the third largest in the world at the time.  In return  it was guaranteed territorial integrity and sovereignty.  The Russian Federation signed the memorandum to that effect; yet  it’d broken that promise.  “We are committed to our nuclear non-proliferation programme  but we need guarantees of territorial integrity  security and independence ” he said. Pointing to the Russian Federation’s annexation of Crimea a few months ago  he commended Member States that supported the United Nations resolution on Ukraine’s territorial integrity and condemned the Russian Federation’s actions.  Today  Russian troops were deployed in eastern Ukraine and that Government had violated several multilateral and bilateral agreements.  He urged the Russian Federation to pull out its forces and to start real talks.  “We are the country that needs peace.  It’s difficult to hammer out any kind of peace deal at the barrel of a gun made in Russia ” he said. He mourned the victims of the Malaysian Airliner downed a few months ago  and urged everyone to help Ukraine bring to justice those responsible for “this despicable crime against humanity”.  Every day  despite the ceasefire  Ukraine was losing soldiers and civilians.  His country needed peace.  The military option was not the best option  he said  calling for a comprehensive diplomatic and political solution.  Sanctions were the way to start real talks and hammer out a peace deal.  “We have no trust in words.  We trust only deeds and actions ” he said. He reiterated Ukraine’s commitment to restore law and order and urged the Russian Federation to stick to its international obligations.  The Russian Federation had to execute all 12 points of the Memorandum of Understanding.  He asked Member States not to lift sanctions until the Russian Federation fully withdrew from eastern Ukraine  including Crimea.  “Mr. Putin  you can win the fight against the troops.  But  you will never win the fight against the nation  the united Ukrainian nation.  Help us God ” he said. RASHID MEREDOV  Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan  reiterated his country’s support for United Nations peacekeeping and stressed the need to strengthen regional interaction mechanisms.  In Central Asia  such mechanisms should ensure favourable conditions for maintaining lasting peace and stability  and combating terrorism  organized crime and drug trafficking.  He proposed holding a forum on security and cooperation in Central Asia under United Nations’ auspices in the Turkmen capital next year.  He called for greater interaction between the Turkmenistan-based United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy in Central Asia and OSCE  European Union and other international organizations. It was vital to support reconciliation in Afghanistan  which was essential for regional peace and security  he said.  Turkmenistan had hosted broad-based dialogue among Afghanistan’s various political parties  under United Nations’ auspices  as well as helped Afghanistan implement major transport and energy projects.  Construction of a gas pipeline running through Turkmenistan  Pakistan and India was in the final stages  he reported  adding that  last year  construction began on a railway between Turkmenistan  Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Steps were under way to implement the treaty to set up a nuclear-free zone in Central Asia  he noted  adding that his country stood ready to engage in constructive cooperation with the United Nations on disarmament.  In that vein  he suggested the creation of a subregional disarmament centre in Central Asia.  Stressing the importance of reliable and stable energy in the region  and its role in development  he said Turkmenistan would host the first meeting of global experts on that subject.  Earlier this month  it had hosted a high-level conference on transport and transit corridors.  The Ashgabat Declaration set the foundation for long-term practical interaction to develop transport and communications partnerships  he added. He stressed support for the decisions made at the climate change summits in Copenhagen  Cancun  Durban and Rio.  His Government had launched several concrete initiatives to enhance regional and global interaction in that sphere  including creation of a United Nations Regional Centre for Climate Change Technologies  to be based in Turkmenistan.  He urged the United Nations to support its establishment.  In June  the Turkmen Government  the International Organization for Migration and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had organized an international conference on migration and statelessness.  His Government would strive to translate into action the main points of the conference’s declaration  which called for better multilateral cooperation  as well as legal  social and material support for migrants. Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-09-23,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11558.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Sixty-ninth General Assembly Plenary 5th Meeting (PM)   The action-oriented provisions of the Outcome Document of the first World Conference on Indigenous Peoples  adopted yesterday  would lead to sweeping changes for current and future generations  participants heard at the closing of the two-day summit. “Let me further echo this call to action ” said General Assembly Vice-President Laurie Phipps (United States)  urging Member States  the United Nations system  civil society and the private sector to “do your part to keep the momentum of our discussions moving forward in a positive and productive manner”. The Document  she said  represented a balance between indigenous peoples’ concerns and what Member States could agree upon and would serve as a blueprint for the future  building on the commitments set forth in the Declaration on the Rights of the Indigenous Peoples.  She said the Outcome text was unique because of the inclusive way in which indigenous peoples and Member States were turning their shared goals into reality. The document also focused on the rights of indigenous women and addressed the intractable problem of violence against women  while speaking to the challenges faced by indigenous youth  the difficulty in sustaining indigenous languages  the need to preserve traditional knowledge and the requirement to ensure sustainable livelihoods.  Those issues formed the core of the broad  integrated agenda called for by indigenous peoples over the last two decades. Jan Eliasson  United Nations Deputy Secretary-General  said the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was the foundation and a guiding star  while the Outcome Document was an inspiration and the path forward.  Working together  indigenous peoples and Member States had identified important priorities and necessary actions on land  resources  justice systems  education  health and development. However  globally  indigenous peoples continued to lag behind others on education  health  employment and even life expectancy  he said.  The United Nations was currently identifying its global development priorities beyond 2015  and it was essential to make indigenous peoples’ issues a part of that new agenda.  The desired future would value and preserve diversity  and required a more equitable and sustainable use of the world’s resources. “Nobody can do everything  but everybody can do something ” he said  going on to explain that the United Nations was a reflection of two realities — a reflection of the world as it was  which was “not a pretty place”  with conflicts  inequalities  poverty  violence and violations of human rights.  However  the Organization was also a reflection of the world as it should be  and the job at hand was to diminish the gap between them.  It might not be bridged entirely  but it could be diminished  even if just by an inch  he said. Round-Table Discussion III Following the two round tables held yesterday (see Press Release GA/11554)  a third was convened this afternoon  co-chaired by Pita Sharples  Minister of Maori Affairs of New Zealand and Joan Carling  representative of the Asia Indigenous Region. Delivering opening remarks  Mr. SHARPLES said that as with many indigenous peoples  the Maori had a history of colonization that resulted in a significant loss of traditional lands  which affected their ability to access traditional resources.  Their struggle was a familiar story.  Sustainable economic development that was consistent with cultural values was also a central pillar for indigenous peoples  and Member States needed to recognize the positive contribution that successful indigenous economies made to national and regional economies. Sustainable economic development enabled indigenous peoples to take the lead in decisions that affected their own lives  he said.  While there was much to celebrate  both as States and as indigenous peoples  there were still many areas where improvement was needed.  It was necessary to communicate  to educate one another and to continually develop collective and individual knowledge.  He closed with the indigenous phrase “whatungarongaro te tangata  toitu te whenua”  which translates to “while people disappear  the land remains”. Ms. CARLING said she was pleased to note that the Saami representatives from the Russian Federation had joined the session  despite obstacles posed by that country.  Lands  territories and resources were at the heart of the collective survival of indigenous people  who were the peoples of the land  even before States were formed.  A tipping point was now being reached  with continuing land dispossession and destruction and militarization of lands  territories and resources. There were some positive developments regarding legal rights in some countries  but major challenges prevailed  she said.  The Outcome Document provided key action points for States to fulfil their obligations to indigenous peoples  whose informed consent was essential  prior to changes made to their lands.  She urged further steps to protect indigenous peoples’ rights. When the floor was opened to broader debate  GABRIEL QUIJANDRIA  Vice-Minister of Natural Resources’ Strategic Development of Peru  said his country recognized indigenous peoples’ right to land ownership.  However  that issue was still unresolved  since only 30 per cent of indigenous people had property rights over their land.  It was thus very important to ensure proof of ownership in order to provide more guarantees over legal and illegal activities there. ROGER CHO  a representative of the Pacific Caucus  said that the land didn’t belong to people  but rather the people belonged to the land.  He expressed support for the Outcome Document  but stressed that it was just one step in the fight for indigenous people  and expressed his hope that in the future a post of a High Commissioner for the rights of indigenous peoples would be established. CARLOS ALEMAN CUNNINGHAM  Coordinator of the Government of the North Caribbean Autonomous Region of Nicaragua  explained that land was an essential part of indigenous peoples’ daily lives  inextricably linked to their identity.  He echoed the call for continued efforts to achieve self-determination. MAANU PAORA (elder Maanu Paul)  a representative of Nga Kaiawhina A Wai 262 New Zealand  said indigenous people were guardians of the land and custodians of important biological heritage.  He called on States to observe Paragraph 8 of the Outcome Document and cooperate with the indigenous peoples to develop and implement national action plans.  In closing  he said:  “Signing the Document is the same as saying you are pregnant.  You cannot be half pregnant.  Rise up to meet the challenges!” The representative of the Solomon Islands  COLLIN BECK  said that people in his country spoke 87 languages.  For them  land was not just an asset; it was sacred.  The biggest challenge was to manage modern and traditional worlds  and to ensure indigenous people became active participants and not just spectators.  Post-2015 sustainable development goals were not only about poverty eradication  but also about healing the health of the planet.  He finished by saying that “indigenous peoples live not for themselves but for the common good of serving one another”. Also delivering statements were representatives of Canada  Costa Rica  Iran  Papua New Guinea and Paraguay. The representatives of the following United Nations entities and observers also spoke:  the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO)  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). Also taking the floor were speakers representing the Asia Caucus  Endorois Welfare Council  International Indigenous Women’s Forum (FIMI)  Indigenous World Association of Nakoa Ikaika Kalahui Hawaii  Arctic Caucus  the Indian Confederation of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples North East Zone and the Greater Sylhet Indigenous Peoples Forum of Bangladesh. Chief Perry Bellegarde of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations also spoke. Panel Discussion Patricia Balbuena  Vice-Minister for Interculturality of the Ministry of Culture of Peru  and Jannie Lasimbang  representative of the Asia Indigenous Region  co-chaired a panel discussion on “Indigenous priorities for the post-2015 sustainable development agenda”.  Panellists included Wu Hongbo  United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs; Albert Deterville  Chair of the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; and Saoudata Aboubacrine  representative of the Africa Indigenous Region. Opening the discussion  Ms. BALBUENA said her Government had actively participated in talks to establish sustainable development goals.  In coordination with Mexico  Guatemala and Costa Rica  it had participated in the discussions of the Open-ended Working Group on Sustainable Development.  The Government had made the rights of Peru’s indigenous peoples a priority.  Its programmes and policies were geared towards erasing discriminatory practices  ensuring food security  providing health-care services and offering bilingual education to indigenous peoples. Peru was the first country in Latin America to comply with International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169 on the rights of indigenous peoples  she said.  Six consultations between Peru’s indigenous peoples and their respective State authorities had led to satisfactory agreements concerning such concerns as land titles and natural resource use.  The Prime Minister had set up a commission to combat violence against indigenous communities. Ms. LASIMBANG said that the World Conference’s Outcome Document would set the context for future work on indigenous peoples’ issues.  She highlighted operative paragraph 37  which notes the commitment of States to give due consideration to all rights of indigenous peoples in the post-2015 development agenda.  Indigenous peoples comprised 15 per cent of the world’s poor  but just 5 per cent of its total population.  Non-sustainable development and extractive industry practices directly impacted them.  The post-2015 development agenda must address that situation and their overall well-being  and it must be aligned with the post-2015 development framework.  Commitments made in the Outcome Document provided impetus for the Declaration to be integrated into the post-2015 goals. Mr. WU said development had often led to the destruction of indigenous peoples’ political  economic  social  cultural  educational and knowledge systems.  The Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues had focused two sessions on the Millennium Development Goals and had made numerous recommendations to States  the United Nations system and others to ensure the goals responded to indigenous peoples’ specific concerns.  In the past  indigenous peoples’ rights had been largely invisible.  Drawing on the lessons of the Millennium Development Goals  the post-2015 development agenda must be bold and bridge the gaps in the Millennium targets to ensure inclusion of indigenous peoples’ rights and data. Mr. DETERVILLE said the post-2015 development agenda must include indigenous peoples’ rights.  At its seventh session in July 2014  the expert session had held a panel discussion on the need for free  prior and informed consent from indigenous peoples to be included in the post-2015 agenda.  He was concerned about its absence from the draft and the fact that indigenous peoples were paired with other vulnerable groups  despite the fact that they faced their own specific challenges.  The rights of indigenous peoples to education  particularly their rights to integrate their own educational perspectives  culture and knowledge  must be central to the fourth Millennium Development Goal on education. Ms. ABOUBACRINE  a member of the Tuareg tribe that inhabited the Saharan interior of North Africa  recounted the hardship suffered by the Tuareg and other indigenous peoples throughout Africa.  Even prior to colonization of the African continent by the Western world  indigenous peoples’ rights had been sacrificed to make way for development.  In the Sahel and in Central and West Africa  “how could one speak of the development of people without ensuring protection of their basic human rights and rights to their land?” she asked.  She recounted the story of a relative’s home being burned just because its owner was Tuareg.  The socioeconomic and cultural rights of the Tuareg and indigenous peoples must be upheld  otherwise they would fall victim to the deadly Ebola virus  terrorism and other global scourges.  She paid tribute to Tuareg civilians killed by the military and expressed solidarity with them and those detained in Burkina Faso. When the floor opened for discussion  the representative of Guatemala said that his country had developed a strategy that allowed it to respond to the “different dynamics of development”  pointing to a national agenda with a vision for 2032  the so-called Plan K’atun  which supported indigenous peoples’ ways of life  customs  traditions and forms of social organization.  His Government had developed specific mechanisms and reforms focused on such areas as racism  interculturalism  environment  crime prevention  migration and other policy areas aimed at eliminating inequality. The representative of Nepal pointed to constitutional  legal and administrative steps in her country  including formation of the National Foundation for Development of Indigenous Nationalities to protect indigenous peoples from discrimination  ensure their proportionate representation in education and the labour market. The representative of Papua New Guinea warned of a threat to the very survival of indigenous communities in the Pacific  where several island States were at risk of submerging completely due to a rise in sea-level caused by climate change. A representative of the Central  South America and the Caribbean Caucus stressed the importance of land access for indigenous peoples  and of obtaining their free  prior and informed consent for use of any land they inhabited. A representative of the Indian Law Resource Center pointed to the prevalence of violence against indigenous women in the United States and elsewhere.  In the United States  one in three indigenous women would be raped in her lifetime. A representative of the Te Rarawa and Ngati Kuri Maori people of New Zealand said that there was a “profound functional relationship” between the sustainable development goals outlined in the Outcome Document and the rights of indigenous peoples.  Moreover  indigenous peoples’ ability to realize those rights was tied to their right to privacy  freedom of expression  freedom of assembly  freedom from unreasonable search and seizure  and freedom of the press.  Without securing those freedoms  those goals could not be fully implemented. A representative of the World Food Programme (WFP) said indigenous people must be at the centre of WFP’s Zero Hunger Challenge.  The 2014 State of Food Insecurity in the World indicated putting the Millennium hunger target within reach  food insecurity and poor nutrition remained development and health issues for indigenous peoples worldwide  even in countries showing good overall progress towards erasing hunger.  Most food-insecure people were already feeling the effects of climate change  and indigenous knowledge had been instrumental in coping with the resulting effects. Also participating in the discussion were representatives of Botswana  Chile  Ecuador  the Russian Federation and the United States. A representative of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) also spoke. Interventions were also made by representatives of the Arctic Indigenous Caucus  Fondo para el Desarollo de los Pueblos Indigenas de America Latina y Caribe  Bangladesh Indigenous Peoples Forum and Kapaeeng  Kalipunan Ng Mga Katutubong Mamamayan Ng Pilipinas  Pacific Disability Forum  African Union Commission  International Indian Treaty Council and the International Development Law Organization. Closing Remarks JAN ELIASSON  Deputy Secretary-General  said that the United Nations was proud to work closely with all indigenous peoples and their partners around the world to secure their rights and address their concerns.  The Conference on Indigenous Peoples built on the work and results since the 2007 Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  That text was the foundation and guiding star  while the Conference Outcome Document was an inspiration and the path forward.  Working together  indigenous peoples and Member States had identified priorities and necessary actions on land  resources  justice systems  education  health and development. However  globally  indigenous peoples continued to lag behind others on education  health  employment and even life expectancy.  He said that he intended to deal with those problems along with the Secretary-General by building on the momentum generated already by the current Conference.  The United Nations was currently identifying its global development priorities beyond 2015  and it was essential to make indigenous peoples’ issues a part of that new agenda.  The desired future would value and preserve diversity  and required a more equitable and sustainable use of the world’s resources. It was the collective responsibility of Member States  indigenous peoples  United Nations agencies  funds and programmes  civil society and the academic world to transform the Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples into reality.  That would require determination  tenacity  appropriate legal framework  human and institutional capacities  and finally  political will.  As had been stated earlier  political will was a renewable resource. GHAZALI OHORELLA  Representative of the Pacific Indigenous Region and Co-Chair of interactive round-table discussion I  said that  if we continued in this spirit  our work would no longer seem impossible  but inevitable.  The Outcome Document was a milestone for indigenous peoples  and the time had come for the United Nations to move from promises to action and include indigenous peoples in all areas of its work. He noted that several speakers had called for an appointment of a senior official for indigenous peoples’ issues  and numerous participants had committed to fully support a system-wide action plan.  Placing indigenous peoples’ lands in the hands of indigenous people would lead to the realization of their rights; they needed to be the protagonists of their own development.  Indigenous peoples were the “miners’ canary” of the world  and the mercury in the barometer of the successes and failures of the United Nations.  And  he concluded  the round table was a “map of the stars” to help realize the ancestors’ dreams. DAVID CHOQUEHUANCA  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bolivia and Co-Chair of interactive round-table discussion II  said that the focus of that segment had been on implementing the rights of indigenous peoples at the national and local levels.  Many speakers had welcomed the Outcome Document and taken note of the specific commitments to action by States and the United Nations. Both Member States and indigenous representatives  he said  had pointed to advances at the national level in implementing the rights of indigenous peoples  including the recognition of their rights in national constitutions  laws  policies and programmes.  At the same time  speakers had referred to ongoing challenges and to the role of the United Nations system in advancing  rights.  The Outcome Document advocated the enhanced participation of indigenous representatives at the United Nations  which was welcomed by both Member States and indigenous representatives. Ms. LASIMBANG  Secretary Director of Pengarah Urusetai and Co-Chair of the panel discussion on indigenous priorities for the post-2015 sustainable development agenda  said that indigenous peoples should participate actively in the implementation of that agenda.  In order to achieve sustainable development  it was imperative to be respectful of indigenous peoples’ development  according to their own aspirations and needs  and with respect to their cultures and identities. Detailing the contributions of panellists  she said that indigenous people were among the poorest in the world  and did not have the same access to social services.  For the post-2015 agenda  the Declaration should be integrated into that agenda  and she urged constructive dialogue in that regard. Ms. CARLING  Co-Chair of interactive round-table discussion III  said that representatives had spoken of their close relationships to the lands  territories and resources  as that was at the heart of their survival and development.  That relationship was outlined in various articles of the Declaration and the Outcome Document.  However  speakers had pointed out that there was a lack of recognition of those lands  territories and resources  and of indigenous peoples in general. Some States  she said  had recognized indigenous peoples’ land rights and taken measures to protect sacred sites and heritage areas.  She urged the United Nations to implement programmes that addressed indigenous peoples’ management of lands and food resources  and which enhanced biodiversity and food security. She said indigenous peoples had now reached a tipping point on their continuing collective survival as distinct peoples  due to the dispossession  destruction and militarization of their lands  territories and resources.  For many decades  those issues had been their primary and urgent concern.  In many instances  indigenous lands had been occupied  and activities such as timber and mining and the creation of national parks  among others  had led to forced evacuation  without prior informed consent.  That was increasing poverty  marginalization and conflicts. With that  she called for “legal security” of lands to maintain sustainable development.  She also urged partnerships between indigenous peoples and Governments.  States  she said  should establish impartial processes to adjudicate indigenous peoples’ rights over resources  as reflected in the Outcome Document. SETAREKI MACANAWAI  Indigenous Disabilities representative  said he was grateful to be the voice of the voiceless  of those at the margins of society.  He believed that indigenous persons with disabilities were overrepresented among those living in absolute poverty. The Outcome Document  he said  included meaningful references to indigenous persons with disabilities.  Only an inclusive and empowered society would ensure that no one was left behind  and that meant that decisions affecting indigenous persons with disabilities should not be taken without their full participation.  He stressed the importance of including them in the post-2015 development agenda. LAURIE PHIPPS (United States)  Vice-President of the General Assembly  reading a statement from the General Assembly President  said that during the round-table discussions  speakers had stressed the vital importance of implementing the Declaration.  Echoing that call to action  she urged Member States  the United Nations system  civil society and the private sector to “do your part to keep the momentum of our discussions moving forward in a positive and productive manner”.  The Assembly’s adoption of the Outcome Document marked a new chapter in the engagement between indigenous peoples and Member States  she said.  Its action-oriented provisions would lead to broad changes for current and future generations of indigenous peoples  with its focus on the rights of indigenous women and the intractable problem of violence against them  as well as the challenges faced by indigenous youth.  Also dominant was the difficulty in sustaining indigenous languages  the need to preserve traditional knowledge and the requirement to ensure sustainable livelihoods.  Those issues formed the core of the full-spectrum  integrated agenda sought by indigenous people over the last two decades. Mr. SHARPLES delivered a closing prayer for the Conference.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-09-22,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11556.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. General Assembly Twenty-eighth Special Session 1st Meeting (PM)   Despite remarkable strides in women’s rights and empowerment worldwide in the last two decades  greater global efforts were needed to ensure full gender equality  human dignity  sustainable growth and the future of the planet  senior United Nations officials told the General Assembly today. As we celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the Cairo Conference and look ahead to the future  we cannot afford to short-change development  said Ban Ki-moon  Secretary-General of the United Nations  as he opened the Assembly’s special session to review progress in implementing the goals set forth during the landmark 1994 International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo. Some 800 women still died each day from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth  and an estimated 8.7 million young women in developing countries resorted to unsafe abortions every year  he said.  Millions of people  particularly in the world’s poorest countries  still suffered from poverty  hunger  unemployment  low life expectancy and scant access to health care and education. With the Cairo Programme of Action as its guide  the international community must confront challenges caused by rising inequality  urbanization  migration  population ageing and the largest generation of young people in history  as well as hammer out an ambitious post-2015 development path and a meaningful climate change agreement before the end of next year.  As we advance on all these fronts  we have to remember the vision of Cairo  especially the priority it placed on reproductive health  he said. Echoing those concerns  Babatunde Osotimehin  Executive Director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)  noted that access to good health care and reproductive rights remained elusive for many women and that not a single country had achieved full gender equality.  Young girls were still forced to marry men six times their age and were subjected to sexual violence during time of conflict.  We cannot advance by leaving half of the population — our women and girls — behind  he said. Moreover  there could be no talk of sustainable development without adequate investment in the health  education and employment of youth  he emphasized  adding that investment in universal public services was among the most effective just actions Governments could take to create a foundation for equality and resource efficiency. Sam Kutesa ( Uganda)  General Assembly President  said the 20-year review of the Cairo action plan revealed that poverty  discrimination  and income and wealth inequality threatened economic growth and the well-being of individuals  societies and the planet.  Those challenges should be addressed in the post-2015 development agenda  while the impact of population dynamics must be better integrated into national  regional and international strategies.  A coordinated  systematic response was needed  an aim which he intended to promote during the Assembly’s sixty-ninth session. Senior Government officials from 90 countries participated in the session.  Overall  they agreed that population concerns must be at the core of the post-2015 development agenda and cited the need for universal access to basic services such as health care and education.  They shed light on their respective national trends in maternal and infant mortality  fertility  contraceptive use  ageing and HIV/AIDS prevalence  as well as programmes for family planning and sex education  among other areas.  Several speakers voiced strong support for sexual and reproductive rights  and representatives from developing countries appealed for reliable financial and technical aid to implement their respective sustainable development agendas. At the outset of the meeting  the Assembly took note of the text concerning the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations  which concerned Article 19 of the Charter (document A/S-29/2).  It unanimously elected Mr. Kutesa as the President of its twenty-ninth special session  and the Vice Presidents and Chairpersons of its Main Committees of its sixty-ninth regular session to serve in the same capacity during the special session.  The Assembly also adopted its provisional agenda (document A/S-29/1). The Assembly also took note of the Secretary-General’s reports on the subject and the report of the Commission on Population and Development on its forty-seventh session  as well as approved the report of the Credentials Committee on the Assembly’s twenty-ninth special session. Speaking today were the Heads and Deputy Heads of State and Government of Bolivia (on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China)  Uganda  Chile  Grenada  Antigua and Barbuda  Georgia  Togo  Panama  Swaziland  Finland  Tuvalu  Burundi  Ghana  Honduras  Serbia  Republic of Moldova  Trinidad and Tobago and Palau. Also participating in the session were ministers  senior Government officials and representatives of Chad  Myanmar  Turkmenistan  Mauritania  Nepal  Mozambique  Netherlands  Bangladesh  Kazakhstan  Denmark  Azerbaijan  European Union  France  Luxembourg  Cuba  Germany  Guinea  Jamaica  Iceland  Djibouti  Australia  Mongolia  Viet Nam  Barbados  China  Pakistan  Uruguay  Estonia  Guyana  Malaysia  Dominican Republic  Canada  Maldives  Sweden  Ecuador  Suriname  Ukraine  Sri Lanka  Botswana  Costa Rica  Belgium  Mexico  Tunisia  Sierra Leone  Democratic Republic of the Congo  Zimbabwe  Niger  El Salvador  South Africa  Ethiopia  Zambia  United Republic of Tanzania  Sao Tome and Principe  Guinea-Bissau  Venezuela  Cameroon  Burkina Faso  Gambia  Marshall Islands  Benin  Egypt  Poland  Italy  Peru  Switzerland  Lao Peoples Democratic Republic  Namibia  South Sudan  Afghanistan  Belarus  Kenya and the Republic of the Congo. Also speaking were representatives of the International Planned Parenthood Federation  Red de Salud de Mujeres Latinoamericanas y del Caribe  Actions Health Incorporated  Asia Pacific Resource Centre for Women and the Global Youth Action Network. Background As the General Assembly began its twenty-ninth special session  Follow-up to the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development: beyond 2014  it had before it three related notes by the Secretariat:  the first (document A/S-29/3) transmitting the report of the Secretary-General on the framework of such follow-up activities (document A/69/62); the second (document A/S-29/4) transmitting the report of the Secretary-General on recurrent themes and key elements identified during the sessions of the Commission on Population and Development(document A/69/122); and the third (document A/S-29/5) transmitting the report of the Commission on Population and Development on its forty-seventh session (E/2014/25-E/CN.9/2014/7). Statements SAM KUTESA (Uganda)  President of the General Assembly  noted that 20 years ago  the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo had affirmed that population is not about numbers; it is about people.  A consensus had been reached then on a Programme of Action to transform the quality of life for all  to expand human choices  and to achieve economic growth and sustainable development.  Today  we recall and reaffirm the historic goals and objectives of the 1994 Cairo Conference to better prepare for the future we want  he stated. Celebrating the considerable progress made  as shown by the 20-year review of the Programme of Action  he acknowledged the leadership provided by Governments  as well as the contribution by civil society  including religious communities  youth groups and women's organizations  among others.  He also recognized the decisions of parents to educate their children  especially girls  and thanked the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for its support of national efforts to implement the Cairo agenda. Still  he continued  much remained to be done  stressing that it was essential to urgently address the review’s findings  which shows that  despite significant gains in poverty reduction and economic growth  many people had been left behind.  Poverty  discrimination  income and wealth inequality threatened economic growth and the well-being of individuals  societies and the planet.  Those challenges should be addressed in the post-2015 development agenda. The review concluded that investing in individual human rights  capabilities and dignity across sectors and throughout life was the foundation of sustainable development  and had significant implications for development policy  he said.  The impact of population dynamics must be better integrated into development planning at the national  regional and international levels. A coordinated  systematic response was needed  an aim which he intended to promote during the sixty-ninth General Assembly  he said.  It was critical to build upon lessons learned and to maintain the momentum.  Together with the Millennium Development Goals  the ICPD agenda had helped pave the way for the post-2015 development agenda and the achievement of sustainable development.  He called for a commitment to stronger action  guided by the “Beyond 2014” review  to fully implement the Cairo Programme of Action. BAN KI-MOON  Secretary-General of the United Nations  said the Cairo Programme of Action agreed to 20 years ago at the ICPD had made a meaningful difference in people's lives  citing cases in which a Niger girl  who had been forced to marry an older man  then became an advocate in ending child marriage; a South Sudanese woman  after giving birth in a displacement camp  going on to learn life-saving skills needed for pregnancy-related complications; and a Philippine mother who had recognized her right to choose how many children she wanted. However  millions of people were still suffering from hunger and poverty and dying from preventable causes  he pointed out.  They could not meet their basic needs  find meaningful work  access health and education services  or enjoy their basic rights.  Since 1994  there had been only limited improvements in the lives of an estimated 1 billion people living in the poorest countries.  Their life expectancies continued to be unacceptably low.  As we celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the Cairo Conference and look ahead to future  we cannot afford to short-change development  he said. It was for those reasons  he stated  that the international community was bolstering efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by the 2015 deadline  as well as defining a bold  ambitious post-2015 development agenda that was inclusive and sustainable  and working to deliver a meaningful climate change agreement before the end of next year.  Tomorrow's Climate Summit should generate strong political will with bold announcements.  As we advance on all these fronts  we have to remember the vision of Cairo  especially the priority it placed on reproductive health  he said. The international community must confront the fact that some 800 women still died each day from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth  and an estimated 8.7 million young women in developing countries resorted to unsafe abortions every year  he stressed.  They urgently needed protection.  The international community must also be guided by the Cairo action plan as it confronted major demographic trends  including urbanization  migration  population ageing and the largest generation of young people in history.  We must renew our pledge to protect people — especially women and girls — as we strive to eradicate poverty  protect the rights and dignity of all people and secure the future of our planet for generations to come  he said. BABATUNDE OSOTIMEHIN  Executive Director of UNFPA  said that  in 1992  at the World Summit on Sustainable Development  the world had rallied around that concept.  Two years later  in Cairo  the principle was defined in real terms  shifting the focus from real numbers to real life  by recognizing that human rights and human dignity for all was crucial to achieving sustainable development.  Advances made by women over the last 20 years  for example  showed how powerful human rights and dignity could be. However  observing that the world was becoming more unequal  he stressed that until we can deliver for all people equitably  sustainable development could not be achieved.  The Assembly had adopted numerous resolutions on the importance of access to good health care for all  but for many  reproductive rights were not available.  That included the 10-year-old girl forced to marry a 62-year-old man and forced to bear his children before she was psychologically or physically prepared  or the many women and girls subjected to sexual violence during time of conflict. Although progress had been made  he noted  not a single country in the world had realized full gender equality.  Only by addressing gender equality would the world be able to build the future it wanted.  We cannot advance by leaving half of the population — our women and girls — behind  he said. With the world seeing its largest generation of young people  he said there could be no talk of sustainable development without adequate investment in their health  education and employment.  Young people needed to be equipped with skills  agency and resilience.  “You hold the future of the world’s young people in your hands.  Invest in them because they hold the world’s future in theirs ” he said. Sustainability was about meeting the needs and aspirations of today’s population while planning and making policy for tomorrow’s population.  There was no greater challenge today than climate change.  Investing in universal public services was one of the most effective and just actions Governments could take to create a foundation for equality and resource efficiency. It was not possible to talk about sustainable development without ensuring the needs of young people were met  without addressing women’s empowerment  and without ensuring that all had access to sexual and reproductive rights  he emphasized.  Those issues must be at the core of sustainable development.  That was the only answer to the challenges of sustainable development. EVO MORALES AYMA  President of Bolivia  speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 developing countries and China  said it was critical to support developing countries' efforts to eradicate poverty and inequality.  There had been unevenness in gaps in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the vast socioeconomic challenges of developing countries.  Developed countries should fulfil their official development assistance (ODA) pledges and give developing countries new  sustainable financial resources to implement their respective development agendas.  Development strategies should be tailored to the individual needs of each country  with North-South cooperation at its core  and South-South and triangular cooperation as a complement.  The Assembly's agreement in early September to negotiate and adopt a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes to improve the global financial system had given developing countries hope. Population issues must be addressed comprehensively and be at the core of the post-2015 development agenda  he said.  Maternal mortality had declined in some regions in developing countries  but increased in others.  HIV prevalence had almost doubled since 2001 in least developed countries; two-thirds of those living with that virus were women.  He recalled the target to eliminate all harmful practices against all women and girls  such as child marriage and female genital mutilation.  Everyone should have access to basic medical services  as well as affordable and safe medicine.  A universal  quality health-care system was vital.  He called on developed countries and international financial institutions to provide adequate financial resources and technology to developing countries to enable the latter to provide basic health services for all their citizens.  Such funding should also include a cultural and human perspective  geared towards protecting the rights of migrants and their families.  The Group of 77 was exploring a possible legally binding convention on labour and development to protect migrants' rights and their contribution to development. YOWERI KAGUTA MUSEVENI  President of Uganda  said that  between 1992 and 2014  his country’s population living in poverty had been reduced from 56 per cent to 19 per cent.  As well  there had been significant reductions in AIDS infections  and all suffering from the disease were in anti-retroviral programmes.  There were also improvements in women's rights and primary education  where the ratio between girls and boys was now “50-50”. The Government had increased investment in family planning and reproductive health  he went on to say  with more women voluntarily planning their families  and thus  significantly increasing their life expectancy.  With a youthful population  the Government recognized that education could be very effective for economic growth and was working towards empowering young people  as well as working on challenges of climate change. MICHELLE BACHELET  President of Chile  said there were many unresolved global issues.  There were 1.2 billion people living in extreme poverty; 842 million suffered from malnutrition and 99 million children under the age of five were undernourished and below the proper weight for their age.  It was impossible to advance development if more than one third of the world's population lacked adequate health care and 748 million were forced to use unfit water sources.  Governments must set out a new development agenda that could be applied in an integrated  comprehensive manner.  She endorsed and promoted the Secretary-General's report on follow up to the action programme.  While the strong culture of respect for international human rights that had been achieved reflected an important gain  armed conflicts  terrorism  authoritarian regimes and discrimination posed threats that required the international community to bolster efforts towards prevention  education and control. Health and social protection systems must be equipped to deal with today’s realities  she said  noting that people were living longer.  The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that the number of people over age 60 would double by 2050 compared to 2000 figures  with 80 per cent of them in low- and middle-income countries.  The risk of non-communicable diseases and the need to provide long-term nursing care and to improve primary care systems would compound such challenges.  All international actors must make specific  measurable commitments at tomorrow’s Climate Summit to address climate change.  Migration-related challenges should be tackled holistically.  She called for an international convention. MOUSSA FAKI MAHAMAT  Minister for Foreign Affairs and African Integration of Chad  said his country had been able to consolidate democracy and reduce poverty by 8.12 per cent between 2003 and 2011.  Furthermore  measures had been taken to fight climate change  promote gender equality and qualitatively and quantitatively improve education  especially for women and girls.  Progress in the area of human rights had also been made. A law on maternal health had been passed in 2002  he said  providing access to reproductive health care without limitations.  The plan dedicated 15 per cent of the national budget to health.  Maternal mortality remained an important issue as mothers lost their children during birth and too many girls were still subjected to violence in their villages.  Further  the outcome adopted at the African Union summit on how to implement the ICPD agenda beyond 2014 was being incorporated at the national level  so as to ensure dignity and equality  including reproductive health care and family planning. KEITH MITCHELL  Prime Minister of Grenada  noting considerable progress made in implementing the Programme of Action  focussed on challenges that remained  notably that despite progress  many had been left behind.  He expressed satisfaction that human rights and equality defined the report's analytical approach.  Its focus on increasing wealth and income inequalities; unfulfilled gender equality and women's empowerment; the need for life-long learning and building human capabilities  especially for the young; addressing inequalities in access to sexual and reproductive health services  including through strengthening health systems both in rural and urban areas  had significant implications for development policy. Further  he said that increasingly diverse household structures and living arrangements required planning for and building sustainable cities and strengthening urban-rural linkages.  Population dynamics should be integrated into development planning at the national  regional and international level.  Development challenges also required the systematic participation of all stakeholders crafting responses  requiring  in turn  partnership and global leadership through the United Nations.  In that context  he noted that Grenada had joined the regional plan of action for the further implementation of ICPD beyond 2014. GASTON BROWNE  Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda  said that in the Caribbean the problem of inequality was not due to population growth  but to international financial institutions’ refusals to grant the region’s nations concessional financing and to forgive or meaningfully restructure their debt.  Unemployment  particularly among youth  was the most severe challenge  leaving young people with no future.  Furthermore  the chikungunya virus was spreading across the Caribbean  devastating local economies.  Its effect on tourism  which accounted for approximately 60 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in many Caribbean countries  could be devastating.  Yet  the international community had not responded to the challenges already posed by the disease in West Africa.  While actions by China  Cuba and the United States were helpful  a global response was needed more than ever.  If the international community waited for a global pandemic before it acted as one  it would set the world back even more than the 2008 financial crisis or the preceding recession.  Small countries like Antigua and Barbuda were anxious to overcome youth unemployment and guard against health threats.  A sustained global effort was needed and any review of the Cairo action plan must reflect that. WUNNA MAUNG LWIN  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Myanmar  praised the Secretary-General's wide-ranging report  and its focus on human rights and equality  and the right to development  adequate health care and quality education in developing countries.  He endorsed the report’s conclusion that investing in individual rights  capabilities and dignity across multiple sectors was the foundation of sustainable development.  He supported the regional action plan to further implement the Cairo Programme of Action.  The Myanmar National Commission on Population and Development had endorsed the findings of the 2014 global review.  The review had recognized his country’s progress in some areas  as well as need for more efforts to fill in gaps.  For the first time in 30 years  Myanmar had successfully conducted a nationwide census on population and housing.  The results would enable the Government to improve planning and development.  The findings revealed a greater percentage of women than men in the national population of 51.42 million  highlighting the need for a greater focus on the development of women  children and youth in national programmes.  Also recorded was data on age  fertility  deaths  migration and household size. IRAKLI GARIBASHVILI  Prime Minister of Georgia  said that his country's population agenda had led to fewer women dying in childbirth and fewer unwanted pregnancies  as well as expanded opportunities for young people.  Nonetheless  more needed to be done  and in that regard  a host of initiatives were being prepared.  A flagship programme on universal health care had been launched  ensuring that every citizen had a basic package of out-patient  in-patient and emergency health services.  Georgia also had a comprehensive social protection strategy that focused on protecting the elderly against poverty  among others  utilizing a public-private fund to mobilize non-budgetary resources.  In 2013  his country had ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities among other measures taken to promote human rights.  Citing the more than 450 000 displaced persons in Georgia  he noted the goal of promoting their social and economic integration until their safe return to their homes was possible. FAURE ESSOZIMNA GNASSINGBE  President of Togo  said that his Government had undertaken many steps towards implementing the Cairo Programme of Action Plan  despite a fragile economy.  Institutional and legal frameworks had been put in place to foster economic growth  gender equality and access to sexual and reproductive health services.  Between 1998 and 2013  Togo registered a 7 per cent reduction in maternal mortality  a 70 per cent reduction in infant mortality  a 5 per cent reduction in infant mortality  a slight drop in the fertility rate  a significant increase in the use of modern contraceptive prevalence  a slight drop in the HIV prevalence rate and encouraging results in eradicating female genital mutilation and gender-based violence. To improve maternal health and further reduce maternal and infant mortality  further multilateral efforts were vital  he said.  To that end  the United Nations had an important role to play.  Togo would undertake efforts to build institutional capacity and resilience in order to foster sustainable development.  He fully endorsed the African Union’s position for implementing the Programme of Action beyond 2014.  Commitments of the Action Plan should be fully in line with the sustainable development goals.  He called on the international community to strengthen solidarity towards that end. ISABEL SAINT MALO  Vice President of Panama  said that  because of still-existing profound inequalities that disproportionately affected women and girls  the action programme beyond 2014 was imperative.  She called on Member States to give new impetus to the population and development agenda.  Panama’s population policies  based on equality and equity  focused on reducing high rates of maternal mortality and improving maternal health care.  The Government was committed to translate the country’s high economic growth in past years into dynamic  inclusive development that reduced the large income and development gaps.  Consolidating the social protection system could make it possible to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty. The Government was also focused on reducing malnutrition  she said.  A mix of universal education grants and a network of educational aid were being employed to keep students in school.  The Mesoamerican Health 2015 initiative had invested in efforts to improve access to health-care services  as well as reduce  in the short- and medium-term  the unmet needs of family planning and rates of maternal and child mortality in indigenous areas.  In addition  health services were being geared towards preventing non-communicable diseases. BARNABAS SIBUSISO DLAMINI  Prime Minister of Swaziland  outlining how the Programme of Action had guided population policy and programmes in Swaziland over the past 20 years  underscored that people were now at the centre of development  and human rights were the focus.  In efforts to implement the requisite policy  legal and institutional frameworks  laws were being enacted that ensured the protection for women and girls  the prevention of human-trafficking and the prosecution of domestic violence and sexual offences.  As well  the 2005 Constitution contained a Bill of Rights.  Progress had also been made against HIV/AIDS  including cultural-based initiatives that promoted chastity.  Despite his strong commitment to the goals  gaps in implementation stemmed from poor economic performance and related fiscal challenges  volatile food and energy prices  and difficulties posed by climate change. TARJA HALONEN  former President of Finland  pointed to uneven progress in implementing the Programme of Action.  Inequality and discrimination remained barriers to people's health and well-being.  Women  the young  the poor and minority groups were particularly affected  and differences in gender identity and sexual orientation could not be a basis for differences in the enjoyment of rights.  If people could not decide for themselves on their most private matters  how could we expect them to be able to take broader responsibilities for their communities and the environment  she asked. She underscored the importance of UNFPA  reflected in the $58 million Finland contributed to it in 2014  which was their largest contribution to any United Nations body.  She congratulated the Fund for its increased focus on adolescents and young people  especially young girls  and stressed their need for skills  and youth-friendly services  including comprehensive sexuality education and information.  She called for sustained momentum  moving forward boldly with the recommendations of the review. ENELE SOSENE SOPOAGA  Prime Minister of Tuvalu  listed his country’s intrinsic development constraints  including small land areas  remoteness  lack of natural resources and exposure to environmental disasters.  Significant progress had been made  however  with achievements in education  child mortality and maternal health  as well as in gender equality  HIV/AIDS and the environment.  A priority in national policy was controlling net population growth because of the small total land area.  Fifty-seven per cent of the population lived in the capital  putting pressure on the already-fragile atoll environment  and compounding pressure on water and food supply  and waste management.  Tuvalu’s youth faced scarce employment opportunities  and the Government was aiding young seafarers to increase their competitiveness.  Education policies and the expansion of gender equality and opportunities for women  together with efforts to tackle violence against women  were being implemented.  His country’s strong cultural values were underscored in the Government’s initiatives  emphasizing the family unit while investing in individual human rights.  With 70 per cent of all deaths caused by non-communicable diseases  tackling them remained a priority  and a national strategy plan was in place to deal with that.  Stressing that the solution to climate change would be found in collective action  he called for bold commitments to be made during the upcoming Climate Summit. PIERRE NKURUNZIZA  Vice President of Burundi  said his country shared the view of the Secretary-General that in order to achieve dignity and human rights for all  it was crucial to eradicate extreme poverty and achieve inclusion.  Burundi would continue to promote the rights of young people  including those who had left school  and ensure that boys and girls completed their primary education.  His country was currently enacting a law to prohibit educational discrimination based on gender. With regards to health in general  particularly sexual and reproductive health  gains had been made  he said.  Maternal mortality had dropped  due in part to free maternal care that was now given to pregnant women  as well as an increase in access to modern contraception.  Sex education curricula had also been established in schools  and he appealed to partners to step up their efforts to provide technological and financial resources to ensure good quality health care  including reproductive health-care and family planning. RASHID MEREDOV  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan  said the international community must examine what had been done so far regarding population and development  and set goals for the future.  Thus far  Member States had accumulated enormous experience on that topic over the past 20 years  and were moving in the right direction.  Turkmenistan had a launched large-scale public programmes in public health.  Since 1992  his Government and UNFPA had begun a number of initiatives aimed to implement long-term strategies on population.  Living standards had improved  and his country was striving to improve reproductive health and ensure gender equality.  Effective implementation was only possible on the basis of consolidated multilateral efforts  with the United Nations playing a lead role. JOHN DRAMANI MAHAMA  President of Ghana  describing his country’s involvement in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union processes  said that such efforts showed Ghana’s commitment to the Programme of Action.  Women and young people were especially important  and significant institutional and policy progress had been made on gender equality.  In addition  health-care access had been expanded through programmes like the community-based Health Planning and Services Initiative  and maternal mortality was declining through initiatives like the Campaign for Accelerated Reduction of Maternal Mortality in Africa  which worked to curb pregnancy-related deaths. On maternal health  he noted that Ghana had also implemented the Millennium Development Goal V Acceleration Framework  which included the establishment of 15 new clinics in Ghana's most deprived and most populous two regions.  In addition  a Youth Policy and Action Plan had been committed to  which included the youth entrepreneur initiative.  The Plan of Action should be included in the post-2015 development agenda. JUAN ORLANDO HERNÁNDEZ ALVARADO  President of Honduras  reiterated his support for the Montevideo consensus on population and development  stressing his commitment to all vulnerable groups.  On a national level  progress had been made on infant and maternal mortality  family planning and on HIV-AIDS through legislation and public policy.  In the upcoming elections  women would be guaranteed at least 50 per cent of the posts in public office  a policy that had been made during his tenure as President of Congress.  While listing other advances  he noted that the report had also revealed persistent inequality in Honduras. Extreme poverty was mainly rural  he said  but it was also important to understand the demographic trends associated with urban poverty.  The population  being young  were productive and could fuel growth and provide support to poorer sections of society.  Investments were being made to reduce the portion of the youth population neither working nor in education  with new jobs available and efforts to provide training in the English language.  Many Hondurans were fleeing organized crime and migrating  with seven out of every nine people crossing borders from cities along trafficking routes.  He called on the United Nations  especially the United States  to support Honduras on the basis of shared responsibility. IVICA DAČIĆ  Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia  pointed out that the world had changed in the past 20 years.  The same values remained  but not the same problems faced by the international community.  Noting the unstinting support his country had received from UNFPA  he said that the aging of the population was its most visible population issue  as the median age was the highest in its region of Europe.  Of particular concern was the fact that the ratio of worker to retiree was now one to one.  The Council on Aging and Old Age Affairs had been established in 2007  dealing with national policy and strategies.  The question of population migration was of great importance  as many individuals were leaving Serbia every year  resulting in a continual brain drain.  Needed now were national strategies in population and development and in reproductive health. NATALIA GHERMAN  Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Moldova  said the Millennium Development Goals  the Cairo Program of Action  and the Beijing Platform for Action constituted unfinished business.  Quality of life had improved  opportunities had expanded  and the role of women in the social and political life of the country had grown.  The objective was to shift the population development paradigm from quantity to quality  for a healthy and skilled population to generate economic prosperity.  Past experience in designing and delivering on population related goals showed that good data collection was key for effective population planning and policy.  He underscored his country’s commitment to contribute to the international community's efforts in advancing the scope and the goals of ICPD. LEMINA MOMA  Minister for Social Affairs of Mauritania  associating himself with the Arab Group  the African Group and the Group of 77 and China  said the Congress on Population Policies in 2012 was one of several efforts to build a strategy aimed at achieving the goals of the Programme of Action.  Education  particularly female education  was to the fore  as was reproductive health.  Vulnerable segments of society were important and efforts were made to address the economic empowerment of women  gender-based violence  employment and persons with disabilities.  The Government’s tasks were not complete and more effort was needed to improve living standards and establish justice and equality.  Since the Conference  the world had seen economic gains and poverty reduction  but significant segments of the population still lacked protection in education and employment.  She affirmed her country’s support for the Addis Ababa Declaration  and called for the review’s recommendations to be integrated into the post-2015 development agenda. MAHENDRA BAHADUR PANDEY  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal  described progress made in his country to achieve the objectives of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development.  A long-term Population Perspective Plan 2010-2031 mainstreamed population and development issues in development and a new comprehensive population policy was under way.  He called for total elimination of poverty  and improved social and human development targeted at particularly vulnerable sections of the population.  He stressed the need to take advantage of the “demographic dividend” enjoyed by Nepal in the form of a large proportion of the population being of working age.  Migrant workers played a vital role in development of countries of destination and origin and that needed greater appreciation globally  with better appreciation of their rights.  The goals set in population and development activities should be matched by means of implementation through multi-stakeholder participation and the galvanized efforts  focused particularly on addressing the needs of least developed countries. KAMLA PERSAD-BISSESSAR  Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago  outlined her Government’s key areas of activity  stressing that the focus was people-centric.  A significant portion of budgetary resources were dedicated to education and programmes targeting women  especially single mothers.  Having already achieved the Millennium Development Goals relating to education  the aim was now “MDG Plus”.  Children born to underprivileged parents could expect Government assistance.  Challenges remained  but future generations needed equality and equity.  Development partners still needed to assist and strengthen her country’s ability to implement its policies.  Programmes were being developed to address pre-natal and neo-natal care to ensure her country would not be left behind  and investment would be made in ensuring individual human rights.  A holistic approach that recognized the importance of human rights and accounted for population dynamics was needed. AIUBA CUERENEIA  Minister for Planning and Development of Mozambique  said that sexual and reproductive rights and health deserved particular attention  through the establishment of facilities that youth could access.  Gender inequalities were being ameliorated  however  more progress needed to be made.  Remaining challenges were evidence of the Cairo Programme of Action  to improve the living conditions of the population.  The respect of human rights and gender equality  as well as the improvement of living conditions  required the sustained attention of the Government. LILIANNE PLOUMEN  Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation of the Netherlands  relating women's stories from detention centres  said they always began with the men came and then they….  She said she thought of those stories as she prepared for this session  and of the need to look out for such women and girls.  There had been strides in women's rights  including improvements in health  increased education  and fewer unwanted births to young mothers.  Yet  it was important not to be complacent.  Each day  800 women died from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth.  Many women wanted to prevent pregnancy  but lacked access to contraception.  The international community needed to deliver more on the promises of 1994  including comprehensive sexuality education for all young people  and to end child  early and forced marriages and female genital mutilation.  Now was the time to follow through and adopt relevant goals.  That was important not only for individual well-being  but also the well-being of societies. ZAHID MALEK  Minister for Health of Bangladesh  noted that his country had attained most of the Millennium Development Goals.  Population growth was under control and new measures and targets were being pursued.  Infant and maternal mortality were declining  and equity and equality were the focus of policies on infant  maternal and reproductive health.  The Government had set the minimum age for marriage of women at 18 to reduce the prevalence of marriage of adolescents.  Awareness about the education needs of girls was growing in schools and overall social and economic progress continued.  Financing efforts to achieve those goals was the main challenge  particularly while simultaneously facing new development challenges  such as non-communicable diseases and climate change  to name a few.  He voiced hope the post-2015 development agenda would seek to tackle such new challenges. MAHABBATT BEKBOSYNOVA  Minister of Kazakhstan  said national policies were focused on fostering the abilities of children  especially girls and young women.  The aim was to equip the younger generations to fulfil their potential and make economic contributions.  People with disabilities received strong support and were guaranteed access to services to ensure their full participation in the political  social and economic life of the country.  As part of efforts to improve gender equality  the Government aimed to provide full access to reproductive rights.  Population dynamics had to be integrated effectively into development policies  and efforts to do so were ongoing.  She stressed the importance of building sustainable cities and of strengthening urban-rural linkages. MOGES JENSEN  Minister for Trade and Development Cooperation of Denmark  said that the Cairo action plan had greatly improved the lives of many people  but many were still left behind.  Human rights and sexual and reproductive health and rights for all were preconditions for ending poverty and ensuring sustainable development.  It was vital to end unwanted pregnancies  maternal deaths  female genital mutilation  and child and forced marriage.  The index report showed that Governments had determined that universal access to integrated sexual and reproductive health must be a priority in the post-2015 development agenda  and that such access was vital for poverty reduction and sustainable development.  Comprehensive sex education would go a long way to address unplanned pregnancies.  To end unnecessary deaths due to unsafe abortion  abortion must be legal and safe.  Denmark would continue to strongly support the Cairo action plan.  Gender equality and women's empowerment must be central to the post-2015 development agenda. SALIM MUSLIMOV  Minister for Labour and Social Protection of Azerbaijan  emphasizing the economic difficulties resulting from Armenia's occupation of his country’s territory  said that the Cairo goals had been incorporated into the national economic policy.  Citing Azerbaijan’s socio-demographic successes  particularly with regard to increased life expectancy  he noted that a new population policy was being prepared that would consolidate the good results to date.  He expressed hope that today's generations would set a programme of action beyond 2015  which would be as inclusive as possible. TOMMY REMENGESAU  President of Palau  said that over the past decade his country had achieved a near no-growth rate  had achieved the Millennium Development Goals  and demonstrated a consistent path towards sustainable development.  Yet  the pollution of the oceans  the atmosphere and the overall quality of life caused by overpopulation of the planet during the last century had impacted the small nations of the Pacific  which did not have large populations  but did have densely populated areas.  That challenged the water supply  sanitation and solid waste management  among other things  and led to difficulties at the social  commodity  agricultural  cultural and environmental levels.  Thus  those countries too faced the problems of population increase. Until we face the problem of increased population  we are all rowing our canoes in circles  he said.  It was necessary to come to terms with population growth or face disaster.  If the world’s population stopped growing  there could be real sustainable development  protection of human rights  a moderation of biodiversity loss  improved medical capacity  improved mortality rates and rational planning for national  regional and global platforms.  Overpopulation was the greatest challenge and impacted all other global challenges.  It was time to face the elephant in our closet and make the reduction of the global population growth a primary goal of the United Nations. ANDRIS PIEBALGS  European Commissioner for Development  the European Union Delegation  said that  in the past 20 years  the Union had strongly promoted human rights and anti-discrimination  gender equality and women's empowerment  all of which were needed for development.  It had provided considerable support for implementing the Cairo action plan in the areas of education  health care  safe drinking water and sanitation.  Such efforts had benefited millions of people.  To eradicate poverty more effectively  development policies must be holistic in nature.  The European Union remained committed to promoting  protecting and fulfilling human rights  and to effectively implementing the Cairo and Beijing action programmes and the outcomes of their respective review conferences.  Universal access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health should be a high priority on the post-2014 development agenda. PASCALE BOISTARD  Secretary of State for Women’s Rights of France  pointed to the negative consequences of restricting sexual and reproductive rights for women  noting that annually 50 000 women died and 8 million were affected by complications and infections due to unsafe abortions.  Her Government had acknowledged women's reproductive and sexual rights  integrating them into national laws.  She supported all efforts to ensure such rights and to education for boys and girls.  Those rights should be incorporated into the post-2015 development agenda. JEAN ASSELBORN  Minister for Foreign and European Affairs of Luxembourg  recalled that the eradication of poverty remained the fundamental objective of any development effort  but must be fair and universal.  Voicing support for sexual and reproductive rights  he stressed that gender equality was a cross-cutting priority for his Government  which supported a number of specific projects  particularly in the fight against gender-based violence and female genital mutilation  among others.  Furthermore  health service should be available to all  regardless of economic or social status  and with women having access to sexual and reproductive health without discrimination or stigma.  In addition  urbanization must be addressed through sustainable development solutions  which also incorporated a balance between migration and respect for human rights and the fundamental freedoms of migrants. BRUNO RODRÍGUEZ PARRILLA  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba  said that world population growth could be seen in the developing countries  but that wealth was increasingly concentrated in the developed countries.  The gap between developed and developing countries and between rich and poor had widened.  Poverty denied populations in the South a decent life.  The richest countries were plundering the non-renewable resources of the planet.  The Cuban revolution assured human rights  including the right to sexual health.  However  implementation of the national programme to follow-up on the Cairo agreement and the complete national strategy for population dynamics was severely affected by the genocidal blockade against the Cuban people pursued by consecutive United States administrations. GERD MÜLLER  Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany  said that complications during pregnancy and childbirth were among the most frequent causes of death in developing countries.  In 2013  such complications killed about 300 000 women worldwide.  Furthermore  200 million women in developing countries still had no access to modern birth control.  Women still suffered from violence and genital mutilation.  Women and young girls were still forced into marriage.  We must not accept that.  Gender equality  no violence — not just on paper  but in real life.  That is what we stand for; that is what we are fighting for  he said.  Voicing support for reproductive and sexual rights for women  he said that Germany had provided $4.3 billion over the last 20 years to help implement the Cairo Action Programme. SÉKOU TRAORÉ  Minister for Planning of Guinea  associating himself with the African Group  expressed gratitude to the international community for its support on the Ebola outbreak.  Approximately 52 per cent of Guinea's population were women  with 14 per cent having undergone female genital mutilation  and many dying in childbirth.  In addition  there had been significant migration from rural areas  due to land degradation.  Yet  the population was increasing by millions  making it difficult to find solutions to food security and numerous other problems.  However  the status of women was improving  with better health services  especially in the area of reproductive health.  More girls were going to school.  Investing in social programmes required more investment from the international community and development partners.  Expressing support for the major programmes of the Cairo action plan  he said that the changing role of Africa must be considered in formulating sustainable development goals. ARNOLD NICHOLSON  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Jamaica  said that development and protection of human capital  economic stability  competitiveness and employment should be prioritized in the Cairo action plan and that environmental resilience and appropriate climate change responses should be promoted.  Jamaica had been at the forefront of population and development activities in Latin America and the Caribbean.  He voiced support for the implementation of the 1994 Cairo action plan  not the renegotiating of existing agreements.  The review had revealed that Jamaica had made progress in more than 80 per cent of the 110 issues explored.  His country had substantially reduced its population growth  mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS and related deaths  and infant and maternal mortality  while making progress towards gender equality and women's empowerment. GUNNAR BRAGI SVEINSSON  Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iceland  said that the world agreed that sustainable development was not just about counting people  but making every person count.  That included empowering women  providing access to sexual and reproductive health care  and promoting human rights  among other things.  Furthermore  the promises from Cairo must be central to the formation of the post-2015 sustainable development goals.  We don't need new commitments — we need to fulfil what we committed to do in Cairo  he stated  underscoring that such a commitment would ensure the human rights of all and make every person count. HASNA BARKAT DAOUD  Minister for the Promotion of Women of Djibouti  said her country had achieved education parity at the primary level.  Its HIV/AIDS prevalence  at 2.7 per cent  had been stable since 2003.  HIV screening was free.  Infant mortality had dropped from 140 deaths per 1 000 live births to 90 per 1 000 live births in 2010.  The Government was in the process of setting up a free health-care system for everyone.  In 2007  a national initiative for social development had been launched.  A women's solidarity fund had been exclusively financed from development funds.  Women's empowerment was a pillar of the nation's development vision.  Women's economic empowerment was included in the 2011 national gender policy.  A family planning strategy was now being developed.  Several international and regional conferences on ending female genital mutilation had been held in Djibouti.  The most barbaric form of it was no longer practised in her country. JULIE BISHOP  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia  noting that women and children bore the brunt of increasingly violent conflict and protracted humanitarian crises around the world  underscored that the Cairo Programme of Action was as relevant as it was 20 years ago.  Progress made must be protected and the rights of women and girls advanced.  While maternal mortality rates had dropped by 50 per cent in her country’s region  challenges remained.  Protecting women from violence  promoting their economic empowerment and supporting their leadership in the family  community  business and politics were priorities for Australia  both domestically and through its diplomacy and aid.  Elaborating the many ways in which Australia provided support to furthering women’s and girls’ rights through various United Nations bodies  she said that 80 per cent of her Government’s development aid required a gender equality focus. SODNOMZUNDUI ERDENE  Minister for Population of Mongolia  pointed to reduced infant mortality  improved maternal health and limited spread of HIV/AIDS in his country.  Population and development issues were integrated into national development documents  which recognized human rights and sexual and reproductive rights.  The Millennium Development Goals were incorporated at the State policy level as the basis of a Comprehensive National Development Strategy.  Parliament had approved a green development policy to decrease ecosystem degradation  ensure inclusive participation and reduce poverty.  Sexuality education had also been integrated in secondary schools.  The number of women politicians had tripled  illustrating the effectiveness of strategies to improve gender equality and empower women  while laws against domestic violence and protective children’s rights had also been enacted.  Following the sixth Asia-Pacific Population Conference  a national high-level meeting on population and development had approved the Ulaanbaatar Declaration. NGUYEN THI KIM TIEN  Minister for Health of Viet Nam  said that  in the past 20 years  her country had made considerable progress in implementing the Cairo action plan.  Public health had significantly improved  particularly in sexual and reproductive health.  From 1990 to 2010  maternal mortality fell by 75 per cent  and infant mortality fell by more than 50 per cent.  From 1994 to 2013  the fertility rate dropped by half and contraceptive prevalence increased by 13 per cent.  Viet Nam was one of the few countries in the world on track to achieve the fourth and fifth Millennium target.  In the coming years  the Government would develop appropriate policies that addressed ageing population  migration and urbanization and gender inequality  and further strengthen its health-care system to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health. MAXINE MCCLEAN  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados  said the impact of the Cairo Programme of Action was evident in the decrease in family size  increased participation of women in the formal workforce  and delayed childbearing.  Comprehensive  quality sexual and reproductive health-care services were provided through Barbados' free health-care system.  The unmet need for contraceptives had been reduced in the general population  and legislation allowed for the safe termination of pregnancies.  The maternal death rate stood at 0.8 per 1 000 live births.  The Barbados Family Planning Association had aggressive programmes to reduce teen pregnancy.  A comprehensive HIV/AIDS programme was evidence-informed  gender-sensitive and human rights-based.  Anti-retroviral treatment was free.  The rate of mother to child transmission had been maintained at 2 per cent or less in the last 10 years. LI BIN  Minister for National Health and Family Planning Commission of China  said her Government had implemented family planning to control the excessive population growth.  Life expectancy had increased from 69 years of age in the 1990s to 75 years of age today.  The under-five mortality target already had been achieved.  The relationship between economic and social development and the population factor had become closer.  China's current population and development policy was based on an integrated approach to decision-making and entailed follow-up on family planning initiatives and strategies.  China provided health-care services for rural women  especially for screening of breast cancer.  Her country was committed to providing equal access to basic services for migrants  and improving the social security system.  It was committed to incorporating sexual and reproductive health and family planning into all services  and issues of population into the post-2015 development agenda. SARTAJ AZIZ  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Pakistan  said that his country  the sixth most populous country in the world  was on track to become the fifth-most populous.  That demonstrated his Government’s major focus on population matters  including population policies enacted in 2001 and 2002  among other major population initiatives.  Since 1994  many achievements had been made in public health  particularly in the area of reproductive health.  Despite such successes  there were still many challenges  especially in the gap of access to services between rich and poor.  His country  nonetheless  was committed to the Millennium Development Goals  and to providing reproductive health to women country-wide in accordance with the Constitution  as well as to the many other population-related initiatives. LUIS ALMAGRO  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay  detailed his country's many successes in poverty reduction  decreasing of infant mortality and the integration of sexual and reproductive health services  among other areas  as well as to the centrality of human rights particularly for the most vulnerable  among others.  He also singled out Uruguay's law permitting same-sex marriage and noted programmes on ethnic and gender equality.  Delineating the many international commitments Uruguay had made  including regionally  where agreements had gone beyond the Cairo Programme of Action  he called for the conclusions and recommendations of the Secretary-General's report to be included in the post-2015 development agenda. URMAS PAET  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Estonia  said his country was actively promoting women's rights  gender equality and education  as well as including women in conflict prevention and sexual and reproductive health-care services into its national strategies.  Since 2010  Estonia had launched programmes towards that end valued at €165 million.  In 2014  Estonia funded several development aid projects focused on education for women and girls  and two national non-governmental organizations were working on improving education overseas.  In Yemen  Estonia was supporting plans to end child marriages.  In Kyrgyzstan  it was working on raising knowledge about reproductive health.  The principle aims of the Cairo Programme of Action should be the cornerstones of the post-2015 development agenda. CAROLYN RODRIGUES-BIRKETT  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guyana  said that her country’s priorities were poverty eradication  improving social services  gender equality  women’s empowerment and equal opportunity.  Particular attention was given to the elderly and the most vulnerable.  Progress had been made  thanks to the support of its partners.  Much remained to be done towards investing in young people  particularly with regard to the creation of apprenticeships.  Another serious dilemma for Guyana resulted from migration.  The country was making every effort to explore initiatives to encourage Guyanese overseas to return. SRI ROHANI ABDUL KARIM  Minister for Women  Family and Community Development of Malaysia  said that her country had achieved most of the goals of the Cairo action plan.  Malaysia had achieved significant poverty reduction and ensured wider coverage of health care and education services nationwide.  A plan was in place to increase women's participation in the workforce to 55 per cent by 2015.  More than half of micro businesses were owned by women.  With better educated women in the workforce  the country had set at 30 per cent the quota for women in decision-making posts in both the public and corporate sectors.  Thanks to an excellent health-care system  Malaysia had one of the lowest mortality rates among developing countries.  It had launched the 2011-2015 National Strategic Plan on HIV and AIDS and was the first country in Asia to introduce a HPV vaccination programme.  The national policy on reproductive health and social education  introduced in 2009  had increased access to such education  information and services for adolescents and youth.  The declining fertility rate would put Malaysia  by 2030  in the category of nation in which the elderly comprised more than 15 per cent of the population. CARLOS MORALES TRONCOSO  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Dominican Republic  said the adoption of the Cairo action plan had expanded the rights of persons in his country  contributed to raising awareness on matter relating to human development  and had influenced constitutional reforms in 2010.  The Government had focused on people in all public policies.  With 38 of every 100 Dominicans under the age of 30  it was necessary to access that demographic group in regards to poverty.  A third of the population lived in unacceptable conditions  with some living on just $1.25 per day.  Gains had been made  however  in addressing health care for women and reducing maternal and child mortality.  The Dominican Republic was also working to help its neighbour  Haiti  by building three hospitals close to the border. JOHN BAIRD  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada  said that sustainable progress would only be achieved if the international community worked on population  human rights  sustainable economic growth and sustainable development together.  Those interrelationships required attention.  By addressing issues holistically and recognizing their interdependence  progress would be achieved and contributed.  Speaking holistically  one could not talk about child health without also taking about ending child  early and forced marriages  because the two were interconnected.  As well  education and equal rights for boys and girls was a cornerstone of development.  Giving children a legal identity through civil registration helped them access services such as health care and education  protected them from exploitation and abuse  and as they became adults  enabled them to be part of the formal economy. DUNYA MAUMOON  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Maldives  said her country was a success story  the third to graduate from the list of least developed countries to middle-income status.  She described how Government policies had helped realization of five out of eight Millennium Development Goals  with the other three on course for completion by 2015.  Despite progress  development was far from complete.  Income was unequally distributed; women  while enjoying high a level of equality relative to the region  had limited opportunity for economic empowerment and gender-based violence remained an issue.  A gender equality law would establish a legal framework to combat discrimination.  With 44 per cent of the population counted as youth  tackling unemployment was key.  She looked forward to the results of a national census  which would paint a picture of the population and allow the Government to take action on issues including protecting the rights of migrant workers. HILLEVI ENGSTRÖM  Minister for International Development Cooperation of Sweden  associating herself with the European Union  said the Cairo agreement was a remarkable one  but its objectives needed to be reaffirmed.  She was concerned with the situation of women  noting that 800 women died every day in avoidable circumstances.  One in three women had experienced physical or sexual abuse  with 125 million women suffering from female genital mutilation.  True sustainable development depended on women's active participation.  Under the Stockholm Statement of Commitment  States promised to protect human rights  eliminate discrimination  and establish a minimum legal age of marriage.  Gender equality had to be a standalone goal within the post-2015 development agenda  with an emphasis on human rights  including the right to sexual education  health care  contraception and abortion  as well as protection against forced marriage. CECILIA VACA  Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of Ecuador  said that her country was firmly committed to eradicating poverty by 2017.  Basic education was already universal in Ecuador  and her country was implementing a family planning initiative to decrease unwanted pregnancies.  National public policies for social and economic matters focused on human beings over capital  to generate opportunities from an early age.  It was necessary to decrease adolescent pregnancy  reduce gender inequality  and focus on redistribution and compensation for paid and unpaid work at home.  The world order was unjust and immoral  and the international community needed to change it MICHEL BLOKLAND  Minister for Health of Suriname  said that  today  more than ever  the principles agreed upon in Cairo in 1994 remained particularly relevant  especially from the human rights and gender perspective.  In that regard  the international community should continue to invest in human capital  equity and dignity throughout the life-course as the foundation of sustained economic growth and sustainable development for everybody.  Most notably  that included adolescents  women  men  children  youth  persons with disabilities  indigenous peoples and other disadvantaged and marginalized groups.  It was crucial that the international community agree on an ambitious future development framework that was inclusive and which put people at the centre of development.  He stressed the importance of mobilizing domestic resources in efforts to achieve sustainable development and improve the well-being of populations. OLEH MUSIY  Minister for Healthcare of Ukraine  said that his country recognized the significant positive results that had been achieved in the past 20 years  with a significant reduction in unwanted pregnancies  abortions  and child and maternal mortality.  Youth now lived a more conscious way of life.  The stable development of countries could only be achieved through investing in individuals.   Ukraine had one of the oldest populations in the world  and he asked donor countries to contribute to UNFPA initiatives for aging populations  both globally and in Ukraine.  Planet Earth was the common home  and wars and natural disasters concerned everyone.  Thus  the world needed to make common efforts towards peace and security for each and every person on Earth. G. L. PEIRIS  Minister for External Affairs of Sri Lanka  said the Cairo Programme of Action recognized the centrality of population dynamics to development in the twenty-first century.  A Reproductive and Population Policy had passed in 1998 and a national Maternal and Child Health Policy in 2013  both aimed at integrating the Cairo agreement into policy.  Sri Lanka looked forward to 2041 when its working population would be 60 per cent of its entire population.  Development strategies were people-centric and socially sustainable  with the Millennium Development Goals integrated into them.  Achievements stemming from the strategies showed no gender disparity.  New challenges were on the horizon as population dynamics altered  including non-communicable diseases and an ageing population.  Thirty-nine per cent of the health budget was devoted to combating non-communicable diseases and a comprehensive prevention programme had been launched. PHANDU SKELEMANI  Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Botswana  pointed to public health interventions made following the Cairo agreement  which contributed to achieving a reduced fertility rate as part of the National Population Policy.  Focus had since fallen on increasing access to general health care and addressing inequalities in access to sexual and reproductive services.  Comprehensive sexuality education was provided in schools  and access to sexual and reproductive health and HIV/AIDS services was increasing nationwide.  He was committed to universal access to HIV prevention  treatment  care and support  and elimination of mother-to-child transmissions.  He pointed to Botswana's youthful population structure and the attendant challenges  including ensuring provision of quality education and skills development  to match the demands in the job market.  The youth bulge also created opportunities  and the Government was identifying strategies to take advantage of that demographic dividend.  Noting that Botswana's middle-income country status had led to declining donor support  an effort was needed to galvanize development partner support to help implement the Programme of Action beyond 2014. OLGA MARTA SANCHEZ OVIEDO  Minister for Planning and Economic Policy of Costa Rica  said that since 1994  her country had made significant progress on the Programme of Action  combating violence against women  HIV/AIDS and defending the rights of children  adolescents and older adults.  For two decades  the Government had been making sustained efforts to ensure laws  policies  programs and projects could help achieve the necessary goals  working relentlessly to combat poverty and exclusion that affected a fifth of the population of Costa Rica  and to protect biodiversity and ecosystems  which was a natural wealth of the people.  Discussions of the post-2014 agenda was a good opportunity to discuss how to tackle the significant challenges that still lay before the international community. JEAN-PASCAL LABILLE  Minister of Cooperation and Development of Belgium  said that targeted investment towards youth  particularly education and sexual education  was key.  Inequalities persisted  and it was necessary to adopt an integrated approach that included all individuals without discrimination.  However there was a gap when it came to young people.  It was important to take into account the interaction between population dynamics  environment and sustainable development  and for Governments to work together with civil society and the United Nations to achieve the necessary goals. MERCEDES DEL CARMEN GUILLÉN VICENTE  Minister for Population  Migration and Religious Affairs of Mexico  said her country had reduced poverty and inequalities over recent years.  Needed structural reform had been implemented under the new Government.  The new social policy meant substantial changes  including a national crusade against hunger and efforts to tackle poverty.  Despite challenges remaining  the goal of quality universal primary education had been fulfilled  and women were being empowered.  In addition  good progress had been made on drinking water and sanitation  as well as on preventing deforestation. MONGI HAMDI  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tunisia  stressed the importance of sex education for girls and boys  as well as reproductive health.  Combating violence against women and girls was essential  as was the achievement of gender equality.  Tunisia had included the Cairo action plan in its national policies and programmes  submitting regular reports  including the latest  which came in the context of Cairo+20.  However  disparities remained  and structural differences were to blame.  Despite the political transition  republican principles had been strengthened and economic progress had been achieved. SAMURA M. W. KAMARA  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sierra Leone  said that his country had made progress according to its 2013 Demographic and Health Survey  despite the dark shadow being cast by the recent outbreak of Ebola  for which the country was ill-prepared.  Positive strides had included a decrease in fertility rates due to modern family planning  and antenatal care by skilled birth attendants increased from 87 per cent to 97 per cent.  Additionally  the use of insecticide treated nets had doubled for children under five from 26 per cent to 49 per cent  reducing malaria infection.  Sierra Leone knew it needed to scale up its efforts to reduce maternal and childhood mortality  and had thus introduced free health-care services for pregnant women. CÉLESTIN VUNABANDI KANYAMIHIGO  Minister for Planning and Monitoring of the Implementation of the Revolution Modernity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  said that efforts in his country had turned more towards peacemaking.  Maternal and child health had improved  and significant progress had been made in reducing maternal mortality.  Between 2001 and 2012  significant progress was made in primary education  which now had many more girls involved than before.  Gender equality had been the subject of great attention under international legal frameworks  and rape and other crimes against women and girls had been criminalized.  The Government was collaborating with civil society and the private sector  and was in favour of the post-2014 agenda being inclusive in order to combat discrimination in all its forms. SIMBARASHE MUMBENGEGWI  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Zimbabwe  said that his Government had used the Programme of Action it to make significant progress in achieving development.  Migration and urbanization had had a great impact on Zimbabwe's population dynamics  and were major development challenges.  Urban population growth put great pressure on infrastructure  like water and energy supplies  and sanitation  the development of which lagged behind.  The Government’s efforts paid significant attention to the human rights underpinnings of the Cairo action plan.  In combating HIV/AIDS  he believed it was important to share crucial lessons about strengthening health systems.  Maternal mortality rates remained unacceptably high  as did infant mortality  and more work was needed to ensure pregnancy and motherhood did not remain a death trap for women. MAIKIBI KADIDIATOU  Minister for Population  Women's Protection and Child Protection of Niger  said the Secretary-General's report emphases clicked with her country's national priorities  including human rights  especially in relation to reproductive health and sex education  as well as the elimination of violence against women and girls.  Using the report  States could better develop the post-2015 development agenda.  Twenty years after the conference  Niger had achieved a lot  but faced the great challenge of strong population growth of 3.9 per cent per year.  That rate pointed to a doubling of the population over 18 years.  To tackle that  economic growth and efforts were taking advantage of the demographic dividend.  She had high expectations for the post-2015 development agenda and underlined the need to develop programmes that accounted for the social and cultural diversities of the world's various countries. SANDRA EDIBEL GUEVARA PÉREZ  Minister for Labour of El Salvador  said so many aspirations for personal and collective development  as laid out in 1994  could be beneficial so long as individual dignity was maintained.  That was without a doubt the basis in order to achieve sustainable development.  Her country was grateful for the opportunity to participate in the review process.  There was now a national plan to achieve substantive equality to guarantee the mainstreaming of gender in public policy  and her country had enacted a comprehensive law for a life free of violence.  It was important to ensure the rights of women  including having power over their own bodies  without discrimination. BATHABILE DLAMINI  Minister for Social Development of South Africa  said that  as her country celebrated its new democracy  it  nevertheless  remembered its past when discrimination was a reality.  The recent 20-year review of ICDP pointed out the huge gaps with regards to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all women and girls.  It was critical for this special session to take note of the Program of Action and that further actions were required  including through the upcoming intergovernmental discussions on the post-2015 agenda.  South Africa had improved access to women's health care  including access to safe abortion services.  The country's health department was improving programmes to prevent maternal mortality  and providing universal access to HIV prevention  care and support. South Africa had seen a dramatic rise in life expectancy  from 54 years in 2005 to 60 years in 2011. Speaking on a point of order  the representative of Belarus said he addressed himself to all delegations with an appeal to stick to the established procedure and the established speaking time  which was three minutes.  The President had called on all delegations to do that more than once.  Many delegates had come from far away to take part in this meeting  and all must demonstrate respect by not going over their allotted time. KESETEBIRHAN ADMASU  Minister for Health of Ethiopia  said persistent gender inequality continued to hamper access to reproductive health and many harmful traditional practices still posed serious challenges to ensuring the well-being of women and girls.  The Cairo agreement agenda remained incomplete  and progress achieving it was uneven.  Currently  an incredible opportunity existed to continue with efforts to address population related challenges.  The National Population Policy  issued in 1993  had aimed to harmonize the rate of population growth with the country's capacity for development and resource use.  Its ultimate goal was raising the level of welfare of the population over time.  Major efforts went into giving full access to reproductive health including family planning.  Uptake of family planning services had improved from 3 per cent in 1990 to 40 per cent in 2014.  Measures had also been implemented to advance women and promote gender equity.  A wide gender gap in education had narrowed as equal access was provided and revisions to laws were key in preventing harmful traditional practices. EMERINE KABANSHI  Minister for Community Development  Mother and Child Health of Zambia  reiterated support for views expressed in the context of the Africa regional review of implementation of the International Conference on Population and Development.  Her country had made progress on reducing HIV prevalence  maternal and infant mortality  improving empowerment of women and youth  and on primary school enrolment.  Challenges remained in providing universal access to sexual and reproductive health information and services  high teenage pregnancy rates  reduction of poverty and economic inequality.  Policies including the Citizen Economic Empowerment Fund and Youth Development Fund aimed at advancing the social status of women and young people.  A National Strategy for Development of Statistics had been established to lay a foundation for evidence-based decision-making in the implementation of Government strategies. FATMA FEREJ  Minister for State of the United Republic of Tanzania  said her country had made good progress on reproductive and sexual health  child morbidity and mortality  and education.  In addition  it had made significant achievements on the second  third and fourth Millennium Development Goals well before 2015.  Despite remarkable improvements  however  there were still challenges in other areas.  Twelve million Tanzanians were still living below the poverty line  contributing to child marriages.  High numbers of maternal deaths were still a problem.  The national priority needed focus on poverty eradication  sex education and empowerment of youth  especially girls. NATALIA PEDRO DA COSTA UMBELINA NETO  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Community of Sao Tome and Principe  said that the establishment of comprehensive services for sexual and reproductive health for young people was important.  Her country was aware of the challenges which must be met in order to improve the quality of life for the population and protect the environment.  Much remained to be done to satisfy basic needs  such as access to decent work  social protection  and health and education services.  Human rights and equality were the basis of the analytic focus of the Secretary-General's report. MARIO LOPES DA ROSA  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guinea-Bissau  said participation in the global survey was a chance to take stock of progress in implementation of the Programme of Action.  Much remained to be done to ensure equality and equity and the protection of the environment.  His country had an ambitious national agenda  based on a single national effort.  He agreed that the challenges of development required engagement of all stakeholders and the United Nations was important in achieving that.  He supported the regional action plan. ALOHA NUÑES  Minister for Indigenous Affairs of Venezuela  said her Government had implemented a national campaign to eradicate extreme poverty.  It had been accompanied by macro social policies on health  nutrition  education  social security and peaceful coexistence.  The goal was to be free of extreme poverty by 2019.  On gender equality and equity  a legal framework had been established to put Venezuela at the forefront of protection and promotion of rights of women.  An institutional infrastructure was in place to promote equality around the country.  A new law had been promulgated for equality of people with HIV/AIDS that eliminated all forms of discrimination against people with those diseases and those associated with them.  Many challenges existed and it was important to see the Millennium Development Goals as departure points for future development  not as arrival points. MOUKOKO MBONJO  Minister for External Relations of Cameroon  asked what stock could be taken of the Cairo Programme of Action  and what goals could be set for the next 20 years.  His country sought to make its national population policy in line with the Cairo Programme  focusing on the correlation between population and development.  His Government had focused on sexual and reproductive health  which had improved social indicators and led to a reduction in inequalities between men and women.  Improvements in education and reducing maternal mortality had been made possible due to a successful system of monitoring of the Cairo Programme.  It was essential that every child should be brought up by a mother and a father who could provide them with a quality education.  The family unit should be the centre of society  with both spouses as consenting and equal partners. NESTORINE SANGARÉ COMPAORÉ  Minister for the Advancement of Women and Gender of Burkina Faso  said there was now greater gender parity in schools  and inclusive economic growth within the framework of sustainable development were priority goals in decreasing poverty and pay inequality.  There needed to be further efforts made to reduce maternal and child mortality  which was still at 340 deaths per 10 000 live births.  It was also necessary to provide young couples with access to family planning information.  Access of young people  particularly women  was a priority.  To reduce their poverty  their vulnerability was also reduced.  Together  with the international community  efforts must be continued  intensified and updated. OMAR SEY  Minister for Health and Social Welfare of the Gambia  supported the principles of universal access to reproductive health and services including HIV/AIDS  and that women be given the right to decide the timing and number of children they wished to have.  The country's development policies upheld the right of young people to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health information and services  taking steps to integrate women's and youth issues into the health and national population policies and the Programme for Accelerated Growth and Employment.  He singled out significant improvement in girls’ education and women's empowerment among other achievements since 1994.  The country participated in South-South cooperation through sharing technology  skills and best practices in reproductive health  population and development.  Among challenges remaining were population density  which  left unchecked could pose challenges of environmental sustainability and agricultural production.  Unless the international community fulfilled its funding commitments towards population and development issues  developing countries would find it difficult to tackle challenges posed by their populations  especially the youthful generation. PHILLIP MULLER  Minister for Health of the Marshall Islands  said there were serious hurdles to the country's development  among them great population density and vulnerability to climate change.  The country's three-year development plan cut across all sectors.  Reproductive health was already in motion  but help was needed for more targeted support.  Even though progress had been made  such as in senior positions in civil service  women must be better represented throughout society.  In the face of large global structures  such as the post-2015 development agenda  small island nations were sometimes left behind in a one-size-fits-all approach.  The recent meeting in Samoa was a step in the right direction. FULBERT AMOUSSOUGA GERO  Minister in Charge of Coordination of the Implementation of Policies related to the Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals of Benin  supported the Cairo Programme of Action and said that his country had worked to implement it through national education  health-care and gender equality strategies.  His Government ran programmes to help people living with HIV/AIDS  victims of sexual violence and harassment and victims of discrimination.  It was conducting research of tropical diseases  including the Ebola virus.  He called on developed countries to increase financial and technical support to enable developing countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. SAMEH SHOUKRY  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Egypt  said the Cairo Programme should continue to serve as a point of reference.  Article 49 of Egypt's Constitution put population concerns at the centre of sustainable development.  The Egypt 2013 economic development plan focused on issues related to girls' education  early and forced marriages  reproductive health and family planning.  Egypt hosted a regional review of the Cairo conference in 2013.  At it  participants unanimously adopted the Cairo Declaration and a shared vision of development for the region.  He called on development partners to honour their ODA commitments. HENRYKA MOŚCICKA-DENDYS  Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland  said her country had been working intensely in recent years to empower and support the independence of women  including through quotas on voting lists and some political parties.  For the past five years  Poland had seen a strong development of the independent women’s movement  and one of the most significant initiatives in that regard was the Congress of Women in which the most dynamic and successful Polish female leaders from political  social and economic circles met annually.  As for changing demographics  she said that Poland’s population was set to decrease by 1.3 million persons by 2030  and thus  negative changes in the age structure and labour shortages were to be expected. LAPO PISTELLI  Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Italy  said that more needed to be done to create sustainable growth.  Proper allocation of human and financial resources were necessary  not only to make sure that the largest generation of youth of all time would be able to meet its health needs  but also to ensure that the elderly were properly cared for.  Governments could better plan when they had accurate population data.  Systematic  coordinated actions from all stakeholders were needed.  In that context  the United Nations  and UNFPA in particular  could play an important role in formulating partnerships.  All individuals and all countries should be able to realize their full potential. JULIO ROJAS  Vice-Minister for Vulnerable Populations of Peru  stressed support for the Cairo action plan and its periodic reviews  and the importance of the 2013 Montevideo Consensus  which emphasized the need to protect human rights.  Poverty had been reduced by 30 per cent in Peru  thanks to programmes that spurred economic growth.  He cited the 2014-2016 national plan for human rights  and strategies to prevent teen pregnancy  end violence against women  prosecute violators of such violence  improve maternal health and expand maternity leave for new mothers  end femicide  and improve the rights of indigenous people. DIDIER BURKHALTER  Secretary for State of Switzerland  supported the vision that put women's rights at the centre of population and development.  Much remained to be done to realize the rights of women and girls and reduce maternal mortality.  An increased  rapid implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action was needed.  Priority must be given to quality education and to addressing the gender equity gap.  Young people must be able to make informed decisions about their future.  Access to sexual and reproductive health services was essential. SOMCHITH INTHAMITH  Vice-Minister for Planning and Investment of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  noted the relevance of the issues addressed in the Secretary-General's report to his country as it strove to graduate from least developed to middle-income country status by 2020.  Several strategic actions in the areas of health  education  youth issues and a national plan against violence against women had been undertaken.  He also stressed the importance of data collection  analysis and dissemination.  Strategic responses to development challenges required the participation of all stakeholders  as well as partnership and global leadership through the United Nations.  Population dynamics must be integrated into development planning at national  regional and international levels.  More needed to be done  including increased investment in young people and strengthening their participation in decision-making and planning; programmes to keep girls in school and to respond to violence against women and girls; addressing unmet needs for family planning; and increased efforts to ensure sustainable development. TOM ALWEENDO  Director-General of the National Planning Commission of Namibia  stressed the need to recommit to the Cairo action plan and to employ new strategies to implement it.  Namibia had ratified the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  It had launched campaigns to reduce maternal mortality and to improve reproductive health and gender equality.  It had increased family planning services.  It now had the lowest fertility rate in Africa and had witnessed a decline in teen pregnancy and HIV infection.  He stressed the need to integrate sexual and reproductive health services into national action strategies. DENG DENG HOC YAI  Minister for Environment of South Sudan  shared the urgency of addressing the Cairo review's finding on endemic poverty  hunger and the lack of access to public education and health services.  Investing in individual human rights  capabilities and dignity was the key to sustainable development.  Building human capacity for young people and giving them access to sexual and reproductive services had implications for human development.  Tackling development challenges today required the participation of all stakeholders.  South Sudan was committed to implementing the 2014 Addis Ababa Declaration on the Cairo Programme of Action. AHAMD JAN NEEM  Deputy Minister for Public Health of Afghanistan  pointed to a Reproductive Health Strategy 2012-2016 that was in line with the Programme of Action.  In addition  a Health and Human Rights Strategy had been developed.  The Ministry of Public Health had approved a patient charter and guidelines on medical ethics  and a medical council was being established.  Primary education enrolment rates were improving  with Afghanistan on course to achieve its target of 100 per cent enrolment by 2020.  His country was a State party to several core human rights treaties and had developed a National Action Plan for the Women of Afghanistan 2008-2017.  Twenty-seven per cent of legislators were women  with similar trends in law enforcement and the judiciary.  Pointing out that the National Youth Policy encouraged participation in peace and reconciliation and in policy and programme development  he noted that security remained a challenge  causing migration and the dispersal of refugees to Iran and Pakistan.  He also pointed to Afghanistan's achievements in access to media  with more than 40 private television channels and 100 radio stations  in addition to printed media. VALENTIN RYBAKOV  Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus  said the secret of the Cairo action plan’s success was a respect for national traditions and specificities.  However  the international community still had not resolved many issues in the Programme of Action.  It was fashionable to promote sexual rights  but was often based on a dangerous ideology that harmed family values and forcefully imposed behavioural models that were not supported around the world.  Families were the most important building block of society and were the guarantee for a prosperous State.  Strengthening families was essential to the priorities of Belarus. TEWODROS MELESSIE of the International Planned Parenthood Federation  stating he wanted to talk about hope  said that when he visited the projects aimed to assist women  sex workers or drug addicts  he asked one participant if she were God for one hour  what would she do?  She said she would give hope  because when a person had hope  they had peace and prosperity.  Hope was about young people being able to choose whom to marry and when.  When the Programme of Action was introduced  the world came together to protect individuals and family to be free through sexual and reproductive rights  and not subjected to pain and death.  It was humanity that was the centre of the international framework  not business or finance.  The world needed humanity that was full of hope and dignity  but 2 million in the developing world who wanted to control their fertility  could not.  Equality was not about meetings and empty words  but fighting for the lives of women and girls.  For women in every region  the future they wanted was here.  The 20-year review pointed where to go. PETER MANGITI  Principal Secretary  Ministry of Devolution and Planning of Kenya  said that fertility rates had declined  as had infant mortality.  HIV prevalence had been reduced by half  and free maternity services were introduced in all health care facilities.  The Government had put in place a programme for upgrading informal settlements  estimated to house about 60 per cent of the urban population.  The Constitution guaranteed reproductive health services for all Kenyans.  Corporate initiatives were also being implemented to better the lives of women and youth.  As always  the United Nations and the international community could count on Kenya to help implement the Programme of Action beyond 2014. GISELE NGONDO  Director of the Cabinet of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Congo  stressed the importance of responding collectively to the rapid increase in the world's population.  The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) had noted that 40 per cent of children under five years old lived on the African continent  a population which would double.  Africa deserved special attention because the demographic transition had to become an opportunity.  That was the challenge before States.  African countries had adopted a joint position that would focus on population and development going forward  feeding the ongoing dialogue and Programme beyond 2014.  Congo was an under-populated country  but its population growth rate of 3 per cent was very high.  It had major implications for development policy.  One of the main challenges was mastering the population growth to ensure it was an opportunity  not a threat.  His country was in a good position to respond positively and was working to empower youth and foster an environment of creativity and innovation. ANA CRISTINA GONZÁLEZ VÉLEZ of Red de Salud de Mujeres Latinoamericanas y del Caribe said her organization had been present 20 years ago  supporting the process and levels of negotiations.  She hoped that the review process would bring leaders of the world to consider people of every variety.  There could be no development without women  and despite progress on sexual and reproductive rights  many women lived under laws that penalized them.  What prevented women from making more rapid progress was patriarchy  she said  condemning that system.  My body  my territory  she stated. CATHERINE NYAMBURA of Action Health Incorporated  relaying the story of a young girl who had undergone multiple violations  including rape and HIV infection  pointed out that approximately 3.3 million girls in Africa were subjected to female genital mutilation each year.  Many also faced fistula and death through early pregnancy.  Africa was currently the youngest continent  and it was essential to invest in young people's health and well-being.  There was an opportunity to determine the Africa that the international community desired  including giving young girls what they wanted  which was dignity health and equality. SIVANANTHI THANINTHERIN of the Asia Pacific Resource Centre for Women said that the international community needed to be cognizant of the fact that sexual and reproductive rights were essential ingredients in achieving sustainable development.  Those rights were integral to individual autonomy.  Every individual must have the right to decide whom one can love  marry or have relations with  as well as when or if to have children.  She called attention to the fact that sexual and reproductive rights did not exist in isolation and voiced hope that Governments and all stakeholders would support the outcome document  and take it into the post-2015 agenda. DAREEN ABU LAIL  Global Youth Action Network  said the rights of young people were not being taken seriously.  Those rights and youth voices needed to be acknowledged.  If knowledge was power  why was it taboo to have knowledge of the body?  Around the Middle East and elsewhere  massive violations of human rights took a toll on young people.  They bore the consequences twice  once during the actual trauma and once when reliving them.  How was it possible to celebrate the Cairo action plan when terrible things were still happening around the world?  It was not enough to listen.  Action needed to be taken  as well. Taking the floor on a point of order  the representative of Brazil asked why non-governmental organizations had been put ahead of Member States.  There was high-level representation present from States and not all had had a chance to speak. Closing Remarks DENIS ANTOINE (Grenada)  Vice-President of the General Assembly  welcomed the discussion and the energy  enthusiasm and commitment from organizations  and enjoyed hearing support for the Programme of Action with many reiterating the recommendations within it.  The membership had spoken in a single determined voice  promising to tackle the challenges posed by population changes in the twenty-first century.  The world was at a turning point  with global progress uneven and a vast range of formidable challenges stood ahead  women's empowerment and gender inequality among them.  They needed to be addressed effectively because they were so important to development policy  so quick and decisive action was imperative. Before the meeting was officially closed  delegations requested the floor on a point of order. The representative of the Russian Federation asked why so many States who had inscribed to the list of speakers had been unable to do speak.  He asked the President to explain whether the session could be ended with so many still waiting to speak. The United States representative agreed with the Russian Federation and asked whether those unable to speak would be able to add their statements online. Echoing his counterpart  the representative of the Russian Federation asked for a clear explanation of the situation. Senegal’s representatives expressed surprise at the way the session had been conducted. Noting that the meeting had been extended by three hours and 37 minutes  Mr. ANTOINE urged States that had not had a chance to speak to deliver their statements to the Secretariat to be included in the verbatim report.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-09-22,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11554.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Committing to further advance the rights of indigenous peoples  global leaders today called for actions that would bridge the gap between promises and results at the first-ever international conference on that disadvantaged group. Unanimously adopting a landmark Outcome Document at the General Assembly gathering  known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples  Heads of State and Government  ministers and other representatives highlighted the importance of obtaining “free  prior and informed consent” from indigenous peoples on matters that affected them  including legislative measures and development projects. The text also underscored the United Nations’ role in promoting and protecting indigenous peoples’ rights  including in the development and implementation of national action plans  strategies or other measures that affect them  in order to achieve the objectives of the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Today’s Document also urged intensified efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence and discrimination against the most vulnerable among that population  especially people with disabilities  youth  children  women and older persons. Further to the text  the Secretary-General was requested to begin the development of a system-wide action plan within existing resources to ensure a coherent approach to achieving the Declaration’s goals and to report to the General Assembly on the matter at its seventieth session.  He was also invited  by the end of that session  to appoint a United Nations senior official  with access to the highest levels of decision-making within the system  to coordinate the action plan and raise awareness of indigenous peoples’ rights. The Secretary-General was also asked  by that session  to report on the Outcome Document’s implementation and to make recommendations on how to use  modify and improve existing United Nations mechanisms to achieve the Declaration’s objectives  as well as ways to enhance a coherent  system-wide approach.  The text also asked for specific proposals to enable the participation of indigenous peoples’ representatives and institutions on issues that affected them. Addressing the meeting prior to adoption of the text  the Secretary-General said that while meeting recently with Maori leaders in New Zealand  he was impressed by their multimillion dollar horticulture  waste management and energy production companies and how every bit of waste was fed to worms  which  in turn  created very rich organic fertilizer.  That was “sustainability in action”  which could be replicated elsewhere.  The Outcome Document contained commitments to actions that would bridge the gap between promises and results  he said  welcoming the direct requests made to him. Also in opening remarks  Sam Kutesa  General Assembly President  said indigenous peoples’ issues had been a preoccupation of the United Nations for more than 30 years.  The Assembly’s 2007 adoption of the Declaration represented a “global consensus” on those peoples’ rights  including that of self-determination.  But with a deep chasm still separating reality from commitments  policies  and legislative actions  the Outcome Document comprised many action-oriented commitments directed towards addressing the implementation gaps. Enrique Peña Nieto  President of Mexico  speaking on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean Group  described the final document as “a road map to reposition indigenous peoples” in the United Nations agenda. Evo Morales Ayma  President of Bolivia  noting that the fundamental principles of indigenous peoples were life  Mother Earth and peace  said that those were threatened by the capitalist system.  In Bolivia  the indigenous movement was now able  not only to vote  but also govern.  Climate change had become one of the most serious problems facing the planet  and the best way to fight it was to base action on the experiences of indigenous peoples  as they knew how to live in harmony with Mother Earth. Zeid Ra’ad Al-Hussein  United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  spotlighted some statistics that suggested that indigenous peoples were more vulnerable to human rights violations.  Developed countries had a disproportionately high percentage of indigenous people in prison  he said  noting that  in one country  indigenous children were 25 times more likely to be in detention than children elsewhere. The Conference held two round-table discussions this afternoon on  respectively  “United Nations system action for the implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples” and “implementing the rights of indigenous peoples at the national and local level”. Also delivering statements in the opening session were Sauli Niinistö  President of Finland (on behalf of the Western European and Other Group); Toomas Hendrik Ilves  President of Estonia (on behalf of the Group of Eastern European States); Henri Djombo  Minister of Forest Economy and Sustainable Development of the Congo (on behalf of the Group of African States); Oren Lyons  Jr.  Chief of the Onondaga Nation Council of Chiefs; Aili Keskitalo  President of the Saami Parliament of Norway; Luis Evelis  Member of the Senate of Colombia; Dalee Sambo Dorough  Chairperson of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues; and Rigoberta Menchú  indigenous leader and Nobel Laureate. Speaking after adoption of the Outcome Document were an observer for the Holy See and the representative of Canada. Chief Sidd Hill of the Haudenosaunee opened the meeting with a traditional prayer. The Conference will meet again tomorrow at 3 p.m. for its conclusion. Opening Remarks SAM KUTESA  General Assembly President  said indigenous peoples’ issues had been a preoccupation of the United Nations for more than 30 years.  The General Assembly’s 2007 adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples represented a “global consensus” on those peoples’ rights  including that of self-determination. Nevertheless  he said  a deep chasm still separated reality from commitments  policies  and legislative actions aiming to improve the lives of indigenous peoples.  Today’s World Conference should serve as “a turning point” for translating the Declaration into concrete action.  The carefully crafted Outcome Document  which includes a system-wide action plan to ensure coherence in efforts towards realizing the Declaration’s provisions  comprises many action-oriented commitments directed towards addressing the implementation gaps  he said  adding that Member States must make greater efforts to translate it into reality. BAN KI-MOON  Secretary-General of the United Nations  said that today’s conference connected so much of the Organization’s critical work this week.  Indigenous peoples were concerned about issues that topped the global agenda and were deeply connected to Mother Earth  whose future was at the heart of the Climate Summit opening tomorrow.  Indigenous peoples were also central to human rights and global development discourse.  In talks with indigenous leaders in Costa Rica  he had found that they were worried about land  resources and rights.  He pledged to address the exclusion and marginalization facing indigenous peoples worldwide. Also  while meeting with Maori leaders in New Zealand earlier in the month  he had been impressed by their multi-million dollar horticulture  waste-management and energy-production companies and how every bit of waste was fed to worms  which  in turn  created very rich organic fertilizer.  That was “sustainability in action”  he said  adding that it showed what could be learned from indigenous peoples.  The General Assembly had adopted the Declaration during his first year in office.  That text had set minimum standards for the survival  well-being and dignity of indigenous peoples; it had also led more countries to reflect those principles in their laws and constitutions and increasingly encouraged United Nations agencies to develop specific policies. The Outcome Document before the Assembly today contained commitments to actions that would bridge the gap between promises and results  he said  welcoming its direct requests to him  including the development of concrete proposals to enable indigenous peoples and their institutions to participate more directly in United Nations activities.  He said he would also give serious consideration to a request to appoint a high-level official on indigenous peoples.  Quoting a long-time indigenous activist  he said that indigenous peoples  despite many different languages spoken among their communities  were speaking one language  and their relationship to Mother Earth was identical. EVO MORALES AYMA  President of Bolivia  said that the fundamental principles of indigenous peoples were life  Mother Earth  and peace.  Those tenets  however  were being threatened by the capitalist system  he said  adding that he was here today at the first official summit of the United Nations on indigenous peoples to share some experiences from his tenure in Bolivia. In Bolivia  he said  the indigenous movement was now able not only to vote but also govern.  Natural resources from Mother Earth should benefit everyone  he said  adding that in Bolivia  revenue from oil sales had doubled after the industry was nationalized.  With nationalization  Bolivia had freed itself from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank  which had determined the country’s economic policies.  Climate change had become one of the most serious problems facing the planet  he said  asserting that the best way to fight it was to base action on the experiences of indigenous peoples  who knew how to live in harmony with Mother Earth.  They had learned to live in harmony and balance with the earth and believed today’s Conference should be a starting point in the process of transformation and change based on indigenous knowledge. SAULI NIINISTÖ  President of Finland  speaking on behalf of the Western European and Other Group  said the conference marked an important step in fulfilling a key recommendation made in Alta a year ago.  Indigenous peoples should have the right to participate in the United Nations in matters that concerned them.  In that regard  the international community must express concern over reported attempts to prevent the representatives of indigenous people from the Russian Federation to join today’s conference.  Also vital was indigenous peoples’ participation in decision-making at the national level.  In Finland  authorities were obliged by law to negotiate with the Saami Parliament  the legislative body representing the indigenous Saami.  Recently  the Finnish Government had worked together with the Saami Parliament to expand the scope of the obligation to consult  with the proposed reform spelling out the concept of free  prior and informed consent. He said it was also critical that indigenous youth had the rights  means and support to participate in their societies.  To that end  access to education  information and means of communication were essential.  In his country  Saami youth had taken significant steps to increase their participation in cultural and political activities through the establishment of a youth council.  Measures to revive indigenous languages were an efficient way to strengthen the youth’s identity. HENRI DJOMBO  Minister of Forest Economy and Sustainable Development of the Congo  speaking on behalf of the Group of African States  stressed the importance of inclusive processes on matters affecting indigenous peoples.  “They are the participants and the subject ” he said  noting that they had participated actively in the preparatory processes leading up to today’s conference and made invaluable contributions to the Outcome Document.  The history of indigenous peoples in Africa varied from one country to another  and the marginalized among them required special protection.  African States had also participated in the preparatory processes and offered many ideas. He said that the Declaration  upon its adoption in 2007  had received strong support from African States  and marked a victory after more than two decades of battle for indigenous peoples.  More African States now recognized indigenous peoples as “first citizens”.  In February 2011  his Government had also enacted a law that set standards to promote and protect the rights of indigenous peoples.  The impact had been ground-breaking and tangible.  That had been followed by a new action plan in 2013  which aimed to improve the lives of indigenous peoples and ensure that they enjoyed the dividends of development.  The plan also ensured free  prior and informed consent on matters that affected them.  “The path to equality is a long one ” he said  expressing commitment to work with the United Nations to address issues affecting marginalized indigenous peoples. TOOMAS HENDRIK ILVES  President of Estonia  speaking on behalf of the Group of Eastern European States  said that Estonians had stood on both sides  as both an oppressed indigenous people and as members of the United Nations.  It was bizarre and shameful that some States had attempted to hinder indigenous peoples from participating in the Organization’s conferences.  The rights of indigenous peoples must be respected  he said  noting that the majority of States did so  but in many countries  material gains were prioritized over indigenous rights.  In other words  profit was pursued at the expense of culture. He spoke of the situation of indigenous peoples in his region  and thanked various nations for their concern  as they always sought to include indigenous peoples in their delegations.  He associated himself with the statement by the President of Finland regarding the inability of the Kola Saami to participate in the meeting.  The international community was obliged to do everything it could to support indigenous peoples  he said  adding  “Wherever they live  they must all be acknowledged.  We must learn to listen to the voices which have been silenced too long.” ENRIQUE PEÑA NIETO  President of Mexico  speaking on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean States  pledged a permanent commitment to support indigenous peoples worldwide  applauding the 2010 General Assembly resolution that mandated the convening of today’s meeting.  With a population of 45 million indigenous peoples  the Latin American and Caribbean region was linguistically diverse.  His Government had actively contributed to the preparatory process and negotiations on the Outcome Document for today’s conference  and the result was a product of open  inclusive and constructive dialogue that had included the participation of indigenous peoples.  Participants had made sure that the Outcome was in line with the Declaration  he said  describing the final document as “a road map to reposition indigenous peoples” in the United Nations agenda.  The post-2015 development agenda must also promote indigenous peoples’ rights. There were 5 000 distinct indigenous communities in the world  he said  urging each country to strengthen efforts to promote and protect their rights.  Mexico  with a population of 15 million indigenous peoples  recognized their right to self-determination and ensured non-discrimination against them.  A national policy was in place for the creation of better opportunities for them  ensuring access to education  health services  and justice.  Their products and handcrafts were also promoted  and his Government had established direct dialogue with indigenous communities to define public policy. OREN LYONS  JR.  Chief of the Onondaga Nation Council of Chiefs  greeted participants with a question about how to instruct 7 billion people on indigenous people’s relationship with the Earth.  The question was fundamental to humanity’s existence  and today’s generation would make the decision as to whether the species would survive.  Indigenous peoples were keepers of tradition.  One from Greenland had come with a message:  “The ice is melting”; thousands of feet had been lost at a pace that was accelerating. There must be reconciliation between all groups  he said  between nations and between corporations and nature.  Indigenous peoples believed in the order of the universe and the laws of creation  and that all life was bound by those tenets.  Indigenous peoples had suffered for generations  but were here today to include their voices in a plea for sanity.  There could be no peace as long as war was waged against the Earth  he said  urging that this crisis be addressed now  while there was still time.  “And as we speak  the ice continues to melt in the north.”  In conclusion  he told delegates that his speech today was the same one he had given 14 years ago  yet with the passage of time little had been done. AILI KESKITALO  President of the Saami Parliament of Norway  said that indigenous peoples had historically been marginalized  discriminated against and ignored  but they had not lost heart.  The Declaration’s adoption had been historic.  Despite that milestone  the gap remained to be closed between theory and practice.  The small city of Alta in the traditional Saami territory in Norway had hosted the Global Indigenous Preparatory Meeting  which had been the culmination of a process begun at the local level. She welcomed the Outcome Document that resulted from today’s World Conference and its recognition of the need to ensure indigenous peoples’ participation at United Nations meetings on issues that affected them.  Paraphrasing a Saami proverb  she said that all bad things eventually would come to an end.  Adoption of the Outcome text was a “small  yet important step” towards “the dawn of the day” for indigenous peoples.  The international community must persevere towards a realization of the common aspiration for human rights  justice  dignity  integrity and cultural identity. LUIS EVELIS  Member of the Senate of Colombia  representing the Latin American and the Caribbean region on behalf of the Global Indigenous Coordinating Group  acknowledged the Alta Outcome Document in the process leading up to today’s Outcome Document  particularly the fundamental principles and aspirations of indigenous peoples.  He was pleased to see many of its important provisions in the Outcome text.  Those tenets conformed to the Declaration and ensured the exercise of the fundamental collective rights of indigenous peoples  especially to land  territories and resources  which underpinned their well-being  and the right to freely determine their political status and pursue economic  social and cultural development. He stressed the need to work with Member States to establish mechanisms to ensure the implementation of the right and principle of free  prior and informed consent  particularly in the context of extractive industries and other major development projects affecting indigenous lands and territories.  He requested that Member States develop national processes to harmonize policies  laws and regulations with global instruments and commitments  in the framework of the Outcome Document  and with the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples. ZEID RA’AD AL-HUSSEIN  United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  said that in developed countries  the percentage of indigenous people in prison was highly disproportionate to their numbers.  In one country  indigenous children were 25 times more likely to be in detention than children elsewhere.  In Latin America and the Caribbean  indigenous children were three times more likely to not have access to education  safe drinking water or housing.  In Africa and Asia  indigenous young adults were more likely to be deprived of their right to education  especially if they were female.  In the Arctic  the Pacific and South-East Asia  indigenous women were at greater risk of death during pregnancy or childbirth than women from other communities  and their newborn and young children were also more likely to die.  Such stark statistics translated into thousands of human tragedies and thousands of human rights violations. He said that the World Conference and its Outcome Document were the stepping stones that would bring the work of the international community on indigenous peoples’ rights to a new level.  He called for a pledge from the world community to ensure that the human rights and dignity of all indigenous peoples were acknowledged and fully protected  in line with the Declaration.  The concerns and recommendations of indigenous peoples were essential to the Climate Summit and to the upcoming World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in 2015.  Natural disasters and the effects of climate change were often borne disproportionately by indigenous peoples  whose traditional knowledge could help mitigate the consequences. DALEE SAMBO DOROUGH  Chairperson of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues  said it was highly important to underscore not only the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter  but also the need for all parties to be mindful of the pertinent international legal obligations of Member States in relation to all peoples  including indigenous peoples.  She specifically emphasized the peremptory norms of international law and  in particular  the principle and right to self-determination  as affirmed by the Charter  and  among others  the international covenants and the Indigenous Peoples Declaration.  She said that consensus lost its validity if it was used to undermine the principles of justice  democracy  respect for human rights  equality  non-discrimination and good faith.  Good governance became a casualty if a few States or even one State was allowed to undermine such essential rights and principles at the global level.  In that regard  it was critical to recognize that indigenous peoples were among the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in the world.  Their human rights must not be politicized or otherwise undermined by local  regional and national State interests and agendas.  Rather  they must be respected and recognized.  The high-level meeting should be remembered for its contribution through a principled Outcome Document  and she called upon Member States to provide support for its effective implementation and mutually agreed upon terms of cooperation within the framework of the United Nations Declaration. RIGOBERTA MENCHÚ  indigenous leader and Nobel Laureate  said that 23 years ago  she had participated in the inaugural meeting of the working group on indigenous peoples.  Thanks to that group  progress had been made in discussions on the rights of indigenous peoples.  Since then  the United Nations had seen thousands of delegates come and go on the lead-up to the creation of the Permanent Forum.  Progress was being made in the area of indigenous peoples’ rights  she said  expressing her full support for the adoption of today’s Outcome Document.  The text would strengthen the action plans as well relationships among nations and nation-States. She said that many young people and children were suffering daily from the effects of violence in their communities  in attempts to protect their land and seas.  For indigenous people  peace was listening to various opinions  because “we are all part of one diversity.”  Over the course of the 34 years she had been linked to the United Nations  she said she had seen progress  but also frustration.  Indigenous people still lack basic services and rights  and if they were to achieve their freedom and self-determination  then all international standards must lead to dignified policies at the national level.  She paid tribute to other speakers and to all the young people participating in today’s meeting.     Action Following the opening statements  the Assembly adopted without a vote the draft resolution titled  “Outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples”. Speaking in explanation of position  the representative of the Permanent Observer Mission of Holy See expressed his delegation’s reservation on language regarding reproductive rights in operative paragraph 13. The representative of Canada said her delegation would table a short statement to explain its position and record some concerns. Round Table Discussion I Ghazali Ohorella  Representative of the Pacific Indigenous Region and Edita Hrda  Permanent Representative of the Czech Republic co-chaired the panel discussion  titled “United Nations system action for the implementation of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples”.  Panellists were Kanayo Nwanze  President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development; Victoria Tauli-Corpuz  Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; and Atencio Lopez  Representative of the Central and South America and the Caribbean Indigenous Region. Ms. HRDA commended efforts by Member States and representatives of indigenous peoples for having reached agreement on an outcome document.  The text represented a further step in the United Nations system in implementing its Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  he said. Mr. OHORELLA emphasized the important contribution to that text made by the preparatory meeting held in July 2013 in Alta  Norway.  The conference had found a realistic approach to be implemented at the national level.  Indigenous people had come a long way to see the Outcome text  which they had once thought impossible.  But there existed the gap between commitments and results. Dr. NWANZE said his agency  the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)  took indigenous peoples seriously.  They made up 5 per cent  or 370 million  of the world’s population.  They had struggled to preserve their identities  cultures and lands and had been neglected in the development process.  Their social and economic empowerment was vital to sustainable development and the creation of thriving communities.  Any global development agenda that ignored indigenous peoples was a “hollow exercise”. Policy did not mean anything unless it was matched with financial resources  he said  adding  “Let’s put money where the mouth is”.  His agency was providing $1.8 billion in loans to benefit indigenous peoples  and had set up the Indigenous Peoples Assistance Facility and created an indigenous peoples’ forum within the agency  which kept IFAD accountable  relevant and effective.  IFAD also had an internal fund to enable indigenous peoples to participate in this Conference.  Moreover  it supported the mainstreaming of indigenous peoples in sustainable development goals.  They had much to teach about ways to not jeopardize future generations. Ms. TAULI-CORPUZ said that indigenous concerns had become a cross-cutting issue in the United Nations system  acknowledging the role of the Permanent Forum.  Indigenous peoples’ interests were multifaceted  ranging from peace and security to human rights and the environment.  Indigenous peoples suffered equally from global problems  he said  urging the United Nations to take a more coherent approach to addressing the issues that affected them  including human rights violations so as to avoid marginalization in the development agenda.  Millennium Development Goals did not include indigenous peoples.  Unless United Nations actions were better coordinated  indigenous issues would always fall in the cracks. She was happy to see paragraphs in the Outcome Document that requested the Secretary-General to take specific actions  including the development of a system-wide action plan to ensure a coherent approach to achieving the goals of the Declaration.  Also welcome had been the call to appoint a senior official for coordinating the action plan and raising awareness of the rights of indigenous peoples.  The Secretary-General also had been asked to submit recommendations on how to use  modify and improve existing United Nations mechanisms to achieve the Declaration’s objectives  as well as ways to enhance a coherent  system-wide approach.  Regarding the monitoring implementation  she proposed that the United Nations hire more staff dedicated to implementing policy  and performance indicators should measure the number of those staff.  The senior official to be appointed should consult with indigenous peoples  she said  calling for an increase in dedicated resources to support the implementation of indigenous policy. Mr. LOPEZ commended the Outcome Document as something that indigenous peoples had dreamed about for a long time.  But he regretted that it had taken too long; many of his predecessors had already passed away without seeing the outcome.  After the Second World War  the Universal Declaration on Human Rights was adopted by the General Assembly  but the rights of indigenous peoples had not been respected.  They had to remain vocal about their problems because they were not the ones that implemented policies.  A great deal remained to be done.  Indigenous issues  now cross-cutting  required the engagement of many United Nations agencies. The Outcome Document  he said  reaffirmed the solemn commitment to respect  promote and advance indigenous peoples’ rights and uphold the principles of the Declaration.  But regrettably  the text had received a “frosty” reception in some parts of Latin America.  United Nations agencies should assume responsibility to implement the outcome by setting up funds to enable the participation of indigenous peoples in processes that affected them.  The United Nations should be a facilitator with full participation of indigenous representatives.  He recommended the inclusion of indigenous peoples in the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  Within the United Nations system  he liked to see an “Indigenous Ambassador”. When the floor opened for discussion  LUIS ALMAGRO  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay  said his country was homogenous but respected all ethnic minorities.  To that end  a census had been conducted to recognize minorities and reaffirm their rights. The representative of the Asia Caucus said that the Secretary-General should appoint an indigenous individual as a senior official on indigenous peoples  at a level not lower than that of Under-Secretary-General. The representative of the European Union Delegation hailed the Outcome Document as being inclusive and thus having broad ownership.  Coherent United Nations actions were vital and the Union  for its part  was reviewing its policies accordingly. ISABEL SAINT MALO DE ALVARADO  Vice-President and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Panama  said the country had five preservation areas for indigenous peoples  which encompassed 28 per cent of national territory.  Her Government had not ratified International Labour Organization Convention No. 169  but it recognized indigenous peoples in that context. The representative of National Indigenous Women’s Federation of Nepal urged each United Nations agency to develop or revise its indigenous peoples policy and develop implementation guidelines and performance indicators to make those fully compatible with the Declaration. The representative of the Inter-Agency Support Group on Indigenous Peoples Issues said that in addition to its work at the international level  country-specific dialogue between United Nations country teams  Governments and indigenous peoples was essential.  The United Nations Development Group Guidelines on Indigenous Peoples’ Issues was a tool to mainstream and integrate their issues in operational activities and programmes at the country level. Also delivering statements were speakers representing Pakistan  Spain  Hungary  France  United States  Viet Nam and Argentina. The representatives of the following United Nations entities and observers also spoke:  the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance  International Labour Organization (ILO)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)  Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity  United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC)  International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)  United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women). Also taking the floor were speakers representing the Arctic Caucus  Indigenous Persons with Disabilities Global Network  Cherokee Nation  Chief of the Chakma Circle  National Congress of Australia’s First Peoples  Mejlis of Crimean Tatar People  the Chickasaw Nation  Pacific Caucus  National Native Title Council  United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues  the Navajo Nation  Chippewas of the Thames First Nation in Canada (COTTFN)  International Indian Treaty Council  Citizen Potawatomi Nation  Pacific Disability Forum (Nepal Indigenous Disabled Association)  Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous People  National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center  Assyrian Universal Alliance  Americas Chapter  and Kalipunan ng Mga Katutubong Mamamayan ng Pilipinas. Round Table Discussion II David Choquehuanca  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bolivia and Joseph Ole Simmel  representative of the African Indigenous Region  co-chaired the panel on “Implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples at the national and local level”.  Panellists were James Anaya  former Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  and Soyata Maiga  Commissioner  African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights. Mr. ANAYA said the most formidable obstacle to fully implementing the indigenous peoples’ rights was ignorance — ignorance among the broader societies and political elites in the countries in which indigenous people lived.  That ignorance was manifested and perpetuated by mainstream media and popular stereotypes  which depicted indigenous peoples as relics of the past amid images of savagery or subjects of curiosity and romanticism.  As an example  he pointed to the pejorative use of the name “Redskins”  which is a United States-based professional football team.  Perhaps the greatest contributor to the widespread ignorance were mainstream educational systems  wherein the study of history regarded colonial and settler patterns as triumphant precursors to modern States  with little attention to the devastating consequences of those patterns for indigenous peoples in both the past and the present.  Instead  indigenous peoples had been cast into the roles of the savage or backward foe  of an obstacle to be overcome  or  alternatively  as the unwitting noble savage destined to succumb to modernity. While the Outcome Document adopted by consensus in the morning renewed Member States’ affirmation of the rights enshrined in the United Nations Declaration  he stressed that the commitment to implementing those rights must be accompanied by programmes in education and awareness-raising geared towards all of society.  Indigenous issues and realities must be mainstreamed into primary and secondary educational systems  he stressed.  Additionally  the media should be encouraged  and should itself adopt specific programmes  to become educated about indigenous peoples in relation to contemporary events.  Government authorities should be made aware of how their functions impacted and should impact on indigenous peoples.  Finally  indigenous peoples should be invited to contribute to such educational and awareness-raising efforts in the spirit of reconciliation  partnership and commitment to the human rights of all  as represented in the Declaration. Ms. MAIGA said that stereotypes of indigenous peoples’ behaviour had unfortunately contributed to discrimination against them.  Their resources were taken from them  they suffered from inadequate access to social services  among many other injustices.  The international community and the United Nations had alerted the world to that situation.  Regionally  the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights had been working tirelessly to undertake missions to enable Governments to interact with indigenous communities.  Their mandate was to receive complaints of human rights violations  and these efforts had begun to yield fruit. There were now policies and good practices in several countries  she said  adding that the Commission had cultural initiatives covering indigenous peoples throughout Africa.  Niger  for example  had recognized the rights of pastoral communities.  The Commission also referred to past injustices  she said  noting the importance of the Conference.  The assembled delegates  she said  were now the ones called upon to make the Outcome Document a living document  to show how the United Nations could be used to identify the requisite resources  to enable indigenous peoples to enjoy the fruits of their own labour. In the discussion that followed  the representative of the Indigenous Caucus of the Arctic highlighted a prophecy in her country  which said that a spider’s web would eventually cover the Earth.  “Think of the Internet today ” she explained.  Using the situation of her own group  she said that Inuit rights were being recognized in Canada  but that aboriginal treaty signatories were often left with no choice but to turn to the courts.  Indigenous peoples in Canada tried to get the Government to implement a modern treaty  which met their goals.  Self-determination  she said  was a process of incremental change. The representative of Denmark said his country had advanced indigenous rights and a long-term strategy for the Arctic.  He then ceded the speaker’s seat to the representative of Greenland  who listed important ways in which Greenland exercised its self-determination.  Her country  however  still had serious social problems  including erosion of traditional values  she added. The representative of the Caucus of Latin America and the Caribbean  noting that States still had reservations with respect to interpretation of laws and reforms  said legislation should apply uniformly to all inhabitants of a country and not favour one sector only.  Further  she proposed that legal systems of indigenous people be recognized by Member States. New Zealand’s representative said his country had developed its own unique approaches to support Maori to achieve their full potential.  Central to its approach and relationship with Maori was respect for indigenous peoples’ rights  underpinned by the principle of partnership.  The Waitangi Tribunal was a mechanism for inquiry into historical grievances  as well as contemporary issues relating to the Crown’s treaty relationship with iwi and Maori communities.  Significant progress had been made and completion of treaty settlements was more than halfway through  which typically included a Crown apology for historical wrongs and restitution of traditionally held lands and resources  thereby strengthening the partnerships between iwi and the Government. The representative of the Cordillera Peoples Alliance said that in his nation  collective rights to ancestral lands  territories and resources continued to be violated as State military forces were deployed in their communities to protect “destructive projects and corporate plunder”.  He called for a resumption of peace talks between the Philippine Government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines to “address the root causes of the armed conflict towards a just and lasting peace”. Guyana’s representative said that her country was firmly committed to the advancement of indigenous peoples.  Guyana was among the few countries to have enacted legislation to safeguard the rights of indigenous peoples  including land rights.  Indigenous leaders held leadership positions at national and local levels of Government in her country  she said  adding that those achievements could only have been accomplished through a strong partnership with indigenous peoples. Also participating in the discussion were representatives of Ecuador  South Africa  Nigeria  Ukraine  Venezuela  Brazil  Australia  Malaysia  Chile  Namibia  Suriname  Indonesia and the Inter-Parliamentary Union  as well as representatives of major civil society organizations Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-09-19,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/gaef3393.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Sixty-ninth General Assembly Second Committee 1st Meeting (PM) The Second Committee (Economic and Financial) of the United Nations General Assembly approved its organization of work for the sixty-ninth session this afternoon  also welcoming new bureau members and hearing proposals on working methods. Committee Chair Sebastiano Cardi (Italy) drew members’ attention to the Organization of Work (document A/C.2/69/L.1)  reminding delegates of General Assembly decisions on working methods and stressing that the packed agenda meant they would need to stick to deadlines in submissions of proposals and negotiations.  The Committee adopted the Organization of Work and a note by the secretariat on the status of documentation for the session (document A/C.2/69/L.1/Add.1) by consensus. Thanking the outgoing Committee bureau  Mr. Cardi welcomed its new members:  Vice-Chairpersons Tishka Francis ( Bahamas)  Tarik Izararen ( Morocco) and Alexsandra Stepowka ( Poland) and Rapporteur Borg Tsien Tham ( Singapore).  He then described how their responsibilities would be divided. He outlined his plans to ensure the Committee’s effective and efficient operation  which included a meeting on working methods  a commitment to start all meetings on time  and the production of concise  action-oriented resolutions.  Discipline and full use of time available for informal discussion of agenda items would aid in those efforts. For the first time in the Committee’s history  he said  the keynote speaker in its General Debate would be a woman  Janet Gornick  a Professor of Political Science and Sociology at the City University of New York Graduate Center.  The debate would run from 7 October until 9 October. Mr. Cardi told members that the Committee would hold special events to brainstorm and encourage unconventional thinking on topics.  Special events would focus on e-Government for sustainable development in small island d eveloping States; Investment promotion regime for foreign direct investment in least developed countries; Promoting accountability at all levels:  Monitoring the post-2015 development agenda; and Social market economy and new instruments of social finance.  Two joint meetings would be held with the Economic and Social Council. It was essential to conclude the Committee’s work by 26 November  not least because any draft proposals with financial implications had to be submitted to the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) by 1 December.  He noted that the second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries would be held in Vienna from 3 to 5 November and would affect availability of Committee members for consultations. The Second Committee will meet again on 7 October at 10 a.m. to begin its substantive work. * *** * Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-09-19,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11552.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Sixty-ninth General Assembly Plenary 3rd Meeting (PM)     Expressing grave concern over the recent deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa  the General Assembly this afternoon signalled its approval for United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s intention to set up an international emergency response mission and called upon all Member States to fully support it. Unanimously adopting a resolution on measures to contain and combat the virus (document A/69/L.2)  as orally revised  the Assembly asked the Secretary-General to take steps to promptly establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response  or UNMEER  and to submit a detailed report on that matter for the Assembly to consider at its current session. In identical letters dated 17 September to the Presidents of the Assembly and the Security Council (document A/69/389-S/2014/679)  the Secretary-General sets forth the Mission’s six guiding principles and 12 actions deemed critical by the Senior United Nations System Coordinator to carry out the Mission’s aims.  Those steps would cost almost $1 billion over the next six months. “We are all aware of the immensity of the suffering in West Africa and the enormity of the challenge ” Mr. Ban said  urging the global community to work in unorthodox ways and break institutional barriers and other hurdles to get the crisis under control.  “The establishment of the UNMEER is just the beginning.  We will need to stay engaged  and we will need to reach new heights of cooperation.  No single State  and no single organization  can do this alone.” The virus had already claimed more than 2 500 lives — most of them women  who formed the bulk of health-care workers and caregivers of the sick  he said.  Citing World Health Organization (WHO) figures  he said there were nearly 5 000 cases of Ebola infection in West Africa  but that given the shortfalls in reporting and monitoring  that number was likely much higher.  “None of us is insulated from the threat of Ebola:  all of us must be part of the response ” he said. What began as a public health emergency had become a crisis with significant economic  social  humanitarian  political and security consequences  he said  threatening to permanently undo recent development and security gains in the three most affected countries — Sierra Leone  Liberia and Guinea — after years of war and atrocity.  WHO had developed a response road map and was working with the affected nations to identify the best possible epidemiological response  including through a mix of Ebola treatment and community care centres  he said.  The new United Nations Mission  to be based in Accra  Ghana  would focus on stopping the outbreak  treating the infected  providing essential services  preserving stability  and preventing outbreaks in non-affected countries.  Echoing those concerns  Sam Kutesa (Uganda)  President of the General Assembly  who introduced the resolution  said the virus was spreading exponentially  with half of all cases having been recorded in just the last three weeks.  It was no longer a subregional or even regional calamity  but an international crisis.  According to WHO  at the current rate of infection  as many as 20 000 people could be infected in the next few months. “The time to act in a swift  coordinated and purposeful manner is now ” he said.  “Without quick and decisive action  the trail of devastation this outbreak leaves behind will reach far beyond the portions of West Africa most affected up to now.”  The outbreak  he warned  could have far-reaching  destabilizing impacts and came at a time when the three most-affected countries were embracing relative peace  security and stability. After the text’s adoption  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Liberia and representatives of Sierra Leone and Guinea took the floor to commend the Secretary-General’s swift action to install an emergency mission on the ground  thank Governments and organizations that had given military  financial  medical  personnel and logistical support  and call on Member States to lift travel bans to the affected countries.  In addition  several representatives cited their respective Government’s steps and financial pledges to help contain the virus. Also speaking today was the Minister for Health of South Africa. Other speakers included the representatives of Malawi (on behalf of the African States)  European Union  United States  Argentina  Kenya  India  Mozambique  Ecuador  Venezuela  United Kingdom  Mexico  Brazil  Japan  Canada  El Salvador  China  Cuba  Indonesia  Australia  Uganda  France  Sweden  United Republic of Tanzania and Ghana. Statements after Adoption AUGUSTINE KPEHE NGAFUAN  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Liberia  called on all Member States to take critical actions to implement the text.  The disease’s rapid spread had confounded Governments in the region and their partners at a time when those nations were experiencing peace after years of conflict.  Liberia’s health system was not prepared to take on an epidemic of such magnitude.  Nearly 80 per cent of those infected with the virus succumbed to it.  The fear created by the outbreak was undermining Liberia’s overall health care system and its ability to respond to other pressing medical concerns including malaria  diarrhoea  typhoid fever and pregnancy-related complications.  Many Government functions had been suspended to deal with the emergency.  The Government  World Health Organization (WHO)  Médecins San Frontières and the United States Centre for Disease Control had taken measures that were unsuccessful in controlling the virus’ transmission. Restricting travel to and from the most affected countries and banning flights would only aggravate the outbreak and undermine efforts to contain it  he said.  He praised nations that were now opening their borders to fight the disease and encouraged others to follow suit.  The United States announced a level of support to the region that would have monumental impact.  Yesterday’s Security Council meeting gave an impressive number of Member States the chance to indicate their support.  That ensured that the people in Liberia and the diaspora were not alone.  He commended the Secretary-General’s prudent  swift action.  A new mission would ensure strong United Nations leadership  effective coordination and swift delivery of supplies and services.  He commended all international partners for working to bring the disease to an early end. AARON MOTSOALEDI  Minister for Health of South Africa  said the virus had painfully highlighted how a public health issue could hinder a country’s economy and showed the urgent need to enforce measures to contain it.  The outbreak continued to escalate and expand geographically.  Laboratory capacity to address it was gradually expanding but there were critical needs in several locations.  In response  South Africa had provided a mobile laboratory in Sierra Leone; it would provide further support for Liberia  and planned to set up a 40-bed field hospital there  staffed by 75 health professionals.  Recruitment of those professionals was under way.  It would also provide four ambulances  four generators and 70 vehicles. South Africa had called on many partners in the private sector to provide aid  he said.  His Government received pledges of support  from companies listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange  in the form of logistics  air travel  ambulances and medical supplies.  On 26 September  the Southern African Development Community (SADC) would begin training 16 countries to help strengthen surveillance.  South African hospitals would also enhance clinical management of infected patients; 11 hospitals in the country were on standby in case of an Ebola outbreak.   CHARLES P. MSOSA (Malawi)  speaking on behalf of the African States  welcomed the resolution adopted in the Assembly.  The outbreak was unprecedented and people  including traders and farmers  lived in fear now.  The crisis was giving a hard time to post-conflict countries.  The African Union had commenced initiatives to tackle the problem  including a decision taken on 19 August by its Peace and Security Council.  It was important to listen to voices on the ground  and vital to harmonize all strategic efforts in Africa. NAFSIKA NANCY EVA VRAILA of the European Union Delegation said the outbreak of Ebola was no longer a regional problem.  The bloc welcomed the Secretary-General’s plan to establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response.  All relevant parts of the United Nations system should be activated to support that organ.  The Union would continue assisting the most affected areas through the United Nations  regional organizations and non-governmental organizations.  It had pledged 150 million euros.  In addition  it had contributed 5 million euros to the African Union. VANDI CHIDI MINAH (Sierra Leone) paid tribute to the medical staff that had given their lives to the virus and said the Ebola outbreak was now a global health emergency.  With the help of the global community  he was confident the necessary supplies would make their way to the region and expressed confidence that the United Nations mission would be set up as soon as possible and that the affected countries would regain their development momentum.  The World Bank had already recorded a drop in their development level.  As the epidemic had a disproportionate impact on women  the response must be gender-sensitive.  The road ahead would be difficult.  Everyone had a role to play.  “A culture of fear should not be allowed to let this epidemic metastasize into something greater ” he said.  Various supplies were en route to Sierra Leone and various non-governmental organizations had advocated support for efforts to address the virus. MAMADI TOURÉ (Guinea) said the unprecedented crisis  in full swing in his country and neighbouring Liberia and Sierra  required urgent steps to save lives.  The epidemic had already claimed more than 2 400 lives  including caregivers in Guinea  where the outbreak began in March.  It had gravely impacted the region’s economies  slowing trade  economic activity  investment and tourism.  The World Bank had warned that if the outbreak did not subside  its economic impact would be catastrophic.  Already it had significantly increased prices for basic food items.  It was imperative to end the crisis  and international intervention was vital and must be well coordinated.  Guinea’s people and Government were committed to cooperating closely with the United Nations mission to ensure its success.  He thanked WHO  Médecins Sans Frontières  the United States Center for Disease Control  and nations such as Morocco and Malawi for their support  solidarity and friendship. ELIZABETH COUSENS of the United States strongly supported the Secretary-General’s plan to establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response.  On 18 September  about 130 countries had come together to co-sponsor a Security Council resolution to scale up the global response to the Ebola outbreak.  Today  the Assembly had come together to support the Secretary-General’s plan.  Her Government would use its specialized capabilities in support of those efforts and urged other Governments and stakeholders to join.  It was not the commitment made that was important  but rather the commitment delivered. MARÍA CRISTINA PERCEVAL (Argentina) said she attended today’s meeting because the Assembly was the most representative body  welcoming the consensus adoption of the resolution in support of establishing the crisis-response mission.  The Secretary-General had said the outbreak was not a health problem  but rather a multidimensional threat with humanitarian  social and economic impact.  The affected countries did not deserve that as they charted a path to development.  The crisis also revealed ongoing concerns about poverty and inequality. MACHARIA KAMAU (Kenya) said the Ebola crisis posed among the worst threats in the world today.  No one was safe from its reach.  The lessons of the HIV/AIDS epidemic must not be forgotten.  The crisis must be recognized and defined as a threat to international peace and security  and as a global humanitarian catastrophe.  The response must commensurate to the challenge  technically thorough and in solidarity with affected countries to free them from isolation.  Kenya had put in place a national preparedness programme at home  and donated $1 million total to the three affected countries.  It would share its expertise on Ebola management  diagnostic capabilities and health-care workers with those nations.  The Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs had announced the Government was working to review the ban on flights to affected countries.   ASOKE KUMAR MUKERJI (India) expressed grave concern over the virus.  His Government had provided medicines and financial aid to its counterparts in Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone  and had contributed funds to WHO to address the virus.  India had troops available in the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL).  As 45 000 Indian nations lived in West Africa  India stood in solidarity with the people in that region. ANTÓNIO GUMENDE (Mozambique) commended those countries that had already pledged provision of resources to assist the most affected countries  as well as their neighbours  including the announced deployment of personnel under the African Union Support to Ebola Outbreak mission. XAVIER LASSO MENDOZA (Ecuador) expressed solidarity with West African countries  especially Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea.  His Government consulted with officials from those countries to identify their people’s needs.  He underscored the general support extended by Cuba despite the illegal blockade it faced. SAMUEL MONCADA (Venezuela)  expressing concern over the epidemic  said that action was needed to contain it  with a gender-specific focus as most of the victims were women.  In Quito  from 8 to 9 September  the first meeting of the Special Committee of the South American-African Cooperation Forum expressed grave concern over the epidemic’s consequences  and decided that the Union of South American Nations should hold a meeting as soon as possible to find ways to support the region.  His Government was looking at ways to urgently do that. MARTIN SHEARMAN (United Kingdom)  associating himself with the European Union Delegation  said the international community must work to combat the virus and prevent its spread.  He welcomed adoption of the Council resolution and the Secretary-General’s intention to create a special mission towards that end.  His Government would provide a $60 million health-care centre in the affected region  military experts and staff from Save the Children United Kingdom.  On 17 September  it had announced a significant increase in its package of support  with a total of 700 treatment beds for Sierra Leone.  It would deliver another 500 treatment beds and staff to operate them.  It was partnering with WHO  Médecins Sans Frontières  UNICEF and other aid actors. The representative of Mexico said his delegation felt that the convening of today’s meeting was timely as it followed yesterday’s adoption of the Security Council resolution to scale up global response to the Ebola outbreak.  The response must be borderless.  Today’s adoption of the Assembly resolution that backed the establishment of the crisis-response mission was a clear testimony of international cooperation.  ANTONIO DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil) said the Peacebuilding Commission would serve as a common platform in New York for discussion  information-sharing and awareness-raising.  His Government would have liked recognition of the Commission’s early warning function in today’s resolution. The representative of Japan supported the Assembly resolution and expected the United Nations to combat the virus as one unified body.  So far  his Government had committed $5 million for West Africa  and had dispatched Japanese doctors and medical suits for health-care workers to the region.  It stood ready to provide a new medication against Ebola developed by two Japanese pharmaceutical companies.  In the long-term  it would continue to support affected countries’ national efforts to combat the disease. MICHAEL DOUGLAS GRANT (Canada) expressed deep concern over the crisis.  Canada made early contributions to the emergency response  deploying experts  vaccines and material and financial support to the region.  It had contributed to WHO  Médecins Sans Frontières and local offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)  and deployed a mobile laboratory to Sierra Leone with rotating teams of laboratory technicians  as well as four delegates of the Canadian Red Cross and four of Canada’s UNICEF office.  It had provided more than $2.5 million in medical equipment to WHO and nearly 1 000 doses of an experimental vaccine in addition to actively contributing to expert panels on Ebola. RUBÉN IGNACIO ZAMORA RIVAS El Salvador said that the Ebola outbreak required prompt efficient and joint efforts.  It supported the Secretary-General’s proposal to establish the crisis-response Mission  which would work hand in hand with WHO and other programmes and agencies of the United Nations.  In his country  more than 80 doctors and medical personnel had signed up for rendering services in West Africa. WANG HAO China said that “time means life”.  With the passage of time  it would become harder to put the disease under control.  China experienced the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome disease in 2003 and understood the suffering of the people of West Africa.  His country had 174 medical experts in the most affected countries.  Yesterday  it decided to provide 200 million yuan in additional aid for West African nations and to give $2 million each to WHO and the African Union. RODOLFO REYES RODRÍGUEZ (Cuba) expressed solidarity with the affected countries and support for the Secretary-General’s proposed emergency response mission.  “We can pull this off.  The people — the women  the children of West Africa — deserve this response ” he said.  Every member of Cuba’s specialized medical response team had more than 15 years experience addressing medical epidemics.  Cuba would work with all countries  including those with which it did not have diplomatic relations  to help combat the disease.  Cuba’s more than 4 000 health workers stood ready. MASNI ERIZA (Indonesia) said a coordinated international response to combat Ebola’s spread was vital.  He fully supported the Secretary-General’s initiative and expressed hope that the crisis could be contained soon. PHILIPPA JANE KING (Australia) said action was urgent as there was much catching up to do to reverse the epidemic’s spread.  A coordinated  comprehensive response was vital.  She strongly supported the Secretary-General’s proposed mission  and stood in solidarity with the affected countries.  Australia’s Foreign Minister recently announced that his Government would give another $7 million  including for the WHO coordinated regional response.  Australia would continue to assess areas where it could best contribute. RICHARD NDUHUURA (Uganda) said that as soon as the first cases of Ebola were identified  public health officials in his country had created makeshift quarantines and called a press conference together with WHO.  It exposed the problem right away and de-mystified any stigma attached to it.  Uganda sent 20 top Ebola experts to Sierra Leone and Liberia in July. FRANCOIS XAVIER DENIAU (France) said the health crisis  due to its scale  had turned into a social and economic problem  becoming a threat to peace and security.  He underscored the importance of “act  coordinate and prevent”.  France had made financial contributions and on 18 September its President announced the establishment of a military hospital in Guinea.  He also described how the European Union was coordinating efforts while stressing the importance of preventive measures.   CARL ORRENIUS SKAU (Sweden) welcomed the Secretary-General’s initiative to soon convene a high-level meeting on the matter and today’s Assembly decision to set up an emergency response mission.  Sweden had long-standing international relations with the affected countries and had contributed $4.4 million to the response to combat the virus.  It was in the final stages of devising an additional aid package of $13 million.  As Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission’s country configuration for Liberia  Sweden would continue contributing to that country’s long-term peacebuilding priorities and those of the region.   The representative of the United Republic of Tanzania regretted travel and flight bans to the affected countries.  It was vital to foster the socioeconomic development of the affected countries and the region as a whole to enable it to better prevent and address the health-care crisis.  He supported the Secretary-General’s initiative. GEORGE WILFRED TALBOT (Guyana) supported the Secretary-General’s initiative and a massive scaling up of emergency aid to help control the crisis.  Guyana was giving active consideration to an appropriate contribution in the context of the global response.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-09-16,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11549.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Sixty-ninth General Assembly Plenary 1st Meeting (PM)     Calling for Action  Secretary-General Anticipates ‘Most Consequential’ Session in Generation as He Urges Attention to Rising Tide of Intolerance Despite an unprecedented array of such weighty challenges as poverty  armed conflicts and climate change  the international community could achieve great things with dedication and single-mindedness of purpose and compromise  said the new President of the General Assembly this afternoon as he opened its sixty-ninth session. “The coming year will be a momentous time for the United Nations ” said Sam Kutesa (Uganda)  as it would mark the seventieth anniversary of its founding and 15 years since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration  among other milestones.  The current session would be “very busy”  with Member States preoccupied with intergovernmental negotiations on a post-2015 development agenda.  In addition  preparations and negotiations were under way towards an outcome for the third Conference on Financing for Development in July 2015 in Addis Ababa  and an agreement on climate change under the United Nations Framework Convention.  Noting the theme of the general debate  “Delivering on and Implementing a Transformative Post-2015 Development Agenda”  he stressed the need to ensure that the new development agenda was truly transformative  with the eradication of poverty and hunger and the promotion of sustained and inclusive economic growth as its overarching objectives.  To that end  he would convene three high-level thematic debates and one high-level event  although those debates would not preempt or prejudge the outcome of the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations. The first such debate  slated for February 2015  would be on the means of implementation for the post-2015 development agenda.  The second one  to be held in March  would focus on advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women in the post-2015 development agenda.  The third would be held in April or May and address the peaceful settlement of disputes and strengthening cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations. A high-level event on combating climate change would be held in June to give momentum and added impetus to efforts to reaching a global agreement  he said.  His presidency would also seek to revitalize the General Assembly and reform the Security Council. “To say we are living in tumultuous times would seem an understatement ” he said  citing such daunting challenges as poverty and hunger; persistent unemployment; violent armed conflicts; faltering education systems; climate change and rising sea-levels; inadequate infrastructure; dire health threats like Ebola; and a rise in polarization  extremism and terrorist activities.  Those formidable challenges must be tackled with a sense of resolve and resilience over the next 12 months  he urged. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the Assembly would focus on stemming the existential threat of climate change  advancing the rights and opportunities of the world’s indigenous people  improving the health of women and girls  tackling the deadly Ebola virus  and addressing today’s many peace and security challenges.  He urged the international community to work together to accelerate progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals  establish a set of sustainable development goals and an agenda to erase extreme poverty in the next 15 years  as well as to create a greener  cleaner planet  make human rights a top priority  and promote peace and security worldwide for everyone. “The coming year must be a time for action.  A time for results ” he said  stressing that the session could be the “most consequential” in and for a generation.  The Assembly’s eyes also must be open to the rising tide of intolerance and serve as the ultimate rebuke to that distorted  venomous view of the world.  In an interconnected world  the best way to solve problems was by working together in a more determined way than ever before.  “By being here  you have shown your commitment to that twenty-first century truth and command.  Now let us prove it through principled and effective action ” he said. In other business today  the Assembly took note of a letter from the Secretary-General (document A/69/374) informing the Assembly President that five Member States were behind in payments of financial contributions to the Organization under the Charter’s Article 19  which says that a Member State in arrears will have no vote in the Assembly if the amount of those arrears exceeds the amount of the contributions due from the preceding two years. The Assembly also decided that its Credentials Committee for the sixty-ninth session would comprise Brazil  China  Bangladesh  Denmark  Jamaica  Namibia  Senegal  Russian Federation and the United States.    Assembly members then authorized 11 of its subsidiary organs to meet at Headquarters during the session  as follows:  the Preparatory Committee for the Third United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Development (Habitat III); Intergovernmental Preparatory Committee for the 10-year Review Conference on the Implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action; Panel of External Auditors of the United Nations  the Specialized Agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); Board of Auditors; Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; Disarmament Commission; Independent Audit Advisory Committee; Executive Board of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women); Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People; Working Group on the Financing of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA); and the Committee on Relations with the Host Country.   The General Assembly will meet again at a date and time to be announced.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.

2014-09-15,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11546.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Sixty-eighth General Assembly Plenary 109th Meeting (PM)   Resolution Adopted on Clean Technologies  Decisions Taken on Draft Agenda for Next Session The General Assembly’s sixty-eighth session came to a close today  with the outgoing President noting that there had been some great successes in the past session  despite the challenging circumstances. John Ashe  President of the sixty-eighth session  said today was a far cry from the day in June 2013  when he had assumed the podium in the temporary General Assembly Hall.  “I am here to tell you that there was nothing temporary or makeshift about the memorable outcomes that we have as a collective whole achieved this session ” he said.  During his term  he said  the General Assembly had adopted more than 300 resolutions and 80 decisions on a wide range of issues  including nuclear disarmament  rule of law at national and international levels  financing for development  the peaceful use of outer space  the right to privacy  the safety of journalists and peacekeeping budgets.  Moving forward  delegates would have to pay particular attention to the most vulnerable in society  especially women and children.  Women could no longer be relegated to the status of second-class citizens  while youth should be brought into the planning stages as an integral part of the Assembly’s work. There was a long list of other accomplishments  he said  noting  among others  the fourth Biennial Review of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  the High-level Declaration on migration and development  a renewed commitment to the fight against non-communicable diseases  a resolution on enhancing the functioning of the human rights treaty body system  the establishment of the Nelson Mandela Prize and the unveiling of the winning design for a memorial in remembrance of the victims of slavery and transatlantic slave trade. One of his objectives had been to make progress on revitalizing and reforming the General Assembly  he said  voicing satisfaction at the progress made towards making the Organization more relevant  more responsive and more effective.  Much work remained to be done  however  particularly in the area of Security Council reform  he said  adding that the international community must not “shy away” from that endeavour.  He hoped the membership would build on the modest momentum that had been achieved in that area during the session. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon paid tribute to the outgoing President  recalling that it had been an eventful year with a full agenda  including on the Millennium Development Goals  the post-2015 development agenda and the need for a meaningful new climate change agreement.  Throughout the session  he said  the world had faced many global challenges that left the Security Council paralysed  and on which  the General Assembly had risen to act.  Speaking directly to the President  he said  “through it all  you demonstrated wise leadership in steering our global discussion toward constructive solutions”. Mr. Ban noted that Mr. Ashe had come from a small island with a “big capacity to work with other countries” and that he had used his training as an engineer to build consensus.  Mr. Ashe’s leadership as Co-chair of the Rio+20 Conference had paved a foundation for future deliberations on sustainable development goals.  The Assembly session had truly set the stage for a successful post-2015 development agenda through a number of important thematic debates and valuable high-level events.  He applauded Mr. Ashe’s efforts  saying they would have a positive effect on the world’s collective long-term future  including his initiatives to revitalize the Assembly. Action Acting without a vote  the Assembly adopted the draft resolution  titled “Four one-day structured dialogues on possible arrangements for a facilitation mechanism to promote the development  transfer and dissemination of clean and environmentally sound technologies” (document A/68/L.62). Speaking after the adoption  the representative of the European Union Delegation believed that the further elaboration of the areas covered in the structured dialogues must be at the core of future technology discussions.  His delegation remained open to considering new ideas and proposals  but felt that additional time should not be devoted to discussing areas where no consensus was emerging. The representative of Japan said her country remained keen to share its knowledge and technology with the international community.  Without technology  it would be impossible to achieve any development in any country.  The primary outcome from the structured dialogues was the realization of the importance to create an environment that was conducive to engaging the private sector  which were the primary owner and developer of technology. The representative of India said that  with the resolution’s passage  the Assembly had provided a mandate for continued discussions  while also linking them with the post-2015 development agenda.  The resolution mandated the continuation of discussions based on recommendations of the General Assembly President  taking into account the outcomes of the four structured dialogues. The representative of Indonesia was pleased with the outcome document from the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development  which recognized the important role of technology for development.  Developing countries  in particular  faced major challenges  and the structured dialogues had provided a comprehensive picture of the importance of technology in development  he said  calling for more discussions on the topic. The representative of the United States said the resolution reconfirmed the importance of technology to development solutions and generated ideas for next steps.  However  there was still significant work to be done and it was critical to understand the issue more broadly.  There must be a more substantial  analytical exercise and a better understanding of the private sector’s position. The representative of Australia said her delegation believed intellectual property rules were not a barrier or constraint to technology development or transfer  but rather helped to encourage investment and innovation. Moving on to a series of outstanding matters  the Assembly took note of “The Report of the Security Council” (document A/68/2) and decided to include a number of items in the draft agenda of the coming session. Among them were Question of the Comorian island of Mayotte  Question of Cyprus; Armed aggression against the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas); the situation of democracy and human rights in Haiti; Armed Israeli aggression against the Iraqi nuclear installations and its grave consequences for the established international system concerning the peaceful uses of nuclear energy  the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and international peace and security; and Consequences of the Iraqi occupation of and aggression against Kuwait. It also decided that the next session should consider  among others  the Addendum to the report of the Secretary-General on Strengthening and Coordinating United Nations rule of law activities (document A/68/213/Addendum 1)  as well as the draft agenda an item titled “the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991”. The following items  the Assembly decided  would not be included in the draft agenda:  Strengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes  conflict prevention and resolution; Strengthening of international cooperation and coordination of efforts to study  mitigate and minimize the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster; Programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013; and Proposed programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015. The body deferred to the next session consideration of the following items:  International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994; the situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan; Financing of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad; Financing of the United Nations Mission in East Timor; Investigation into the conditions and circumstances resulting in the tragic death of Dag Hammarskjöld and of the members of the party accompanying him; and Human Rights Council Resolution 24/24. Mr. Ashe forwarded to the incoming Assembly President for consideration and action at the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples the draft resolution  entitled “Outcome document of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples”.  He also forwarded the current version of the draft resolution on “the Organization of the United Nations Summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda”. On a point of order  the representatives of the United States and the European Union said it was understood that the agenda item regarding “Human Rights Council Resolution 24/24” had been closed.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

Sixty-eighth General Assembly Plenary 108th Meeting (PM) Delegates A lso Pass Measures Addressing Malaria  Revitalizing Work of Assembly The General Assembly adopted three resolutions today  including one that would pave the way for the incorporation of sustainable development goals into the post-2015 development agenda. In adopting the “Report of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 66/288” (document A/68/L.61)  as orally amended  the Assembly decided that the outcome document from the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals would be the main basis for integrating the sustainable development goals into the future development agenda.  The resolution went on to state that other inputs would also be considered during the intergovernmental negotiation process at the upcoming General Assembly session. Speaking in explanation of position  the representative of Bolivia  speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  said the Group attached a high degree of importance to the outcome document of the Open Working Group  which contained constructive guidance for the sustainable development goals.  He noted that all reservations on the text must be compiled into and clearly referenced in an official document. Libya’s representative  speaking on behalf of the Arab Group  said the Group had “valid and well-founded” concerns about Goal 16 of the proposed sustainable development goals.  The Group requested that the goal include targets on ending all forms of colonial domination and foreign occupation; strengthening adherence to international law by all stakeholders; and intensifying international cooperation on countering terrorism  especially by addressing its root causes.  He reiterated his request that the Arab Group’s positions be reflected in the Working Group’s report. The representative of Malawi  speaking on behalf of the African Group and associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that today’s adoption signified the beginning of an important journey that would take the international community through the next phase of development negotiations. The representative of the European Union Delegation noted that considerable progress had been made over the last 18 months and said the discussions that had taken place within the Open Working Group would inform the intergovernmental negotiation process during the upcoming General Assembly session. Benin’s representative  speaking on behalf of the Group of Least Developed Countries  said a multilateral approach was the only way to tackle the world’s problems.  He stressed the need to take into account the relevant reservations that had been expressed  without challenging the substance of the document. In another act  the Assembly adopted the “Report of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the Work of the General Assembly” (document A/68/951*) and the resolution contained there within.  Through the resolution’s adoption  Assembly members decided to establish an ad hoc working group on the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly to identify ways to enhance the role  authority  effectiveness and efficiency of the Assembly by building on progress already achieved. Speaking after the adoption  the European Union Delegation’s representative pointed to “concrete results” within the resolution adopted  including the earlier election of non-permanent Security Council and Economic and Social Council members.  He added that the agendas of the General Assembly and Economic and Social Council needed to be rationalized to eliminate duplication and overlap  as well as boost complementarity when considering and negotiating similar and related issues. The representative of Liechtenstein welcomed a resolution reconfirming the President of the General Assembly’s role in supporting the election process for the Secretary-General by identifying potential candidates in consultation with Member States.  That had not yet happened  but hopefully  future Presidents would fulfil the mandate.  He said he hoped to start a debate in the General Assembly on criteria for possible candidates and regretted that the adopted text did not that. The representative of Algeria  speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  said the process of revitalizing the work of the General Assembly did not stop with the passage of the resolution  but rather  was an ongoing effort. In a final act  the Assembly adopted ”Consolidating gains and accelerating efforts to control and eliminate malaria in developing countries  particularly in Africa  by 2015” (document A/68/L.60)  thereby calling for increased support for the implementation of international commitments and goals pertaining to the fight to eliminate malaria. The resolution urged malaria-endemic countries to work towards financial sustainability to increase national resources allocated to controlling that disease  while also working with the private sector to improve access to quality medical services.  Further  the resolution called upon Member States to establish or strengthen national policies  operational plans and research  with a view to achieving internationally agreed malaria targets for 2015. Ethiopia’s representative  speaking on behalf of the African Group  called the resolution “critical” as it would serve as a rallying call for countries and provided tangible guideposts for development partners. Also speaking today were representatives of Belarus  Thailand  Slovakia  Guatemala  Iran  United States  Japan  India  Brazil  Nigeria  Palau  Ecuador and Australia. The General Assembly will reconvene on Thursday  11 September  for a high-level stock-taking event on the Post-2015 Development Agenda.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-09-09,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11542.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Sixty-eighth General Assembly Plenary 107th Meeting (PM)   Texts on International Decade for People of African Descent  International Criminal Court  United Nations Administration Also Passed The General Assembly adopted four resolutions today  including one on sovereign debt restructuring that would establish an intergovernmental negotiation process aimed at increasing the efficiency  stability and predictability of the international financial system. With 124 votes in favour  11 votes against and 41 abstentions  the Assembly adopted “Towards the establishment of a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes” (document A/68/L.57/Rev.1). Introducing the draft resolution  Sacha Sergio Llorentty Solíz (Bolivia)  speaking for the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  said the text stressed the importance of timely  effective  understandable and lasting debt restructuring solutions for developing countries that would promote growth in an inclusive manner. However  Terri Robl ( United States)  speaking in explanation of vote  stressed that she could not support a statutory mechanism for sovereign debt restructuring as such a mechanism was likely to create economic uncertainty.  That uncertainty could impact upon the provision of financing to developing countries.  In the past  market-oriented approaches had been preferred and work was ongoing in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and elsewhere.  Furthermore  not only had the resolution presupposed a final outcome  which inhibited proper discussion  it had been snuck onto the docket at the very end of the session  establishing a costly mandate and asking Member States “to write a blank cheque”. Hector Timerman  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Argentina  expressing pride that so many countries supported the resolution  stated that as a “democratic forum par excellence”  the General Assembly was the right place for discussions aiming at embarking on an ethical political and legal pathway to end unbridled speculation.  The clear majority agreed it was time to establish a legal framework for restructuring that respected creditors while allowing debtors to emerge from debt safely.  The profits currently made by vulture funds were scandalous and were funnelled into campaigning and lobbying to prevent changes to the situation. Addressing those who had not voted in favour of the resolution  he noted that those delegates generally represented centres of finance.  Yet  a legal restructuring framework would benefit developed  as well as developing  countries.  Sovereign debt held development back and the establishment of a better system could improve global economic security.  The Assembly’s democratic decision to support the creation of a mechanism would give the peoples of the world what they deserved  saving them from the “sinister masters of opulence” who ran vulture funds. Rodolfo Reyes Rodríguez ( Cuba) pointed out that vulture funds did not deserve the name “vulture”.  Vultures contributed positively to ecosystems; vulture funds were parasitic.  Developing countries had paid many times the amounts originally received as loans and that ate resources essential to development.  He wondered how much progress on the Millennium Development Goals had been missed through such denial of resources. Shorna-Kay Marie Richards (Jamaica)  noting how recent events brought urgency to addressing sovereign debt and establishing a multilateral mechanism for restructuring  said that the United Nations dealt with States’ sustainable development objectives.  Therefore  the General Assembly was an appropriate forum in which to consider those issues.  The private market could not fully address problems of unsustainable sovereign debt.  That had been particularly apparent in speculation by specialized investment funds that purchased distressed and deeply discounted sovereign debt on secondary markets for the sole purpose of recouping full value through litigation. The Assembly then took up the draft resolution  “Programme of activities for the implementation of the International Decade for People of African Descent (document A/68/L.58)  which it adopted without a vote. Karel Jan Gustaaf van Oosterom (Netherlands)  introducing the draft resolution “Report of the International Criminal Court” (document A/68/L.59)  said that the document provided political support for the International Criminal Court and the work it carried out  while underlining the important relationship between the Court and the United Nations.  The text also served to remind the world of the need to cooperate with the Court to ensure its effective functioning. Speaking before the action  Almustafa Mubarak Hussein Rahamtalla ( Sudan) said the International Criminal Court targeted African States.  His country was not party to the Rome Statute and  therefore  was not bound by its decisions  particularly given that Sudan’s national justice system was ready and able to deal with any legal issues. Christian Wenaweser ( Liechtenstein) voiced regret that the text demonstrated a lack of progress since the previous year and looked forward to a higher quality  more relevant document in the future.  He underscored that the text was the only one dealing with the relationship between the United Nations and the International Criminal Court.  States parties to the Rome Statute had offered ideas for improving the draft  but few were included.  He called on the Security Council to use its power to refer States not party to the Rome Statute to the Court and said the recent Council visit to the Court should be followed up by practical measures. Thembile Elphus Joyini ( South Africa) said  as a State party to the Rome Statute  his country was well aware of the tremendous costs of investigations and persecutions of cases referred to the Court by the Security Council.  Such costs should be borne by the United Nations.  He went on to express disappointment that the resolution did not include a paragraph on financing. Koki Muli Grignon ( Kenya) said her country believed that the current implementation and interpretation of the Rome Statute was counterproductive and antagonistic.  The Rome Statute was undergoing a test of veracity  usefulness and impartiality and she urged the international community to take prompt and decisive action to ensure that the “ Kenya cases” do not drag on ad infinitum. The Assembly then took up the draft resolution titled “Enhancement of the administration and financial functioning of the United Nations (document A/68/L.42/Rev.1)  adopting it without a vote.

2014-09-08,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11540.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Sixty-eighth General Assembly Plenary 106th Meeting (PM)     President Says ‘Fresh Approach’ Needed In a decision that mirrored similar proceedings from last year  the General Assembly decided today that intergovernmental negotiations on the issue of Security Council reform would carry forward to the next Assembly session. Taking up the “Question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and related matters”  Member States decided the issue would be moved forward to the Assembly’s sixty-ninth session.  An open-ended working group on the matter would also be convened. John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda)  President of the General Assembly  said a “fresh approach” was needed  recalling that upon his election he had hoped to advance the reform agenda.  With that in mind  he had undertaken negotiations with Member States with no illusions concerning the magnitude and complexity of the task.  It would be “foolhardy” to underestimate the challenges that existed; however  Security Council reform was an issue that Member States must not “shy away from”. In regards to one of the outcomes from the intergovernmental negotiations  the so-called “non-paper” which contained a set of ideas pertaining to the reform negotiations  Mr. Ashe noted that although views on the text were clearly mixed  he was thankful for the positive support it had received from Member States and would communicate its findings to his successor for the sixty-ninth session. The representative of Brazil said that although the roll-over decision was a mere repetition of events last year  the President’s term would be remembered as a time when the issue of Security Council reform had been advanced  particularly when considering the contributions of the non-paper.  However  he warned  without meaningful reform  there was risk of the Organization being discredited. Pakistan’s representative said the Assembly had taken a prudent and wise decision.  The reform process must be pursued in good faith in an open  inclusive and transparent manner that would result in a solution garnering the widest possible political consensus from Member States.  Divisiveness would not be helpful for future efforts  he cautioned. The representative of China agreed  saying that postponing a decision on potential reforms was a practical move and that efforts must be made to develop a package solution that took into account the interests and concerns of all parties. However  India’s representative said the draft decision was no different from that adopted a year ago  despite the efforts of Member States.  In fact  no real progress had been made over the last year  including the contents of the non-paper  which  he noted  had been conspicuously left out of the text of the decision. Also speaking were representatives of Japan  Italy  Germany  Colombia  Russian Federation  Solomon Islands and Algeria. The General Assembly will meet again at 3 p.m. on Tuesday  9 September  to consider four draft resolutions.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-09-04,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/dev3112.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States 7th & 8th Plenary Meetings (AM & PM) ‘ Samoa Pathway’ Document Calls for Building Resilience  Increased Partnerships Renewing commitment to the sustainable development of small island developing States (SIDS)  world leaders today agreed on a landmark action plan at the conclusion of the United Nations Third International Conference on those nations held in Apia  Samoa. Unanimously adopting the wide-ranging outcome document  titled “Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action” — Samoa Pathway — the Heads of State and Government and other high-level representatives also reaffirmed that small island developing States remained “a special case” for sustainable development due to their unique and particular vulnerabilities (document A/CONF.223/3). The text set out new modalities of action on a range of issues  including sustainable  inclusive and equitable economic growth  climate change  sustainable energy  disaster risk reduction  sustainable use of marine resources  and means of implementing those objectives. While stressing that the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was the primary international intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change  world leaders acknowledged the important role of small island developing States in advocating for ambitious global efforts to address climate change and raising awareness of the need for bold and urgent action at the global level. The Samoa Pathway also called for supporting efforts by small island developing States to strengthen resilience to the impacts of climate change and to improve their adaptive capacity through the design and implementation of measures appropriate to their respective vulnerabilities and economic  environmental and social situations.  In particular  developed countries were urged to increase technology  finance and capacity-building support to enable increased mitigation ambition and adaptation actions on the part of developing countries. Also by the text  support was expressed for actions to develop a strategy and targeted measures for SIDS to promote energy efficiency and foster sustainable energy systems based on all energy sources  in particular  renewables such as wind  sustainable biomass  solar  hydroelectric  biofuel and geothermal energy. World leaders also supported efforts to implement the 2005-2015 Hyogo Framework for Action on disaster risk reduction and work for an ambitious renewed international framework beyond that period. They strongly committed to promote and support national  subregional and regional efforts to assess  conserve  protect  manage and sustainably use the oceans  seas and their resources by assisting research and the implementation of strategies on coastal-zone and ecosystem-based management. In line with the Conference theme  “The sustainable development of small island developing States through genuine and durable partnerships ” the text highlighted an urgent need to strengthen international cooperation and ensure such partnerships at the national  regional and international levels. Accordingly  the United Nations Secretary-General was requested to present recommendations for a partnership framework to monitor and ensure the full implementation of pledges and commitments.  Those proposals should be presented to the General Assembly for consideration and action at its sixty‑ninth session. In closing remarks  Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi  Prime Minister of Samoa and President of the Conference  expressed hope that delegates had developed a deeper appreciation and empathy for the realities of small island developing States in a global arena of competing priorities and demands  where those with influence and resources were the winners.  The Conference was not the last of global responses to SIDS’ development challenges  but an important launch pad for ways to use the few resources available to raise living standards in their communities.  The Climate Change Summit to be held on 23 September at United Nations Headquarters in New York would serve as an essential forerunner to the Lima and Paris negotiations for an ambitious climate change treaty in 2015.  Inclusion of SIDS concerns and aims in the Paris treaty were a top priority. Equally important  he said  was the Third Global Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction  to be held in Japan in March 2015.  As the focus shifted from the vulnerabilities of small island developing States to building their resilience  any decisions on the matter must be done in consultation with those States.  The concerns of SIDS must also be included in the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda.  He expressed hope that the Samoa Pathway outcome document would be a blueprint for immediate action  not just a reference point until the next SIDS conference.  “The time for speeches is over.  We must now set sail with determination that the course of action we have chartered here will be delivered to achieve our priorities ” he said. Wu Hongbo  Secretary-General of the Conference and United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs  also delivered closing remarks  stressing that the outcome document represented the international community’s renewed political commitment to the sustainable development of small island developing States. Prior to the text’s adoption  the Conference heard 33 speakers in the general debate  and after its adoption  the representative of the United States said he would issue a full written statement in explanation of his country’s position.  Delegates also adopted the report of the Conference  as well as the resolution titled “Expression of thanks to the people and Government of Samoa” (documents A/CONF.223/L.2  A/CONF.223/L.3 and A/CONF.223/CRP.1). Freundel Stuart  Prime Minister of Barbados; Federico Ramos de Armas  Secretary of State for Environment of Spain; Dennis Francis  Director  Directorate for Multilateral Relations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Trinidad and Tobago; Simona-Mirela Miculescu (Romania); Milan Meetarbhan (Mauritius); and Ronald Jean Jumeau (Seychelles) reported on the discussions in the thematic multi-stakeholder partnership dialogues held in parallel to the plenary meetings. Speaking in the general debate today was a representative of Libya  as well as representatives of the following: the Pacific Islands Forum  Global Environment Facility  Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency  Secretariat of the Pacific Community  Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme  International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)  South Centre  Indian Ocean Commission  International Organization of la Francophonie  World Bank Group  United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women)  United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR)  United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries  Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States  and the Convention on Biological Diversity Secretariat. Also  the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification Secretariat  International Telecommunication Union (ITU)  United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)  United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)  International Monetary Fund (IMF)  Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)  Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)  Asian Development Bank  African  Caribbean and Pacific Group States  International Labour Organization (ILO)  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat  and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Speaking for major groups were representatives of the Caribbean Policy Development Centre (on behalf of the non-governmental organizations major group)  Conseil Régional de la Réunion (on behalf of the local authorities major group)  the Caribbean Farmers' Network (on behalf of the farmers major group) and the Pacific Islands Private Sector Organization (on behalf of the business and industry major group). Summary of Multi-Stakeholder Partnership Dialogue FONOTOE NUAFESILI PIERRE LAUOFO  Deputy Prime Minister of Samoa and ex-officio Vice-President of the Conference  briefing on the 3 September multi-stakeholder partnership dialogue on oceans  seas and biodiversity  said oceans were part of daily life in small island developing States and contributed greatly to their economic activity  particularly through fisheries and tourism.  However  the unsustainable use of marine resources — including overfishing for commercial purposes and illegal and unregistered fishing — had led to a rapid decline in fish stocks.  It was essential to achieve the sustainable use of marine resources  so as to ensure long-term food security and protect rich marine biodiversity.  Integrated  holistic and global approaches should be taken to effectively manage coastal and marine areas.  SIDS  he went on  had an intrinsic economic  social  cultural and environmental connection with oceans and seas  and therefore were well placed to develop sustainable ocean-based economies.  Integrated ecosystem approaches to the management and governance of ocean spaces and activities must be adopted through partnerships.  Those partnerships had been recognized as those related to ocean acidification; a global ocean carbon observatory network; conservation in the Caribbean; strategic cooperation with small island developing States on biodiversity and forestry; marine scientific cooperation; marine capacity-building; and effective management of marine areas. Statements TUILOMA NERONI SLADE  Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum  said his organization was poised to implement the Samoa Pathway document and its members had been involved in the global debate on sustainable development in the context of small island developing States.  The endorsement by Pacific leaders in August in Palau of the Framework for Pacific Regionalism had reinvigorated the agenda for regional cooperation and integration.  Sustainable financing for SIDS must be central  and the criteria for graduation from least-developed-country status must be reviewed to better reflect such States’ vulnerabilities to external economic and physical shocks.  New sources of funding were needed.  The Forum would continue to implement the Forum Compact on Strengthening Development Coordination. RAWLESTON MOORE  the Global Environment Facility  said that  in the coming years  the Facility was seeking to ramp up its investment in renewable energy for small island developing States and collaborate with a broad array of stakeholders to put programmes in place.  Since 1994  the Facility had provided nearly $1 billion in support of sustainable development in such States  and its new four-year funding cycle included the largest amount of resources ever provided for small island developing States.  For 2014-2018  the Facility would make available $256 million for projects to improve the environment  a 9 per cent increase from the previous four-year period.  JAMES MOVICK  Director-General of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency  noting that islands in the Pacific were highly dependent on fisheries  said that per-capita consumption of seafood in some atoll countries was among the highest in the world.  Due to population growth  many countries were expected to face a deficit in the local fish supply in the next 20 years of 100 000 tons.  In the long term  climate change was expected to reduce potential fish production.  He called for the recognition of the rights of coastal States to control fishing opportunities within their own waters; implementation of best practices fisheries management; the removal of overcapacity in the regional and global industrial fishing fleet; effective management of high seas areas; and more consistent support from the international community in terms of their development agendas and their approach to regional fisheries management and trade negotiations. COLIN TUKUITONGA  Director-General of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community  said that a key element for the Pacific region was being able to measure progress and monitor implementation.  The Pacific Community had worked for several years in enhancing national statistical systems and  through the national minimum development indicators database  would continue to work with countries to meet those implementation and monitoring commitments.  The final chapters of the Samoa Pathway called for special attention to implementation  data and statistics  and institutional support for small island developing States  and in an effort to effectively support various institutional mechanisms  the Pacific Community had applied to become a permanent observer to the United Nations. DAVID SHEPPARD  Director-General of the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme  noting that his organization’s vision was to embrace all three pillars of sustainable development  echoed the United Nations Secretary-General’s concern over sea-level rise.  The Marshall Islands  Tuvalu and Kiribati were the lowest-lying islands on Earth.  The Pacific islands contributed 0.03 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions  but would be the first to go under if the dire forecasts of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change came to pass.  The international community must support all island countries to become more resilient  and his Programme worked to build such resilience through the practical implementation of climate adaptation in water  food security and coastal zone management in order to protect and better manage natural ecosystems and island biodiversity  and help countries better manage waste.  He invited all delegates to work on the Programme’s campaign theme of “Natural solutions — building resilience for a changing Pacific”. FILIPE NAINOCA  Secretary-General of the Fiji Red Cross Society  on behalf of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)  said that to create a platform for sustainable growth and poverty eradication  his organization urged Governments  donors and partners to consider a number of actions  including building the capacity and resilience of local institutions for effective partnerships by recognizing the role of volunteers  both in national laws and through support and training; integrating disaster risk reduction and climate change plans into national  regional and international frameworks to enhance development outcomes; making legal frameworks part of disaster preparedness; and investing in and involving youth. MARIAMA WILLIAMS  the South Centre  said the outcome document from Samoa must chart a definitive path forward  building on the foundations of internationally agreed SIDS-specific goals in the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy.  The Samoa Pathway must push the envelope so that small island developing States could participate in more democratic and inclusive global governance arrangements.  The strategy must focus on an international sovereign debt restructuring mechanism that provided preferential treatment for their socioeconomic development  as well as new  adequate and predictable flows of climate finance accessible through simplified direct access methods and driven by SIDS-related adaptation and climate-related needs. JEAN CLAUDE DE L’ESTRAC  Secretary-General of the Indian Ocean Commission  recalling that Member States had repeatedly stressed the inherent vulnerabilities of small island developing States during the Conference  said that those concerns represented a turning point for the future of sustainable development in SIDS.  People in those States were living in an economic and environmental emergency that required differentiated treatment.  Defining and recognizing small island developing States as a category within the United Nations was a precondition to addressing their challenges  and that special treatment should facilitate access by SIDS to new sources of multilateral funding. TANNAO KIRI  International Organization of La Francophonie  stressed the need to establish a global economic system that respected the fact that while nations had different capacities  they all had the same rights.  La Francophonie had provided support that had enabled small island developing States to improve their coordination.  He called for strengthening the United Nations agencies that placed sustainable development at the core of their objectives.  Supporting national strategies for sustainable development in SIDS was crucial.  To boost tourism  a major income generator in many SIDS  his organization had promoted tourism’s benefit to local communities and the role of sustainable ecotourism in preserving biodiversity.  He stressed the importance of developing tools to generate sustainable tourism to tackle SIDS-related challenges in a cross-cutting fashion.  La Francophonie supported the Samoa Pathway outcome document and would do its part to contribute to its implementation and success. RACHEL KYTE  World Bank Group  said that in recognition of the unique vulnerabilities and challenges facing small island developing States  the Group had tailored national and regional programmes to help SIDS assess social and structural sources of vulnerability  address underlying policy and institutional weakness and build resilience to respond to and manage the effects of global shocks  climate change and natural hazards.  Fourteen small island developing States had access to International Development Association concessional financing under the small islands economies exception despite having gross national income per-capita levels on average four times the Association’s operational cut-off. ROBERTA CLARKE  Executive Director of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women)  said it was vital to end historic  persistent exclusions and to ensure women had equal opportunities to participate in  influence and benefit from political  social and economic governance.  Ensuring women’s and girls’ voices would be a primary indicator of accountability for commitments made in the post-2015 and SIDS agendas.  To meet the goals set forth in the Samoa Pathway outcome document  it was necessary to end all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls  strengthen women’s economic power and ensure their access to productive employment  decent work  ownership and control of land  credit  natural resources  sexual and reproductive health and decision-making processes. WENDY WATSON-WRIGHT  the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  said small island developing States stood on the frontline of change and provided early warnings for the world against global problems.  The Conference carried a strategic weight as it was held ahead of the adoption of a post-2015 development agenda  and she noted that science held the key to the successful sustainable development of small island developing States.  She urged those States to encourage their youth to pursue a career in science.  Traditional knowledge held by indigenous people was also vital  as was a quality education. TIMOTH WILCOX  the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR)  said the Samoa Pathway outcome document was a clear sign that the international community was ready to support small island developing States and to build upon existing achievements towards preventing and managing disaster risk.  The Pacific region led the global effort in integrating climate change adaptation and disaster risk management into one strategic approach.  To address bottlenecks in that regard  the Secretary-General would announce more support measures for the region next month.  His Office welcomed the recognition of the Hyogo Framework for Action in the Samoa Pathway document and called on leaders of small island developing States to bring the message of that document to the upcoming United Nations Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction  in Sendai  Japan. GYAN CHANDRA ACHARYA  Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for the Least Developed Countries  Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States  said that in preparations for the Conference  his Office had organized events on marine science and technology transfer to small island developing States  partnerships in disaster risk reduction and resilience for food and nutrition in small islands.  Recently  his Office partnered with Apple iTunes in an “Island Voices” project featuring a number of artists and music from island States across the globe. BRAULIO FERREIRA DE SOUZA DIAS  Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity Secretariat  said that according to the soon-to-be-released fourth edition of the Global Biodiversity Outlook report  since 2010  national Governments  especially small island developing States  had invested more to address the unacceptable rate of global biodiversity loss.  He noted that by mainstreaming ecosystem services into the larger development agenda  the innovative practices of SIDS in community-based fisheries  integrated coastal and marine ecosystem management and public-private partnerships in tourism had shown that initiatives to stem such loss were possible and expanding.  Still  actual biodiversity loss was accelerating  compounded by climate change  pollution  invasive alien species and the loss of critical ecosystems.  He urged small island developing States to submit to the Convention Secretariat their updated national biodiversity plans in order to identify their scientific and technical cooperation needs  and to ratify the Nagoya Protocol to benefit from the sustainable use of their genetic resources and traditional knowledge in international cooperation and development. MESBAH ABDELKADER ELLAFI ( Libya) said the survival of small island developing States was at stake and measures were needed to mitigate risk.  Those who had financial  technological and other resources should  in the spirit of solidarity  provide those resources to assist SIDS.  The Samoa Pathway outcome document was a point of departure for effective implementation of sustainable development measures for those States. MELCHIADE BUKURU  the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification Secretariat  noting that all small island developing States were parties to the Convention  said those States received substantial support for sustainable land management projects  notably from the Global Environment Facility.  For the first time  SIDS were recognizing that addressing land degradation would be critical to their food security  adaptation to climate change  protection of biodiversity and resilience to natural hazards.  Citing a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report  he said that SIDS were reaching the limit of their land capacity as most had limited land resources.  The loss of just one hectare of productive land was a substantial loss for them  and that land-based adaptation activities  notably through sustainable land management  were vital.  He invited SIDS to use 2015  the year in which the international community was poised to agree on a new development agenda and climate change regime  to secure provisions for land-based adaptation to climate change. BRAHIMA SANOU  the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)  speaking of the correlation between economic progress in small island developing States and the rapid growth of information and communications technology  said that SIDS two decades ago had not been as connected as they were today.  In 1994  less than 1 per cent of the population across small island developing States had mobile-cellular subscriptions  but today that level exceeded 80 per cent.  Internet usage had increased from 0.1 per cent in 1994 to 35 per cent in 2014.  Even when small island developing States graduated from least developed countries status  the Union would accompany them on their development journey with unwavering support.  “We won’t penalize success.  We reward it.” OLAV KJØRVEN  the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  noted the agency’s specific support for small island developing States  citing a joint initiative with 14 Pacific island countries to end preventable child and maternal deaths.  There must be a clear  central focus on ensuring the survival of children from those States.  By 2020  an estimated 175 million children would likely be affected annually by climate change-related disasters  and a strong global climate agreement in 2015 that was capable of safeguarding the future of SIDS and their development would be essential for those nations’ children.  A quality education was particularly important in geographically and economically isolated island States  as was breaking the cycle of high rates of violence against children and women.  There must be a specific target in the post‑2015 development agenda on eliminating abuse  exploitation and all forms of violence against children.  The issues of health  nutrition  water and sanitation should be “headline” goals in the final report of the Open-Ended Working Group on the Sustainable Development Goals and the Samoa Pathway document. LAURENT ZESSLER  the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)  said his agency had provided commodities for reproductive health and family planning to small island developing States and was leading efforts to ensure that the specific needs of women and girls in SIDS were carefully considered.  Climate change had been the focus of the Conference and rightly so.  If the core of adaptation to climate change was a resilient  secure and empowered people  then reproductive health was a prerequisite.  Universal access to reproductive health was fundamental to sustainable development as it prevented early marriage and early pregnancy  and ensured educational attainment  particularly for women and girls. PRADEEP MONGA  the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)  said that together with “SIDS Dock” and Austria  the agency had recently launched an innovative South-South partnership to create a network of regional sustainable energy centres for small island developing States in Africa  the Caribbean  the Pacific and the Indian Ocean.  UNIDO had assisted the Secretariat of the Pacific Community and the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency  raising awareness for the potential fisheries could have towards improving the livelihoods and food security in the Pacific region.  He noted that the agency had today signed a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Barbados to promote eco-friendly innovative industrial infrastructure and clean energy technologies. XAVIER MARET  the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  said his organization had partnered with small island developing States — including Antigua and Barbuda  Saint Kitts and Nevis  Grenada  the Solomon Islands  Comoros and Sao Tome and Principe — in  support of their efforts to come out of the global financial crisis that had broken in 2008.  Further  IMF had helped some countries  including Haiti  Dominica  Saint Lucia  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the Solomon Islands  to get back on their feet following the devastation caused by natural hazards.  To better support its member countries  IMF had increased its lending capacity and approved in 2009 a major overhaul of its lending facilities framework by offering higher amounts and tailoring loan terms to countries’ varying strengths and circumstances.  The non-concessional Rapid Financing Instrument had been introduced to replace and broaden the scope of earlier emergency assistance facility  and criteria to qualify for concessional lending under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust had been eased in 2013.  The latter measure had allowed the Marshall Islands  the Federated States of Micronesia and Tuvalu to be eligible  and also kept Dominica and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines eligible — which would otherwise have graduated. SHAMSHAD AKHTAR  Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)  said the Commission had been working to implement the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy  trying to deepen and sharpen regional support for small island developing States.  The Samoa Pathway document reinforced the role of regional commissions  institutions and bodies in laying out a road map for sustainable development.  The role of ESCAP was to reinforce the Samoa Pathway  and it would nurture stronger regional solidarity among small island developing States.  In regards to policymaking  ESCAP was trying to equip Pacific economies in an effort to place them on the path towards sustainable green growth  and it had worked with Pacific regional bodies to implement that goal.  The Commission aimed to nurture connectivity for sustainable maritime development  bolster national disaster risk reduction efforts and create subregional statistics on the Millennium Development Goals for the Pacific region. TIME RWABUNEMBA  the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)  said the world had seen record-breaking declines in new HIV infections — a 38 per cent drop since 2001.  Further  AIDS-related deaths were at their lowest levels  down 35 per cent since 2005.  Small island developing States had done relatively well.  Haiti had seen a 44 per cent drop in HIV infections since 2005  while many Pacific island countries and territories had experienced a low-level HIV epidemic.  Five countries — the Cook Islands  Nauru  Niue  Tokelau and Pitcairn — had reported having no people living with HIV.  Progress was fragile and gains need to be sustained.  Now was not the time for complacency  given the context of serious global challenges. STEPHEN GRAFF  the Asian Development Bank  noting that 14 small island developing States were members of the institution  said the Bank in the last decade had almost quadrupled its portfolio of operations in such States  from $500 million to $1.9 billion.  As well as providing cheap concessional financing  the Bank was now providing grants for many of the most vulnerable countries.  It had helped SIDS respond to the global economic crises of 2008 and 2009  and in the past five years  had played a central role working with partners — including Australia  New Zealand  the World Bank and the European Union — to provide flexible budget support  helping SIDS rebuild buffers and maintain essential health and education services during an economic downturn.  The Bank was the largest single source of financing for renewable energy among its SIDS members  financing 5 per cent of those nations’ total renewable energy capacity in the past three years. ACHILLE BASSILEKIN  the African  Caribbean and Pacific Group of States  said he trusted that the means of implementation of the Samoa Pathway outcome document would be adequately addressed to ensure that it could be and would be implemented and not just mere words put together to ensure that those with the greatest responsibility could have an escape route not to fulfil their commitments and obligations. New  additional and predictable financial resources were urgently needed to effectively respond to the development challenges of small island developing States. ROBERT KYLOH  the International Labour Organization (ILO)  welcomed the Conference discussions and said that the Samoa Pathway outcome document had addressed the need for sustained economic growth with decent work for all.  Given that the ability of small island developing States to sustain high levels of economic growth and job creation had been adversely affected by several factors  they warranted the international community’s strong support.  Youth unemployment was critical in SIDS and was associated with high levels of crime and drugs  and investment in high-quality training and education was essential to any component for tackling that  as were policies and programmes that directly created more jobs.  ILO engaged heavily in direct job creation with construction of rural road and infrastructure among poor communities in SIDS.  Migrant workers played an important role in enhancing development of their home communities.  Growth must be inclusive and equitable  and to ensure that  the introduction of a social protection floor  appropriate wages and labour bargaining rights was vital. SHANTAL MUNRO KNIGHT  the Caribbean Policy Development Centre  speaking on behalf of the non-governmental organizations major group  said that non-governmental groups were critical partners who brought wide and varying capacities to the process.  They were service providers  innovators  capacity-builders and -mobilizers  policy advocates and technical experts.  They contributed tangibly to the small island developing States agenda  but their work and value often went unacknowledged.  Her group called for the reformulation of the global governance architecture to give small island developing States an equitable voice in international decision-making processes on climate change  economic development  social development  human rights and environmental conservation  as well as the creation of an enabling environment for civil society engagement at all levels of governance in sustainable development processes. FLORENCE PIGNOLET TARDAN  Conseil Régional de la Réunion  speaking on behalf of the local authorities major group  said it worked to develop South-South cooperation  including among small island developing States of the Indian Ocean.  The islands had devised a draft declaration on climate change  which called for recognition that they played a watchdog role in climate change.  The group called for solidarity with small island developing States and mechanisms to enable those States to adapt to and mitigate climate change.  Further  they proposed establishment of a vulnerability resilience index for islands to prioritize financing  a debt relief initiative devised by the Government of the Seychelles and the Paris Club  creation of an energy hub for the Indian Ocean for the transfer of skills  and development of a low-carbon economy.  That initiative showed the dynamism and commitment of SIDS and inter-State authorities in combating climate change and the desire to make the transition towards a sustainable energy-efficient economy. PAMELA THOMAS  the Caribbean Farmers' Network  speaking on behalf of the farmers major group  said that investment in agriculture had declined for several years across many small island developing States  particularly those in the Caribbean region.  After the food-price crisis of 2008  Governments  donors and institutions had made agriculture a priority.  However  climate change impacts  such as flooding  drought and higher temperatures  had affected agricultural production and the livelihood of farmers across small island developing States.  Those countries must develop and design support mechanisms and infrastructure that facilitated the setting up of climate smart farms  thereby creating a more sustainable agricultural sector and advancing Caribbean food security.  That would mean engaging in partnership agreements  dialogues and adaptive strategies to lessen the yield losses and avert food insecurity in the region. KLAUS STUNZNER  the Pacific Islands Private Sector Organization  speaking on behalf of the business and industry major group  said that prior to the Conference  the Samoa Chamber of Commerce  the Government and the United Nations Office of the High Representative for Least Developed Countries  Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States had convened a private-sector partnerships forum.  Some 400 participants from various sectors had focused on seven thematic areas: oceans and marine resources; connectivity; sustainable agriculture; sustainable tourism; disaster risk reduction; renewable energy; and financing and support measures for the SIDS private sector.  Approximately 20 concrete partnerships  initiatives and recommendations had been announced  and a SIDS global network had been established.  The industry welcomed the Conference outcome  particularly the section on sustained and sustainable inclusive and equitable economic growth with decent work for all. DANIELE VIOLETTI  the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  said the world had become cognizant of the challenges in keeping the rise in global temperature to less than 2°C  and to tackle climate change  it was necessary to achieve climate neutrality by balancing carbon emissions with an equal amount sequestered of offset.  National policies must move every country towards reducing emissions and supporting a new climate agreement.  For that to happen  business must be on board.  Investment and industry must wake up to the fact that action on climate change was needed  that renewable energy and energy efficiency were wise investments and that green bonds were safer for investors in the long term.  The public must join the solution as businesses and Governments could not act alone.  Tokelau was the first country run completely on renewable energy.  So many countries during the Conference had announced similar ambitious targets and island States were taking the lead in that regard through partnerships to show that a climate-safe future was a prosperous future. LUCINDA LONGCROFT  the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)  said her agency was mandated to promote and develop a balanced international intellectual property system for the cultural  economic and social development of all countries.  WIPO  with its 187 member States  supported capacity-development at the national level and efforts to use intellectual property as a tool towards meeting national development policy goals.  The agency was committed to helping small island developing States use their wealth of cultural and innovative resources to meet their development challenges and goals  and she noted that its partnerships in those States took many forms both in cultural and technological sectors.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-09-22,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11554.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Committing to further advance the rights of indigenous peoples  global leaders today called for actions that would bridge the gap between promises and results at the first-ever international conference on that disadvantaged group. Unanimously adopting a landmark Outcome Document at the General Assembly gathering  known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples  Heads of State and Government  ministers and other representatives highlighted the importance of obtaining “free  prior and informed consent” from indigenous peoples on matters that affected them  including legislative measures and development projects. The text also underscored the United Nations’ role in promoting and protecting indigenous peoples’ rights  including in the development and implementation of national action plans  strategies or other measures that affect them  in order to achieve the objectives of the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Today’s Document also urged intensified efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence and discrimination against the most vulnerable among that population  especially people with disabilities  youth  children  women and older persons. Further to the text  the Secretary-General was requested to begin the development of a system-wide action plan within existing resources to ensure a coherent approach to achieving the Declaration’s goals and to report to the General Assembly on the matter at its seventieth session.  He was also invited  by the end of that session  to appoint a United Nations senior official  with access to the highest levels of decision-making within the system  to coordinate the action plan and raise awareness of indigenous peoples’ rights. The Secretary-General was also asked  by that session  to report on the Outcome Document’s implementation and to make recommendations on how to use  modify and improve existing United Nations mechanisms to achieve the Declaration’s objectives  as well as ways to enhance a coherent  system-wide approach.  The text also asked for specific proposals to enable the participation of indigenous peoples’ representatives and institutions on issues that affected them. Addressing the meeting prior to adoption of the text  the Secretary-General said that while meeting recently with Maori leaders in New Zealand  he was impressed by their multimillion dollar horticulture  waste management and energy production companies and how every bit of waste was fed to worms  which  in turn  created very rich organic fertilizer.  That was “sustainability in action”  which could be replicated elsewhere.  The Outcome Document contained commitments to actions that would bridge the gap between promises and results  he said  welcoming the direct requests made to him. Also in opening remarks  Sam Kutesa  General Assembly President  said indigenous peoples’ issues had been a preoccupation of the United Nations for more than 30 years.  The Assembly’s 2007 adoption of the Declaration represented a “global consensus” on those peoples’ rights  including that of self-determination.  But with a deep chasm still separating reality from commitments  policies  and legislative actions  the Outcome Document comprised many action-oriented commitments directed towards addressing the implementation gaps. Enrique Peña Nieto  President of Mexico  speaking on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean Group  described the final document as “a road map to reposition indigenous peoples” in the United Nations agenda. Evo Morales Ayma  President of Bolivia  noting that the fundamental principles of indigenous peoples were life  Mother Earth and peace  said that those were threatened by the capitalist system.  In Bolivia  the indigenous movement was now able  not only to vote  but also govern.  Climate change had become one of the most serious problems facing the planet  and the best way to fight it was to base action on the experiences of indigenous peoples  as they knew how to live in harmony with Mother Earth. Zeid Ra’ad Al-Hussein  United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  spotlighted some statistics that suggested that indigenous peoples were more vulnerable to human rights violations.  Developed countries had a disproportionately high percentage of indigenous people in prison  he said  noting that  in one country  indigenous children were 25 times more likely to be in detention than children elsewhere. The Conference held two round-table discussions this afternoon on  respectively  “United Nations system action for the implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples” and “implementing the rights of indigenous peoples at the national and local level”. Also delivering statements in the opening session were Sauli Niinistö  President of Finland (on behalf of the Western European and Other Group); Toomas Hendrik Ilves  President of Estonia (on behalf of the Group of Eastern European States); Henri Djombo  Minister of Forest Economy and Sustainable Development of the Congo (on behalf of the Group of African States); Oren Lyons  Jr.  Chief of the Onondaga Nation Council of Chiefs; Aili Keskitalo  President of the Saami Parliament of Norway; Luis Evelis  Member of the Senate of Colombia; Dalee Sambo Dorough  Chairperson of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues; and Rigoberta Menchú  indigenous leader and Nobel Laureate. Speaking after adoption of the Outcome Document were an observer for the Holy See and the representative of Canada. Chief Sidd Hill of the Haudenosaunee opened the meeting with a traditional prayer. The Conference will meet again tomorrow at 3 p.m. for its conclusion. Opening Remarks SAM KUTESA  General Assembly President  said indigenous peoples’ issues had been a preoccupation of the United Nations for more than 30 years.  The General Assembly’s 2007 adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples represented a “global consensus” on those peoples’ rights  including that of self-determination. Nevertheless  he said  a deep chasm still separated reality from commitments  policies  and legislative actions aiming to improve the lives of indigenous peoples.  Today’s World Conference should serve as “a turning point” for translating the Declaration into concrete action.  The carefully crafted Outcome Document  which includes a system-wide action plan to ensure coherence in efforts towards realizing the Declaration’s provisions  comprises many action-oriented commitments directed towards addressing the implementation gaps  he said  adding that Member States must make greater efforts to translate it into reality. BAN KI-MOON  Secretary-General of the United Nations  said that today’s conference connected so much of the Organization’s critical work this week.  Indigenous peoples were concerned about issues that topped the global agenda and were deeply connected to Mother Earth  whose future was at the heart of the Climate Summit opening tomorrow.  Indigenous peoples were also central to human rights and global development discourse.  In talks with indigenous leaders in Costa Rica  he had found that they were worried about land  resources and rights.  He pledged to address the exclusion and marginalization facing indigenous peoples worldwide. Also  while meeting with Maori leaders in New Zealand earlier in the month  he had been impressed by their multi-million dollar horticulture  waste-management and energy-production companies and how every bit of waste was fed to worms  which  in turn  created very rich organic fertilizer.  That was “sustainability in action”  he said  adding that it showed what could be learned from indigenous peoples.  The General Assembly had adopted the Declaration during his first year in office.  That text had set minimum standards for the survival  well-being and dignity of indigenous peoples; it had also led more countries to reflect those principles in their laws and constitutions and increasingly encouraged United Nations agencies to develop specific policies. The Outcome Document before the Assembly today contained commitments to actions that would bridge the gap between promises and results  he said  welcoming its direct requests to him  including the development of concrete proposals to enable indigenous peoples and their institutions to participate more directly in United Nations activities.  He said he would also give serious consideration to a request to appoint a high-level official on indigenous peoples.  Quoting a long-time indigenous activist  he said that indigenous peoples  despite many different languages spoken among their communities  were speaking one language  and their relationship to Mother Earth was identical. EVO MORALES AYMA  President of Bolivia  said that the fundamental principles of indigenous peoples were life  Mother Earth  and peace.  Those tenets  however  were being threatened by the capitalist system  he said  adding that he was here today at the first official summit of the United Nations on indigenous peoples to share some experiences from his tenure in Bolivia. In Bolivia  he said  the indigenous movement was now able not only to vote but also govern.  Natural resources from Mother Earth should benefit everyone  he said  adding that in Bolivia  revenue from oil sales had doubled after the industry was nationalized.  With nationalization  Bolivia had freed itself from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank  which had determined the country’s economic policies.  Climate change had become one of the most serious problems facing the planet  he said  asserting that the best way to fight it was to base action on the experiences of indigenous peoples  who knew how to live in harmony with Mother Earth.  They had learned to live in harmony and balance with the earth and believed today’s Conference should be a starting point in the process of transformation and change based on indigenous knowledge. SAULI NIINISTÖ  President of Finland  speaking on behalf of the Western European and Other Group  said the conference marked an important step in fulfilling a key recommendation made in Alta a year ago.  Indigenous peoples should have the right to participate in the United Nations in matters that concerned them.  In that regard  the international community must express concern over reported attempts to prevent the representatives of indigenous people from the Russian Federation to join today’s conference.  Also vital was indigenous peoples’ participation in decision-making at the national level.  In Finland  authorities were obliged by law to negotiate with the Saami Parliament  the legislative body representing the indigenous Saami.  Recently  the Finnish Government had worked together with the Saami Parliament to expand the scope of the obligation to consult  with the proposed reform spelling out the concept of free  prior and informed consent. He said it was also critical that indigenous youth had the rights  means and support to participate in their societies.  To that end  access to education  information and means of communication were essential.  In his country  Saami youth had taken significant steps to increase their participation in cultural and political activities through the establishment of a youth council.  Measures to revive indigenous languages were an efficient way to strengthen the youth’s identity. HENRI DJOMBO  Minister of Forest Economy and Sustainable Development of the Congo  speaking on behalf of the Group of African States  stressed the importance of inclusive processes on matters affecting indigenous peoples.  “They are the participants and the subject ” he said  noting that they had participated actively in the preparatory processes leading up to today’s conference and made invaluable contributions to the Outcome Document.  The history of indigenous peoples in Africa varied from one country to another  and the marginalized among them required special protection.  African States had also participated in the preparatory processes and offered many ideas. He said that the Declaration  upon its adoption in 2007  had received strong support from African States  and marked a victory after more than two decades of battle for indigenous peoples.  More African States now recognized indigenous peoples as “first citizens”.  In February 2011  his Government had also enacted a law that set standards to promote and protect the rights of indigenous peoples.  The impact had been ground-breaking and tangible.  That had been followed by a new action plan in 2013  which aimed to improve the lives of indigenous peoples and ensure that they enjoyed the dividends of development.  The plan also ensured free  prior and informed consent on matters that affected them.  “The path to equality is a long one ” he said  expressing commitment to work with the United Nations to address issues affecting marginalized indigenous peoples. TOOMAS HENDRIK ILVES  President of Estonia  speaking on behalf of the Group of Eastern European States  said that Estonians had stood on both sides  as both an oppressed indigenous people and as members of the United Nations.  It was bizarre and shameful that some States had attempted to hinder indigenous peoples from participating in the Organization’s conferences.  The rights of indigenous peoples must be respected  he said  noting that the majority of States did so  but in many countries  material gains were prioritized over indigenous rights.  In other words  profit was pursued at the expense of culture. He spoke of the situation of indigenous peoples in his region  and thanked various nations for their concern  as they always sought to include indigenous peoples in their delegations.  He associated himself with the statement by the President of Finland regarding the inability of the Kola Saami to participate in the meeting.  The international community was obliged to do everything it could to support indigenous peoples  he said  adding  “Wherever they live  they must all be acknowledged.  We must learn to listen to the voices which have been silenced too long.” ENRIQUE PEÑA NIETO  President of Mexico  speaking on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean States  pledged a permanent commitment to support indigenous peoples worldwide  applauding the 2010 General Assembly resolution that mandated the convening of today’s meeting.  With a population of 45 million indigenous peoples  the Latin American and Caribbean region was linguistically diverse.  His Government had actively contributed to the preparatory process and negotiations on the Outcome Document for today’s conference  and the result was a product of open  inclusive and constructive dialogue that had included the participation of indigenous peoples.  Participants had made sure that the Outcome was in line with the Declaration  he said  describing the final document as “a road map to reposition indigenous peoples” in the United Nations agenda.  The post-2015 development agenda must also promote indigenous peoples’ rights. There were 5 000 distinct indigenous communities in the world  he said  urging each country to strengthen efforts to promote and protect their rights.  Mexico  with a population of 15 million indigenous peoples  recognized their right to self-determination and ensured non-discrimination against them.  A national policy was in place for the creation of better opportunities for them  ensuring access to education  health services  and justice.  Their products and handcrafts were also promoted  and his Government had established direct dialogue with indigenous communities to define public policy. OREN LYONS  JR.  Chief of the Onondaga Nation Council of Chiefs  greeted participants with a question about how to instruct 7 billion people on indigenous people’s relationship with the Earth.  The question was fundamental to humanity’s existence  and today’s generation would make the decision as to whether the species would survive.  Indigenous peoples were keepers of tradition.  One from Greenland had come with a message:  “The ice is melting”; thousands of feet had been lost at a pace that was accelerating. There must be reconciliation between all groups  he said  between nations and between corporations and nature.  Indigenous peoples believed in the order of the universe and the laws of creation  and that all life was bound by those tenets.  Indigenous peoples had suffered for generations  but were here today to include their voices in a plea for sanity.  There could be no peace as long as war was waged against the Earth  he said  urging that this crisis be addressed now  while there was still time.  “And as we speak  the ice continues to melt in the north.”  In conclusion  he told delegates that his speech today was the same one he had given 14 years ago  yet with the passage of time little had been done. AILI KESKITALO  President of the Saami Parliament of Norway  said that indigenous peoples had historically been marginalized  discriminated against and ignored  but they had not lost heart.  The Declaration’s adoption had been historic.  Despite that milestone  the gap remained to be closed between theory and practice.  The small city of Alta in the traditional Saami territory in Norway had hosted the Global Indigenous Preparatory Meeting  which had been the culmination of a process begun at the local level. She welcomed the Outcome Document that resulted from today’s World Conference and its recognition of the need to ensure indigenous peoples’ participation at United Nations meetings on issues that affected them.  Paraphrasing a Saami proverb  she said that all bad things eventually would come to an end.  Adoption of the Outcome text was a “small  yet important step” towards “the dawn of the day” for indigenous peoples.  The international community must persevere towards a realization of the common aspiration for human rights  justice  dignity  integrity and cultural identity. LUIS EVELIS  Member of the Senate of Colombia  representing the Latin American and the Caribbean region on behalf of the Global Indigenous Coordinating Group  acknowledged the Alta Outcome Document in the process leading up to today’s Outcome Document  particularly the fundamental principles and aspirations of indigenous peoples.  He was pleased to see many of its important provisions in the Outcome text.  Those tenets conformed to the Declaration and ensured the exercise of the fundamental collective rights of indigenous peoples  especially to land  territories and resources  which underpinned their well-being  and the right to freely determine their political status and pursue economic  social and cultural development. He stressed the need to work with Member States to establish mechanisms to ensure the implementation of the right and principle of free  prior and informed consent  particularly in the context of extractive industries and other major development projects affecting indigenous lands and territories.  He requested that Member States develop national processes to harmonize policies  laws and regulations with global instruments and commitments  in the framework of the Outcome Document  and with the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples. ZEID RA’AD AL-HUSSEIN  United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  said that in developed countries  the percentage of indigenous people in prison was highly disproportionate to their numbers.  In one country  indigenous children were 25 times more likely to be in detention than children elsewhere.  In Latin America and the Caribbean  indigenous children were three times more likely to not have access to education  safe drinking water or housing.  In Africa and Asia  indigenous young adults were more likely to be deprived of their right to education  especially if they were female.  In the Arctic  the Pacific and South-East Asia  indigenous women were at greater risk of death during pregnancy or childbirth than women from other communities  and their newborn and young children were also more likely to die.  Such stark statistics translated into thousands of human tragedies and thousands of human rights violations. He said that the World Conference and its Outcome Document were the stepping stones that would bring the work of the international community on indigenous peoples’ rights to a new level.  He called for a pledge from the world community to ensure that the human rights and dignity of all indigenous peoples were acknowledged and fully protected  in line with the Declaration.  The concerns and recommendations of indigenous peoples were essential to the Climate Summit and to the upcoming World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in 2015.  Natural disasters and the effects of climate change were often borne disproportionately by indigenous peoples  whose traditional knowledge could help mitigate the consequences. DALEE SAMBO DOROUGH  Chairperson of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues  said it was highly important to underscore not only the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter  but also the need for all parties to be mindful of the pertinent international legal obligations of Member States in relation to all peoples  including indigenous peoples.  She specifically emphasized the peremptory norms of international law and  in particular  the principle and right to self-determination  as affirmed by the Charter  and  among others  the international covenants and the Indigenous Peoples Declaration.  She said that consensus lost its validity if it was used to undermine the principles of justice  democracy  respect for human rights  equality  non-discrimination and good faith.  Good governance became a casualty if a few States or even one State was allowed to undermine such essential rights and principles at the global level.  In that regard  it was critical to recognize that indigenous peoples were among the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in the world.  Their human rights must not be politicized or otherwise undermined by local  regional and national State interests and agendas.  Rather  they must be respected and recognized.  The high-level meeting should be remembered for its contribution through a principled Outcome Document  and she called upon Member States to provide support for its effective implementation and mutually agreed upon terms of cooperation within the framework of the United Nations Declaration. RIGOBERTA MENCHÚ  indigenous leader and Nobel Laureate  said that 23 years ago  she had participated in the inaugural meeting of the working group on indigenous peoples.  Thanks to that group  progress had been made in discussions on the rights of indigenous peoples.  Since then  the United Nations had seen thousands of delegates come and go on the lead-up to the creation of the Permanent Forum.  Progress was being made in the area of indigenous peoples’ rights  she said  expressing her full support for the adoption of today’s Outcome Document.  The text would strengthen the action plans as well relationships among nations and nation-States. She said that many young people and children were suffering daily from the effects of violence in their communities  in attempts to protect their land and seas.  For indigenous people  peace was listening to various opinions  because “we are all part of one diversity.”  Over the course of the 34 years she had been linked to the United Nations  she said she had seen progress  but also frustration.  Indigenous people still lack basic services and rights  and if they were to achieve their freedom and self-determination  then all international standards must lead to dignified policies at the national level.  She paid tribute to other speakers and to all the young people participating in today’s meeting.     Action Following the opening statements  the Assembly adopted without a vote the draft resolution titled  “Outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples”. Speaking in explanation of position  the representative of the Permanent Observer Mission of Holy See expressed his delegation’s reservation on language regarding reproductive rights in operative paragraph 13. The representative of Canada said her delegation would table a short statement to explain its position and record some concerns. Round Table Discussion I Ghazali Ohorella  Representative of the Pacific Indigenous Region and Edita Hrda  Permanent Representative of the Czech Republic co-chaired the panel discussion  titled “United Nations system action for the implementation of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples”.  Panellists were Kanayo Nwanze  President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development; Victoria Tauli-Corpuz  Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; and Atencio Lopez  Representative of the Central and South America and the Caribbean Indigenous Region. Ms. HRDA commended efforts by Member States and representatives of indigenous peoples for having reached agreement on an outcome document.  The text represented a further step in the United Nations system in implementing its Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  he said. Mr. OHORELLA emphasized the important contribution to that text made by the preparatory meeting held in July 2013 in Alta  Norway.  The conference had found a realistic approach to be implemented at the national level.  Indigenous people had come a long way to see the Outcome text  which they had once thought impossible.  But there existed the gap between commitments and results. Dr. NWANZE said his agency  the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)  took indigenous peoples seriously.  They made up 5 per cent  or 370 million  of the world’s population.  They had struggled to preserve their identities  cultures and lands and had been neglected in the development process.  Their social and economic empowerment was vital to sustainable development and the creation of thriving communities.  Any global development agenda that ignored indigenous peoples was a “hollow exercise”. Policy did not mean anything unless it was matched with financial resources  he said  adding  “Let’s put money where the mouth is”.  His agency was providing $1.8 billion in loans to benefit indigenous peoples  and had set up the Indigenous Peoples Assistance Facility and created an indigenous peoples’ forum within the agency  which kept IFAD accountable  relevant and effective.  IFAD also had an internal fund to enable indigenous peoples to participate in this Conference.  Moreover  it supported the mainstreaming of indigenous peoples in sustainable development goals.  They had much to teach about ways to not jeopardize future generations. Ms. TAULI-CORPUZ said that indigenous concerns had become a cross-cutting issue in the United Nations system  acknowledging the role of the Permanent Forum.  Indigenous peoples’ interests were multifaceted  ranging from peace and security to human rights and the environment.  Indigenous peoples suffered equally from global problems  he said  urging the United Nations to take a more coherent approach to addressing the issues that affected them  including human rights violations so as to avoid marginalization in the development agenda.  Millennium Development Goals did not include indigenous peoples.  Unless United Nations actions were better coordinated  indigenous issues would always fall in the cracks. She was happy to see paragraphs in the Outcome Document that requested the Secretary-General to take specific actions  including the development of a system-wide action plan to ensure a coherent approach to achieving the goals of the Declaration.  Also welcome had been the call to appoint a senior official for coordinating the action plan and raising awareness of the rights of indigenous peoples.  The Secretary-General also had been asked to submit recommendations on how to use  modify and improve existing United Nations mechanisms to achieve the Declaration’s objectives  as well as ways to enhance a coherent  system-wide approach.  Regarding the monitoring implementation  she proposed that the United Nations hire more staff dedicated to implementing policy  and performance indicators should measure the number of those staff.  The senior official to be appointed should consult with indigenous peoples  she said  calling for an increase in dedicated resources to support the implementation of indigenous policy. Mr. LOPEZ commended the Outcome Document as something that indigenous peoples had dreamed about for a long time.  But he regretted that it had taken too long; many of his predecessors had already passed away without seeing the outcome.  After the Second World War  the Universal Declaration on Human Rights was adopted by the General Assembly  but the rights of indigenous peoples had not been respected.  They had to remain vocal about their problems because they were not the ones that implemented policies.  A great deal remained to be done.  Indigenous issues  now cross-cutting  required the engagement of many United Nations agencies. The Outcome Document  he said  reaffirmed the solemn commitment to respect  promote and advance indigenous peoples’ rights and uphold the principles of the Declaration.  But regrettably  the text had received a “frosty” reception in some parts of Latin America.  United Nations agencies should assume responsibility to implement the outcome by setting up funds to enable the participation of indigenous peoples in processes that affected them.  The United Nations should be a facilitator with full participation of indigenous representatives.  He recommended the inclusion of indigenous peoples in the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  Within the United Nations system  he liked to see an “Indigenous Ambassador”. When the floor opened for discussion  LUIS ALMAGRO  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay  said his country was homogenous but respected all ethnic minorities.  To that end  a census had been conducted to recognize minorities and reaffirm their rights. The representative of the Asia Caucus said that the Secretary-General should appoint an indigenous individual as a senior official on indigenous peoples  at a level not lower than that of Under-Secretary-General. The representative of the European Union Delegation hailed the Outcome Document as being inclusive and thus having broad ownership.  Coherent United Nations actions were vital and the Union  for its part  was reviewing its policies accordingly. ISABEL SAINT MALO DE ALVARADO  Vice-President and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Panama  said the country had five preservation areas for indigenous peoples  which encompassed 28 per cent of national territory.  Her Government had not ratified International Labour Organization Convention No. 169  but it recognized indigenous peoples in that context. The representative of National Indigenous Women’s Federation of Nepal urged each United Nations agency to develop or revise its indigenous peoples policy and develop implementation guidelines and performance indicators to make those fully compatible with the Declaration. The representative of the Inter-Agency Support Group on Indigenous Peoples Issues said that in addition to its work at the international level  country-specific dialogue between United Nations country teams  Governments and indigenous peoples was essential.  The United Nations Development Group Guidelines on Indigenous Peoples’ Issues was a tool to mainstream and integrate their issues in operational activities and programmes at the country level. Also delivering statements were speakers representing Pakistan  Spain  Hungary  France  United States  Viet Nam and Argentina. The representatives of the following United Nations entities and observers also spoke:  the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance  International Labour Organization (ILO)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)  Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity  United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC)  International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)  United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women). Also taking the floor were speakers representing the Arctic Caucus  Indigenous Persons with Disabilities Global Network  Cherokee Nation  Chief of the Chakma Circle  National Congress of Australia’s First Peoples  Mejlis of Crimean Tatar People  the Chickasaw Nation  Pacific Caucus  National Native Title Council  United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues  the Navajo Nation  Chippewas of the Thames First Nation in Canada (COTTFN)  International Indian Treaty Council  Citizen Potawatomi Nation  Pacific Disability Forum (Nepal Indigenous Disabled Association)  Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous People  National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center  Assyrian Universal Alliance  Americas Chapter  and Kalipunan ng Mga Katutubong Mamamayan ng Pilipinas. Round Table Discussion II David Choquehuanca  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bolivia and Joseph Ole Simmel  representative of the African Indigenous Region  co-chaired the panel on “Implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples at the national and local level”.  Panellists were James Anaya  former Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  and Soyata Maiga  Commissioner  African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights. Mr. ANAYA said the most formidable obstacle to fully implementing the indigenous peoples’ rights was ignorance — ignorance among the broader societies and political elites in the countries in which indigenous people lived.  That ignorance was manifested and perpetuated by mainstream media and popular stereotypes  which depicted indigenous peoples as relics of the past amid images of savagery or subjects of curiosity and romanticism.  As an example  he pointed to the pejorative use of the name “Redskins”  which is a United States-based professional football team.  Perhaps the greatest contributor to the widespread ignorance were mainstream educational systems  wherein the study of history regarded colonial and settler patterns as triumphant precursors to modern States  with little attention to the devastating consequences of those patterns for indigenous peoples in both the past and the present.  Instead  indigenous peoples had been cast into the roles of the savage or backward foe  of an obstacle to be overcome  or  alternatively  as the unwitting noble savage destined to succumb to modernity. While the Outcome Document adopted by consensus in the morning renewed Member States’ affirmation of the rights enshrined in the United Nations Declaration  he stressed that the commitment to implementing those rights must be accompanied by programmes in education and awareness-raising geared towards all of society.  Indigenous issues and realities must be mainstreamed into primary and secondary educational systems  he stressed.  Additionally  the media should be encouraged  and should itself adopt specific programmes  to become educated about indigenous peoples in relation to contemporary events.  Government authorities should be made aware of how their functions impacted and should impact on indigenous peoples.  Finally  indigenous peoples should be invited to contribute to such educational and awareness-raising efforts in the spirit of reconciliation  partnership and commitment to the human rights of all  as represented in the Declaration. Ms. MAIGA said that stereotypes of indigenous peoples’ behaviour had unfortunately contributed to discrimination against them.  Their resources were taken from them  they suffered from inadequate access to social services  among many other injustices.  The international community and the United Nations had alerted the world to that situation.  Regionally  the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights had been working tirelessly to undertake missions to enable Governments to interact with indigenous communities.  Their mandate was to receive complaints of human rights violations  and these efforts had begun to yield fruit. There were now policies and good practices in several countries  she said  adding that the Commission had cultural initiatives covering indigenous peoples throughout Africa.  Niger  for example  had recognized the rights of pastoral communities.  The Commission also referred to past injustices  she said  noting the importance of the Conference.  The assembled delegates  she said  were now the ones called upon to make the Outcome Document a living document  to show how the United Nations could be used to identify the requisite resources  to enable indigenous peoples to enjoy the fruits of their own labour. In the discussion that followed  the representative of the Indigenous Caucus of the Arctic highlighted a prophecy in her country  which said that a spider’s web would eventually cover the Earth.  “Think of the Internet today ” she explained.  Using the situation of her own group  she said that Inuit rights were being recognized in Canada  but that aboriginal treaty signatories were often left with no choice but to turn to the courts.  Indigenous peoples in Canada tried to get the Government to implement a modern treaty  which met their goals.  Self-determination  she said  was a process of incremental change. The representative of Denmark said his country had advanced indigenous rights and a long-term strategy for the Arctic.  He then ceded the speaker’s seat to the representative of Greenland  who listed important ways in which Greenland exercised its self-determination.  Her country  however  still had serious social problems  including erosion of traditional values  she added. The representative of the Caucus of Latin America and the Caribbean  noting that States still had reservations with respect to interpretation of laws and reforms  said legislation should apply uniformly to all inhabitants of a country and not favour one sector only.  Further  she proposed that legal systems of indigenous people be recognized by Member States. New Zealand’s representative said his country had developed its own unique approaches to support Maori to achieve their full potential.  Central to its approach and relationship with Maori was respect for indigenous peoples’ rights  underpinned by the principle of partnership.  The Waitangi Tribunal was a mechanism for inquiry into historical grievances  as well as contemporary issues relating to the Crown’s treaty relationship with iwi and Maori communities.  Significant progress had been made and completion of treaty settlements was more than halfway through  which typically included a Crown apology for historical wrongs and restitution of traditionally held lands and resources  thereby strengthening the partnerships between iwi and the Government. The representative of the Cordillera Peoples Alliance said that in his nation  collective rights to ancestral lands  territories and resources continued to be violated as State military forces were deployed in their communities to protect “destructive projects and corporate plunder”.  He called for a resumption of peace talks between the Philippine Government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines to “address the root causes of the armed conflict towards a just and lasting peace”. Guyana’s representative said that her country was firmly committed to the advancement of indigenous peoples.  Guyana was among the few countries to have enacted legislation to safeguard the rights of indigenous peoples  including land rights.  Indigenous leaders held leadership positions at national and local levels of Government in her country  she said  adding that those achievements could only have been accomplished through a strong partnership with indigenous peoples. Also participating in the discussion were representatives of Ecuador  South Africa  Nigeria  Ukraine  Venezuela  Brazil  Australia  Malaysia  Chile  Namibia  Suriname  Indonesia and the Inter-Parliamentary Union  as well as representatives of major civil society organizations Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

Sixty-ninth General Assembly Second Committee 1st Meeting (PM) The Second Committee (Economic and Financial) of the United Nations General Assembly approved its organization of work for the sixty-ninth session this afternoon  also welcoming new bureau members and hearing proposals on working methods. Committee Chair Sebastiano Cardi (Italy) drew members’ attention to the Organization of Work (document A/C.2/69/L.1)  reminding delegates of General Assembly decisions on working methods and stressing that the packed agenda meant they would need to stick to deadlines in submissions of proposals and negotiations.  The Committee adopted the Organization of Work and a note by the secretariat on the status of documentation for the session (document A/C.2/69/L.1/Add.1) by consensus. Thanking the outgoing Committee bureau  Mr. Cardi welcomed its new members:  Vice-Chairpersons Tishka Francis ( Bahamas)  Tarik Izararen ( Morocco) and Alexsandra Stepowka ( Poland) and Rapporteur Borg Tsien Tham ( Singapore).  He then described how their responsibilities would be divided. He outlined his plans to ensure the Committee’s effective and efficient operation  which included a meeting on working methods  a commitment to start all meetings on time  and the production of concise  action-oriented resolutions.  Discipline and full use of time available for informal discussion of agenda items would aid in those efforts. For the first time in the Committee’s history  he said  the keynote speaker in its General Debate would be a woman  Janet Gornick  a Professor of Political Science and Sociology at the City University of New York Graduate Center.  The debate would run from 7 October until 9 October. Mr. Cardi told members that the Committee would hold special events to brainstorm and encourage unconventional thinking on topics.  Special events would focus on e-Government for sustainable development in small island d eveloping States; Investment promotion regime for foreign direct investment in least developed countries; Promoting accountability at all levels:  Monitoring the post-2015 development agenda; and Social market economy and new instruments of social finance.  Two joint meetings would be held with the Economic and Social Council. It was essential to conclude the Committee’s work by 26 November  not least because any draft proposals with financial implications had to be submitted to the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) by 1 December.  He noted that the second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries would be held in Vienna from 3 to 5 November and would affect availability of Committee members for consultations. The Second Committee will meet again on 7 October at 10 a.m. to begin its substantive work. * *** * Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.

2014-09-19,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11552.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Sixty-ninth General Assembly Plenary 3rd Meeting (PM)     Expressing grave concern over the recent deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa  the General Assembly this afternoon signalled its approval for United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s intention to set up an international emergency response mission and called upon all Member States to fully support it. Unanimously adopting a resolution on measures to contain and combat the virus (document A/69/L.2)  as orally revised  the Assembly asked the Secretary-General to take steps to promptly establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response  or UNMEER  and to submit a detailed report on that matter for the Assembly to consider at its current session. In identical letters dated 17 September to the Presidents of the Assembly and the Security Council (document A/69/389-S/2014/679)  the Secretary-General sets forth the Mission’s six guiding principles and 12 actions deemed critical by the Senior United Nations System Coordinator to carry out the Mission’s aims.  Those steps would cost almost $1 billion over the next six months. “We are all aware of the immensity of the suffering in West Africa and the enormity of the challenge ” Mr. Ban said  urging the global community to work in unorthodox ways and break institutional barriers and other hurdles to get the crisis under control.  “The establishment of the UNMEER is just the beginning.  We will need to stay engaged  and we will need to reach new heights of cooperation.  No single State  and no single organization  can do this alone.” The virus had already claimed more than 2 500 lives — most of them women  who formed the bulk of health-care workers and caregivers of the sick  he said.  Citing World Health Organization (WHO) figures  he said there were nearly 5 000 cases of Ebola infection in West Africa  but that given the shortfalls in reporting and monitoring  that number was likely much higher.  “None of us is insulated from the threat of Ebola:  all of us must be part of the response ” he said. What began as a public health emergency had become a crisis with significant economic  social  humanitarian  political and security consequences  he said  threatening to permanently undo recent development and security gains in the three most affected countries — Sierra Leone  Liberia and Guinea — after years of war and atrocity.  WHO had developed a response road map and was working with the affected nations to identify the best possible epidemiological response  including through a mix of Ebola treatment and community care centres  he said.  The new United Nations Mission  to be based in Accra  Ghana  would focus on stopping the outbreak  treating the infected  providing essential services  preserving stability  and preventing outbreaks in non-affected countries.  Echoing those concerns  Sam Kutesa (Uganda)  President of the General Assembly  who introduced the resolution  said the virus was spreading exponentially  with half of all cases having been recorded in just the last three weeks.  It was no longer a subregional or even regional calamity  but an international crisis.  According to WHO  at the current rate of infection  as many as 20 000 people could be infected in the next few months. “The time to act in a swift  coordinated and purposeful manner is now ” he said.  “Without quick and decisive action  the trail of devastation this outbreak leaves behind will reach far beyond the portions of West Africa most affected up to now.”  The outbreak  he warned  could have far-reaching  destabilizing impacts and came at a time when the three most-affected countries were embracing relative peace  security and stability. After the text’s adoption  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Liberia and representatives of Sierra Leone and Guinea took the floor to commend the Secretary-General’s swift action to install an emergency mission on the ground  thank Governments and organizations that had given military  financial  medical  personnel and logistical support  and call on Member States to lift travel bans to the affected countries.  In addition  several representatives cited their respective Government’s steps and financial pledges to help contain the virus. Also speaking today was the Minister for Health of South Africa. Other speakers included the representatives of Malawi (on behalf of the African States)  European Union  United States  Argentina  Kenya  India  Mozambique  Ecuador  Venezuela  United Kingdom  Mexico  Brazil  Japan  Canada  El Salvador  China  Cuba  Indonesia  Australia  Uganda  France  Sweden  United Republic of Tanzania and Ghana. Statements after Adoption AUGUSTINE KPEHE NGAFUAN  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Liberia  called on all Member States to take critical actions to implement the text.  The disease’s rapid spread had confounded Governments in the region and their partners at a time when those nations were experiencing peace after years of conflict.  Liberia’s health system was not prepared to take on an epidemic of such magnitude.  Nearly 80 per cent of those infected with the virus succumbed to it.  The fear created by the outbreak was undermining Liberia’s overall health care system and its ability to respond to other pressing medical concerns including malaria  diarrhoea  typhoid fever and pregnancy-related complications.  Many Government functions had been suspended to deal with the emergency.  The Government  World Health Organization (WHO)  Médecins San Frontières and the United States Centre for Disease Control had taken measures that were unsuccessful in controlling the virus’ transmission. Restricting travel to and from the most affected countries and banning flights would only aggravate the outbreak and undermine efforts to contain it  he said.  He praised nations that were now opening their borders to fight the disease and encouraged others to follow suit.  The United States announced a level of support to the region that would have monumental impact.  Yesterday’s Security Council meeting gave an impressive number of Member States the chance to indicate their support.  That ensured that the people in Liberia and the diaspora were not alone.  He commended the Secretary-General’s prudent  swift action.  A new mission would ensure strong United Nations leadership  effective coordination and swift delivery of supplies and services.  He commended all international partners for working to bring the disease to an early end. AARON MOTSOALEDI  Minister for Health of South Africa  said the virus had painfully highlighted how a public health issue could hinder a country’s economy and showed the urgent need to enforce measures to contain it.  The outbreak continued to escalate and expand geographically.  Laboratory capacity to address it was gradually expanding but there were critical needs in several locations.  In response  South Africa had provided a mobile laboratory in Sierra Leone; it would provide further support for Liberia  and planned to set up a 40-bed field hospital there  staffed by 75 health professionals.  Recruitment of those professionals was under way.  It would also provide four ambulances  four generators and 70 vehicles. South Africa had called on many partners in the private sector to provide aid  he said.  His Government received pledges of support  from companies listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange  in the form of logistics  air travel  ambulances and medical supplies.  On 26 September  the Southern African Development Community (SADC) would begin training 16 countries to help strengthen surveillance.  South African hospitals would also enhance clinical management of infected patients; 11 hospitals in the country were on standby in case of an Ebola outbreak.   CHARLES P. MSOSA (Malawi)  speaking on behalf of the African States  welcomed the resolution adopted in the Assembly.  The outbreak was unprecedented and people  including traders and farmers  lived in fear now.  The crisis was giving a hard time to post-conflict countries.  The African Union had commenced initiatives to tackle the problem  including a decision taken on 19 August by its Peace and Security Council.  It was important to listen to voices on the ground  and vital to harmonize all strategic efforts in Africa. NAFSIKA NANCY EVA VRAILA of the European Union Delegation said the outbreak of Ebola was no longer a regional problem.  The bloc welcomed the Secretary-General’s plan to establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response.  All relevant parts of the United Nations system should be activated to support that organ.  The Union would continue assisting the most affected areas through the United Nations  regional organizations and non-governmental organizations.  It had pledged 150 million euros.  In addition  it had contributed 5 million euros to the African Union. VANDI CHIDI MINAH (Sierra Leone) paid tribute to the medical staff that had given their lives to the virus and said the Ebola outbreak was now a global health emergency.  With the help of the global community  he was confident the necessary supplies would make their way to the region and expressed confidence that the United Nations mission would be set up as soon as possible and that the affected countries would regain their development momentum.  The World Bank had already recorded a drop in their development level.  As the epidemic had a disproportionate impact on women  the response must be gender-sensitive.  The road ahead would be difficult.  Everyone had a role to play.  “A culture of fear should not be allowed to let this epidemic metastasize into something greater ” he said.  Various supplies were en route to Sierra Leone and various non-governmental organizations had advocated support for efforts to address the virus. MAMADI TOURÉ (Guinea) said the unprecedented crisis  in full swing in his country and neighbouring Liberia and Sierra  required urgent steps to save lives.  The epidemic had already claimed more than 2 400 lives  including caregivers in Guinea  where the outbreak began in March.  It had gravely impacted the region’s economies  slowing trade  economic activity  investment and tourism.  The World Bank had warned that if the outbreak did not subside  its economic impact would be catastrophic.  Already it had significantly increased prices for basic food items.  It was imperative to end the crisis  and international intervention was vital and must be well coordinated.  Guinea’s people and Government were committed to cooperating closely with the United Nations mission to ensure its success.  He thanked WHO  Médecins Sans Frontières  the United States Center for Disease Control  and nations such as Morocco and Malawi for their support  solidarity and friendship. ELIZABETH COUSENS of the United States strongly supported the Secretary-General’s plan to establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response.  On 18 September  about 130 countries had come together to co-sponsor a Security Council resolution to scale up the global response to the Ebola outbreak.  Today  the Assembly had come together to support the Secretary-General’s plan.  Her Government would use its specialized capabilities in support of those efforts and urged other Governments and stakeholders to join.  It was not the commitment made that was important  but rather the commitment delivered. MARÍA CRISTINA PERCEVAL (Argentina) said she attended today’s meeting because the Assembly was the most representative body  welcoming the consensus adoption of the resolution in support of establishing the crisis-response mission.  The Secretary-General had said the outbreak was not a health problem  but rather a multidimensional threat with humanitarian  social and economic impact.  The affected countries did not deserve that as they charted a path to development.  The crisis also revealed ongoing concerns about poverty and inequality. MACHARIA KAMAU (Kenya) said the Ebola crisis posed among the worst threats in the world today.  No one was safe from its reach.  The lessons of the HIV/AIDS epidemic must not be forgotten.  The crisis must be recognized and defined as a threat to international peace and security  and as a global humanitarian catastrophe.  The response must commensurate to the challenge  technically thorough and in solidarity with affected countries to free them from isolation.  Kenya had put in place a national preparedness programme at home  and donated $1 million total to the three affected countries.  It would share its expertise on Ebola management  diagnostic capabilities and health-care workers with those nations.  The Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs had announced the Government was working to review the ban on flights to affected countries.   ASOKE KUMAR MUKERJI (India) expressed grave concern over the virus.  His Government had provided medicines and financial aid to its counterparts in Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone  and had contributed funds to WHO to address the virus.  India had troops available in the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL).  As 45 000 Indian nations lived in West Africa  India stood in solidarity with the people in that region. ANTÓNIO GUMENDE (Mozambique) commended those countries that had already pledged provision of resources to assist the most affected countries  as well as their neighbours  including the announced deployment of personnel under the African Union Support to Ebola Outbreak mission. XAVIER LASSO MENDOZA (Ecuador) expressed solidarity with West African countries  especially Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea.  His Government consulted with officials from those countries to identify their people’s needs.  He underscored the general support extended by Cuba despite the illegal blockade it faced. SAMUEL MONCADA (Venezuela)  expressing concern over the epidemic  said that action was needed to contain it  with a gender-specific focus as most of the victims were women.  In Quito  from 8 to 9 September  the first meeting of the Special Committee of the South American-African Cooperation Forum expressed grave concern over the epidemic’s consequences  and decided that the Union of South American Nations should hold a meeting as soon as possible to find ways to support the region.  His Government was looking at ways to urgently do that. MARTIN SHEARMAN (United Kingdom)  associating himself with the European Union Delegation  said the international community must work to combat the virus and prevent its spread.  He welcomed adoption of the Council resolution and the Secretary-General’s intention to create a special mission towards that end.  His Government would provide a $60 million health-care centre in the affected region  military experts and staff from Save the Children United Kingdom.  On 17 September  it had announced a significant increase in its package of support  with a total of 700 treatment beds for Sierra Leone.  It would deliver another 500 treatment beds and staff to operate them.  It was partnering with WHO  Médecins Sans Frontières  UNICEF and other aid actors. The representative of Mexico said his delegation felt that the convening of today’s meeting was timely as it followed yesterday’s adoption of the Security Council resolution to scale up global response to the Ebola outbreak.  The response must be borderless.  Today’s adoption of the Assembly resolution that backed the establishment of the crisis-response mission was a clear testimony of international cooperation.  ANTONIO DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil) said the Peacebuilding Commission would serve as a common platform in New York for discussion  information-sharing and awareness-raising.  His Government would have liked recognition of the Commission’s early warning function in today’s resolution. The representative of Japan supported the Assembly resolution and expected the United Nations to combat the virus as one unified body.  So far  his Government had committed $5 million for West Africa  and had dispatched Japanese doctors and medical suits for health-care workers to the region.  It stood ready to provide a new medication against Ebola developed by two Japanese pharmaceutical companies.  In the long-term  it would continue to support affected countries’ national efforts to combat the disease. MICHAEL DOUGLAS GRANT (Canada) expressed deep concern over the crisis.  Canada made early contributions to the emergency response  deploying experts  vaccines and material and financial support to the region.  It had contributed to WHO  Médecins Sans Frontières and local offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)  and deployed a mobile laboratory to Sierra Leone with rotating teams of laboratory technicians  as well as four delegates of the Canadian Red Cross and four of Canada’s UNICEF office.  It had provided more than $2.5 million in medical equipment to WHO and nearly 1 000 doses of an experimental vaccine in addition to actively contributing to expert panels on Ebola. RUBÉN IGNACIO ZAMORA RIVAS El Salvador said that the Ebola outbreak required prompt efficient and joint efforts.  It supported the Secretary-General’s proposal to establish the crisis-response Mission  which would work hand in hand with WHO and other programmes and agencies of the United Nations.  In his country  more than 80 doctors and medical personnel had signed up for rendering services in West Africa. WANG HAO China said that “time means life”.  With the passage of time  it would become harder to put the disease under control.  China experienced the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome disease in 2003 and understood the suffering of the people of West Africa.  His country had 174 medical experts in the most affected countries.  Yesterday  it decided to provide 200 million yuan in additional aid for West African nations and to give $2 million each to WHO and the African Union. RODOLFO REYES RODRÍGUEZ (Cuba) expressed solidarity with the affected countries and support for the Secretary-General’s proposed emergency response mission.  “We can pull this off.  The people — the women  the children of West Africa — deserve this response ” he said.  Every member of Cuba’s specialized medical response team had more than 15 years experience addressing medical epidemics.  Cuba would work with all countries  including those with which it did not have diplomatic relations  to help combat the disease.  Cuba’s more than 4 000 health workers stood ready. MASNI ERIZA (Indonesia) said a coordinated international response to combat Ebola’s spread was vital.  He fully supported the Secretary-General’s initiative and expressed hope that the crisis could be contained soon. PHILIPPA JANE KING (Australia) said action was urgent as there was much catching up to do to reverse the epidemic’s spread.  A coordinated  comprehensive response was vital.  She strongly supported the Secretary-General’s proposed mission  and stood in solidarity with the affected countries.  Australia’s Foreign Minister recently announced that his Government would give another $7 million  including for the WHO coordinated regional response.  Australia would continue to assess areas where it could best contribute. RICHARD NDUHUURA (Uganda) said that as soon as the first cases of Ebola were identified  public health officials in his country had created makeshift quarantines and called a press conference together with WHO.  It exposed the problem right away and de-mystified any stigma attached to it.  Uganda sent 20 top Ebola experts to Sierra Leone and Liberia in July. FRANCOIS XAVIER DENIAU (France) said the health crisis  due to its scale  had turned into a social and economic problem  becoming a threat to peace and security.  He underscored the importance of “act  coordinate and prevent”.  France had made financial contributions and on 18 September its President announced the establishment of a military hospital in Guinea.  He also described how the European Union was coordinating efforts while stressing the importance of preventive measures.   CARL ORRENIUS SKAU (Sweden) welcomed the Secretary-General’s initiative to soon convene a high-level meeting on the matter and today’s Assembly decision to set up an emergency response mission.  Sweden had long-standing international relations with the affected countries and had contributed $4.4 million to the response to combat the virus.  It was in the final stages of devising an additional aid package of $13 million.  As Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission’s country configuration for Liberia  Sweden would continue contributing to that country’s long-term peacebuilding priorities and those of the region.   The representative of the United Republic of Tanzania regretted travel and flight bans to the affected countries.  It was vital to foster the socioeconomic development of the affected countries and the region as a whole to enable it to better prevent and address the health-care crisis.  He supported the Secretary-General’s initiative. GEORGE WILFRED TALBOT (Guyana) supported the Secretary-General’s initiative and a massive scaling up of emergency aid to help control the crisis.  Guyana was giving active consideration to an appropriate contribution in the context of the global response.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-09-16,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11549.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Sixty-ninth General Assembly Plenary 1st Meeting (PM)     Calling for Action  Secretary-General Anticipates ‘Most Consequential’ Session in Generation as He Urges Attention to Rising Tide of Intolerance Despite an unprecedented array of such weighty challenges as poverty  armed conflicts and climate change  the international community could achieve great things with dedication and single-mindedness of purpose and compromise  said the new President of the General Assembly this afternoon as he opened its sixty-ninth session. “The coming year will be a momentous time for the United Nations ” said Sam Kutesa (Uganda)  as it would mark the seventieth anniversary of its founding and 15 years since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration  among other milestones.  The current session would be “very busy”  with Member States preoccupied with intergovernmental negotiations on a post-2015 development agenda.  In addition  preparations and negotiations were under way towards an outcome for the third Conference on Financing for Development in July 2015 in Addis Ababa  and an agreement on climate change under the United Nations Framework Convention.  Noting the theme of the general debate  “Delivering on and Implementing a Transformative Post-2015 Development Agenda”  he stressed the need to ensure that the new development agenda was truly transformative  with the eradication of poverty and hunger and the promotion of sustained and inclusive economic growth as its overarching objectives.  To that end  he would convene three high-level thematic debates and one high-level event  although those debates would not preempt or prejudge the outcome of the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations. The first such debate  slated for February 2015  would be on the means of implementation for the post-2015 development agenda.  The second one  to be held in March  would focus on advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women in the post-2015 development agenda.  The third would be held in April or May and address the peaceful settlement of disputes and strengthening cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations. A high-level event on combating climate change would be held in June to give momentum and added impetus to efforts to reaching a global agreement  he said.  His presidency would also seek to revitalize the General Assembly and reform the Security Council. “To say we are living in tumultuous times would seem an understatement ” he said  citing such daunting challenges as poverty and hunger; persistent unemployment; violent armed conflicts; faltering education systems; climate change and rising sea-levels; inadequate infrastructure; dire health threats like Ebola; and a rise in polarization  extremism and terrorist activities.  Those formidable challenges must be tackled with a sense of resolve and resilience over the next 12 months  he urged. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the Assembly would focus on stemming the existential threat of climate change  advancing the rights and opportunities of the world’s indigenous people  improving the health of women and girls  tackling the deadly Ebola virus  and addressing today’s many peace and security challenges.  He urged the international community to work together to accelerate progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals  establish a set of sustainable development goals and an agenda to erase extreme poverty in the next 15 years  as well as to create a greener  cleaner planet  make human rights a top priority  and promote peace and security worldwide for everyone. “The coming year must be a time for action.  A time for results ” he said  stressing that the session could be the “most consequential” in and for a generation.  The Assembly’s eyes also must be open to the rising tide of intolerance and serve as the ultimate rebuke to that distorted  venomous view of the world.  In an interconnected world  the best way to solve problems was by working together in a more determined way than ever before.  “By being here  you have shown your commitment to that twenty-first century truth and command.  Now let us prove it through principled and effective action ” he said. In other business today  the Assembly took note of a letter from the Secretary-General (document A/69/374) informing the Assembly President that five Member States were behind in payments of financial contributions to the Organization under the Charter’s Article 19  which says that a Member State in arrears will have no vote in the Assembly if the amount of those arrears exceeds the amount of the contributions due from the preceding two years. The Assembly also decided that its Credentials Committee for the sixty-ninth session would comprise Brazil  China  Bangladesh  Denmark  Jamaica  Namibia  Senegal  Russian Federation and the United States.    Assembly members then authorized 11 of its subsidiary organs to meet at Headquarters during the session  as follows:  the Preparatory Committee for the Third United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Development (Habitat III); Intergovernmental Preparatory Committee for the 10-year Review Conference on the Implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action; Panel of External Auditors of the United Nations  the Specialized Agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); Board of Auditors; Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; Disarmament Commission; Independent Audit Advisory Committee; Executive Board of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women); Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People; Working Group on the Financing of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA); and the Committee on Relations with the Host Country.   The General Assembly will meet again at a date and time to be announced.

2014-09-15,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11546.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Sixty-eighth General Assembly Plenary 109th Meeting (PM)   Resolution Adopted on Clean Technologies  Decisions Taken on Draft Agenda for Next Session The General Assembly’s sixty-eighth session came to a close today  with the outgoing President noting that there had been some great successes in the past session  despite the challenging circumstances. John Ashe  President of the sixty-eighth session  said today was a far cry from the day in June 2013  when he had assumed the podium in the temporary General Assembly Hall.  “I am here to tell you that there was nothing temporary or makeshift about the memorable outcomes that we have as a collective whole achieved this session ” he said.  During his term  he said  the General Assembly had adopted more than 300 resolutions and 80 decisions on a wide range of issues  including nuclear disarmament  rule of law at national and international levels  financing for development  the peaceful use of outer space  the right to privacy  the safety of journalists and peacekeeping budgets.  Moving forward  delegates would have to pay particular attention to the most vulnerable in society  especially women and children.  Women could no longer be relegated to the status of second-class citizens  while youth should be brought into the planning stages as an integral part of the Assembly’s work. There was a long list of other accomplishments  he said  noting  among others  the fourth Biennial Review of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  the High-level Declaration on migration and development  a renewed commitment to the fight against non-communicable diseases  a resolution on enhancing the functioning of the human rights treaty body system  the establishment of the Nelson Mandela Prize and the unveiling of the winning design for a memorial in remembrance of the victims of slavery and transatlantic slave trade. One of his objectives had been to make progress on revitalizing and reforming the General Assembly  he said  voicing satisfaction at the progress made towards making the Organization more relevant  more responsive and more effective.  Much work remained to be done  however  particularly in the area of Security Council reform  he said  adding that the international community must not “shy away” from that endeavour.  He hoped the membership would build on the modest momentum that had been achieved in that area during the session. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon paid tribute to the outgoing President  recalling that it had been an eventful year with a full agenda  including on the Millennium Development Goals  the post-2015 development agenda and the need for a meaningful new climate change agreement.  Throughout the session  he said  the world had faced many global challenges that left the Security Council paralysed  and on which  the General Assembly had risen to act.  Speaking directly to the President  he said  “through it all  you demonstrated wise leadership in steering our global discussion toward constructive solutions”. Mr. Ban noted that Mr. Ashe had come from a small island with a “big capacity to work with other countries” and that he had used his training as an engineer to build consensus.  Mr. Ashe’s leadership as Co-chair of the Rio+20 Conference had paved a foundation for future deliberations on sustainable development goals.  The Assembly session had truly set the stage for a successful post-2015 development agenda through a number of important thematic debates and valuable high-level events.  He applauded Mr. Ashe’s efforts  saying they would have a positive effect on the world’s collective long-term future  including his initiatives to revitalize the Assembly. Action Acting without a vote  the Assembly adopted the draft resolution  titled “Four one-day structured dialogues on possible arrangements for a facilitation mechanism to promote the development  transfer and dissemination of clean and environmentally sound technologies” (document A/68/L.62). Speaking after the adoption  the representative of the European Union Delegation believed that the further elaboration of the areas covered in the structured dialogues must be at the core of future technology discussions.  His delegation remained open to considering new ideas and proposals  but felt that additional time should not be devoted to discussing areas where no consensus was emerging. The representative of Japan said her country remained keen to share its knowledge and technology with the international community.  Without technology  it would be impossible to achieve any development in any country.  The primary outcome from the structured dialogues was the realization of the importance to create an environment that was conducive to engaging the private sector  which were the primary owner and developer of technology. The representative of India said that  with the resolution’s passage  the Assembly had provided a mandate for continued discussions  while also linking them with the post-2015 development agenda.  The resolution mandated the continuation of discussions based on recommendations of the General Assembly President  taking into account the outcomes of the four structured dialogues. The representative of Indonesia was pleased with the outcome document from the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development  which recognized the important role of technology for development.  Developing countries  in particular  faced major challenges  and the structured dialogues had provided a comprehensive picture of the importance of technology in development  he said  calling for more discussions on the topic. The representative of the United States said the resolution reconfirmed the importance of technology to development solutions and generated ideas for next steps.  However  there was still significant work to be done and it was critical to understand the issue more broadly.  There must be a more substantial  analytical exercise and a better understanding of the private sector’s position. The representative of Australia said her delegation believed intellectual property rules were not a barrier or constraint to technology development or transfer  but rather helped to encourage investment and innovation. Moving on to a series of outstanding matters  the Assembly took note of “The Report of the Security Council” (document A/68/2) and decided to include a number of items in the draft agenda of the coming session. Among them were Question of the Comorian island of Mayotte  Question of Cyprus; Armed aggression against the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas); the situation of democracy and human rights in Haiti; Armed Israeli aggression against the Iraqi nuclear installations and its grave consequences for the established international system concerning the peaceful uses of nuclear energy  the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and international peace and security; and Consequences of the Iraqi occupation of and aggression against Kuwait. It also decided that the next session should consider  among others  the Addendum to the report of the Secretary-General on Strengthening and Coordinating United Nations rule of law activities (document A/68/213/Addendum 1)  as well as the draft agenda an item titled “the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991”. The following items  the Assembly decided  would not be included in the draft agenda:  Strengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes  conflict prevention and resolution; Strengthening of international cooperation and coordination of efforts to study  mitigate and minimize the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster; Programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013; and Proposed programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015. The body deferred to the next session consideration of the following items:  International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994; the situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan; Financing of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad; Financing of the United Nations Mission in East Timor; Investigation into the conditions and circumstances resulting in the tragic death of Dag Hammarskjöld and of the members of the party accompanying him; and Human Rights Council Resolution 24/24. Mr. Ashe forwarded to the incoming Assembly President for consideration and action at the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples the draft resolution  entitled “Outcome document of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples”.  He also forwarded the current version of the draft resolution on “the Organization of the United Nations Summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda”. On a point of order  the representatives of the United States and the European Union said it was understood that the agenda item regarding “Human Rights Council Resolution 24/24” had been closed.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

Sixty-eighth General Assembly Plenary 108th Meeting (PM) Delegates A lso Pass Measures Addressing Malaria  Revitalizing Work of Assembly The General Assembly adopted three resolutions today  including one that would pave the way for the incorporation of sustainable development goals into the post-2015 development agenda. In adopting the “Report of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 66/288” (document A/68/L.61)  as orally amended  the Assembly decided that the outcome document from the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals would be the main basis for integrating the sustainable development goals into the future development agenda.  The resolution went on to state that other inputs would also be considered during the intergovernmental negotiation process at the upcoming General Assembly session. Speaking in explanation of position  the representative of Bolivia  speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  said the Group attached a high degree of importance to the outcome document of the Open Working Group  which contained constructive guidance for the sustainable development goals.  He noted that all reservations on the text must be compiled into and clearly referenced in an official document. Libya’s representative  speaking on behalf of the Arab Group  said the Group had “valid and well-founded” concerns about Goal 16 of the proposed sustainable development goals.  The Group requested that the goal include targets on ending all forms of colonial domination and foreign occupation; strengthening adherence to international law by all stakeholders; and intensifying international cooperation on countering terrorism  especially by addressing its root causes.  He reiterated his request that the Arab Group’s positions be reflected in the Working Group’s report. The representative of Malawi  speaking on behalf of the African Group and associating himself with the Group of 77 and China  said that today’s adoption signified the beginning of an important journey that would take the international community through the next phase of development negotiations. The representative of the European Union Delegation noted that considerable progress had been made over the last 18 months and said the discussions that had taken place within the Open Working Group would inform the intergovernmental negotiation process during the upcoming General Assembly session. Benin’s representative  speaking on behalf of the Group of Least Developed Countries  said a multilateral approach was the only way to tackle the world’s problems.  He stressed the need to take into account the relevant reservations that had been expressed  without challenging the substance of the document. In another act  the Assembly adopted the “Report of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the Work of the General Assembly” (document A/68/951*) and the resolution contained there within.  Through the resolution’s adoption  Assembly members decided to establish an ad hoc working group on the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly to identify ways to enhance the role  authority  effectiveness and efficiency of the Assembly by building on progress already achieved. Speaking after the adoption  the European Union Delegation’s representative pointed to “concrete results” within the resolution adopted  including the earlier election of non-permanent Security Council and Economic and Social Council members.  He added that the agendas of the General Assembly and Economic and Social Council needed to be rationalized to eliminate duplication and overlap  as well as boost complementarity when considering and negotiating similar and related issues. The representative of Liechtenstein welcomed a resolution reconfirming the President of the General Assembly’s role in supporting the election process for the Secretary-General by identifying potential candidates in consultation with Member States.  That had not yet happened  but hopefully  future Presidents would fulfil the mandate.  He said he hoped to start a debate in the General Assembly on criteria for possible candidates and regretted that the adopted text did not that. The representative of Algeria  speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  said the process of revitalizing the work of the General Assembly did not stop with the passage of the resolution  but rather  was an ongoing effort. In a final act  the Assembly adopted ”Consolidating gains and accelerating efforts to control and eliminate malaria in developing countries  particularly in Africa  by 2015” (document A/68/L.60)  thereby calling for increased support for the implementation of international commitments and goals pertaining to the fight to eliminate malaria. The resolution urged malaria-endemic countries to work towards financial sustainability to increase national resources allocated to controlling that disease  while also working with the private sector to improve access to quality medical services.  Further  the resolution called upon Member States to establish or strengthen national policies  operational plans and research  with a view to achieving internationally agreed malaria targets for 2015. Ethiopia’s representative  speaking on behalf of the African Group  called the resolution “critical” as it would serve as a rallying call for countries and provided tangible guideposts for development partners. Also speaking today were representatives of Belarus  Thailand  Slovakia  Guatemala  Iran  United States  Japan  India  Brazil  Nigeria  Palau  Ecuador and Australia. The General Assembly will reconvene on Thursday  11 September  for a high-level stock-taking event on the Post-2015 Development Agenda.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-09-09,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11542.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Sixty-eighth General Assembly Plenary 107th Meeting (PM)   Texts on International Decade for People of African Descent  International Criminal Court  United Nations Administration Also Passed The General Assembly adopted four resolutions today  including one on sovereign debt restructuring that would establish an intergovernmental negotiation process aimed at increasing the efficiency  stability and predictability of the international financial system. With 124 votes in favour  11 votes against and 41 abstentions  the Assembly adopted “Towards the establishment of a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes” (document A/68/L.57/Rev.1). Introducing the draft resolution  Sacha Sergio Llorentty Solíz (Bolivia)  speaking for the “Group of 77” developing countries and China  said the text stressed the importance of timely  effective  understandable and lasting debt restructuring solutions for developing countries that would promote growth in an inclusive manner. However  Terri Robl ( United States)  speaking in explanation of vote  stressed that she could not support a statutory mechanism for sovereign debt restructuring as such a mechanism was likely to create economic uncertainty.  That uncertainty could impact upon the provision of financing to developing countries.  In the past  market-oriented approaches had been preferred and work was ongoing in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and elsewhere.  Furthermore  not only had the resolution presupposed a final outcome  which inhibited proper discussion  it had been snuck onto the docket at the very end of the session  establishing a costly mandate and asking Member States “to write a blank cheque”. Hector Timerman  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Argentina  expressing pride that so many countries supported the resolution  stated that as a “democratic forum par excellence”  the General Assembly was the right place for discussions aiming at embarking on an ethical political and legal pathway to end unbridled speculation.  The clear majority agreed it was time to establish a legal framework for restructuring that respected creditors while allowing debtors to emerge from debt safely.  The profits currently made by vulture funds were scandalous and were funnelled into campaigning and lobbying to prevent changes to the situation. Addressing those who had not voted in favour of the resolution  he noted that those delegates generally represented centres of finance.  Yet  a legal restructuring framework would benefit developed  as well as developing  countries.  Sovereign debt held development back and the establishment of a better system could improve global economic security.  The Assembly’s democratic decision to support the creation of a mechanism would give the peoples of the world what they deserved  saving them from the “sinister masters of opulence” who ran vulture funds. Rodolfo Reyes Rodríguez ( Cuba) pointed out that vulture funds did not deserve the name “vulture”.  Vultures contributed positively to ecosystems; vulture funds were parasitic.  Developing countries had paid many times the amounts originally received as loans and that ate resources essential to development.  He wondered how much progress on the Millennium Development Goals had been missed through such denial of resources. Shorna-Kay Marie Richards (Jamaica)  noting how recent events brought urgency to addressing sovereign debt and establishing a multilateral mechanism for restructuring  said that the United Nations dealt with States’ sustainable development objectives.  Therefore  the General Assembly was an appropriate forum in which to consider those issues.  The private market could not fully address problems of unsustainable sovereign debt.  That had been particularly apparent in speculation by specialized investment funds that purchased distressed and deeply discounted sovereign debt on secondary markets for the sole purpose of recouping full value through litigation. The Assembly then took up the draft resolution  “Programme of activities for the implementation of the International Decade for People of African Descent (document A/68/L.58)  which it adopted without a vote. Karel Jan Gustaaf van Oosterom (Netherlands)  introducing the draft resolution “Report of the International Criminal Court” (document A/68/L.59)  said that the document provided political support for the International Criminal Court and the work it carried out  while underlining the important relationship between the Court and the United Nations.  The text also served to remind the world of the need to cooperate with the Court to ensure its effective functioning. Speaking before the action  Almustafa Mubarak Hussein Rahamtalla ( Sudan) said the International Criminal Court targeted African States.  His country was not party to the Rome Statute and  therefore  was not bound by its decisions  particularly given that Sudan’s national justice system was ready and able to deal with any legal issues. Christian Wenaweser ( Liechtenstein) voiced regret that the text demonstrated a lack of progress since the previous year and looked forward to a higher quality  more relevant document in the future.  He underscored that the text was the only one dealing with the relationship between the United Nations and the International Criminal Court.  States parties to the Rome Statute had offered ideas for improving the draft  but few were included.  He called on the Security Council to use its power to refer States not party to the Rome Statute to the Court and said the recent Council visit to the Court should be followed up by practical measures. Thembile Elphus Joyini ( South Africa) said  as a State party to the Rome Statute  his country was well aware of the tremendous costs of investigations and persecutions of cases referred to the Court by the Security Council.  Such costs should be borne by the United Nations.  He went on to express disappointment that the resolution did not include a paragraph on financing. Koki Muli Grignon ( Kenya) said her country believed that the current implementation and interpretation of the Rome Statute was counterproductive and antagonistic.  The Rome Statute was undergoing a test of veracity  usefulness and impartiality and she urged the international community to take prompt and decisive action to ensure that the “ Kenya cases” do not drag on ad infinitum. The Assembly then took up the draft resolution titled “Enhancement of the administration and financial functioning of the United Nations (document A/68/L.42/Rev.1)  adopting it without a vote. Also speaking were representatives of Iceland  Russian Federation  Japan  Italy (on behalf of the European Union)  Nicaragua  China  Morocco  South Africa  Brazil  Ecuador  El Salvador  India  Singapore  Syria  Colombia  Mexico  Sri Lanka  Egypt  Canada  Norway  Australia  Uruguay  Chile  Venezuela  Algeria  Costa Rica and Hungary. The Assembly will reconvene at 3 p.m. on Wednesday  10 September  to consider three draft resolutions and a report of the Ad Hock Working Group on the Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.

2014-09-08,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11540.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Sixty-eighth General Assembly Plenary 106th Meeting (PM)     President Says ‘Fresh Approach’ Needed In a decision that mirrored similar proceedings from last year  the General Assembly decided today that intergovernmental negotiations on the issue of Security Council reform would carry forward to the next Assembly session. Taking up the “Question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and related matters”  Member States decided the issue would be moved forward to the Assembly’s sixty-ninth session.  An open-ended working group on the matter would also be convened. John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda)  President of the General Assembly  said a “fresh approach” was needed  recalling that upon his election he had hoped to advance the reform agenda.  With that in mind  he had undertaken negotiations with Member States with no illusions concerning the magnitude and complexity of the task.  It would be “foolhardy” to underestimate the challenges that existed; however  Security Council reform was an issue that Member States must not “shy away from”. In regards to one of the outcomes from the intergovernmental negotiations  the so-called “non-paper” which contained a set of ideas pertaining to the reform negotiations  Mr. Ashe noted that although views on the text were clearly mixed  he was thankful for the positive support it had received from Member States and would communicate its findings to his successor for the sixty-ninth session. The representative of Brazil said that although the roll-over decision was a mere repetition of events last year  the President’s term would be remembered as a time when the issue of Security Council reform had been advanced  particularly when considering the contributions of the non-paper.  However  he warned  without meaningful reform  there was risk of the Organization being discredited. Pakistan’s representative said the Assembly had taken a prudent and wise decision.  The reform process must be pursued in good faith in an open  inclusive and transparent manner that would result in a solution garnering the widest possible political consensus from Member States.  Divisiveness would not be helpful for future efforts  he cautioned. The representative of China agreed  saying that postponing a decision on potential reforms was a practical move and that efforts must be made to develop a package solution that took into account the interests and concerns of all parties. However  India’s representative said the draft decision was no different from that adopted a year ago  despite the efforts of Member States.  In fact  no real progress had been made over the last year  including the contents of the non-paper  which  he noted  had been conspicuously left out of the text of the decision. Also speaking were representatives of Japan  Italy  Germany  Colombia  Russian Federation  Solomon Islands and Algeria. The General Assembly will meet again at 3 p.m. on Tuesday  9 September  to consider four draft resolutions.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.

2014-09-04,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/dev3112.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States 7th & 8th Plenary Meetings (AM & PM) ‘ Samoa Pathway’ Document Calls for Building Resilience  Increased Partnerships Renewing commitment to the sustainable development of small island developing States (SIDS)  world leaders today agreed on a landmark action plan at the conclusion of the United Nations Third International Conference on those nations held in Apia  Samoa. Unanimously adopting the wide-ranging outcome document  titled “Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action” — Samoa Pathway — the Heads of State and Government and other high-level representatives also reaffirmed that small island developing States remained “a special case” for sustainable development due to their unique and particular vulnerabilities (document A/CONF.223/3). The text set out new modalities of action on a range of issues  including sustainable  inclusive and equitable economic growth  climate change  sustainable energy  disaster risk reduction  sustainable use of marine resources  and means of implementing those objectives. While stressing that the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was the primary international intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change  world leaders acknowledged the important role of small island developing States in advocating for ambitious global efforts to address climate change and raising awareness of the need for bold and urgent action at the global level. The Samoa Pathway also called for supporting efforts by small island developing States to strengthen resilience to the impacts of climate change and to improve their adaptive capacity through the design and implementation of measures appropriate to their respective vulnerabilities and economic  environmental and social situations.  In particular  developed countries were urged to increase technology  finance and capacity-building support to enable increased mitigation ambition and adaptation actions on the part of developing countries. Also by the text  support was expressed for actions to develop a strategy and targeted measures for SIDS to promote energy efficiency and foster sustainable energy systems based on all energy sources  in particular  renewables such as wind  sustainable biomass  solar  hydroelectric  biofuel and geothermal energy. World leaders also supported efforts to implement the 2005-2015 Hyogo Framework for Action on disaster risk reduction and work for an ambitious renewed international framework beyond that period. They strongly committed to promote and support national  subregional and regional efforts to assess  conserve  protect  manage and sustainably use the oceans  seas and their resources by assisting research and the implementation of strategies on coastal-zone and ecosystem-based management. In line with the Conference theme  “The sustainable development of small island developing States through genuine and durable partnerships ” the text highlighted an urgent need to strengthen international cooperation and ensure such partnerships at the national  regional and international levels. Accordingly  the United Nations Secretary-General was requested to present recommendations for a partnership framework to monitor and ensure the full implementation of pledges and commitments.  Those proposals should be presented to the General Assembly for consideration and action at its sixty‑ninth session. In closing remarks  Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi  Prime Minister of Samoa and President of the Conference  expressed hope that delegates had developed a deeper appreciation and empathy for the realities of small island developing States in a global arena of competing priorities and demands  where those with influence and resources were the winners.  The Conference was not the last of global responses to SIDS’ development challenges  but an important launch pad for ways to use the few resources available to raise living standards in their communities.  The Climate Change Summit to be held on 23 September at United Nations Headquarters in New York would serve as an essential forerunner to the Lima and Paris negotiations for an ambitious climate change treaty in 2015.  Inclusion of SIDS concerns and aims in the Paris treaty were a top priority. Equally important  he said  was the Third Global Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction  to be held in Japan in March 2015.  As the focus shifted from the vulnerabilities of small island developing States to building their resilience  any decisions on the matter must be done in consultation with those States.  The concerns of SIDS must also be included in the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda.  He expressed hope that the Samoa Pathway outcome document would be a blueprint for immediate action  not just a reference point until the next SIDS conference.  “The time for speeches is over.  We must now set sail with determination that the course of action we have chartered here will be delivered to achieve our priorities ” he said. Wu Hongbo  Secretary-General of the Conference and United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs  also delivered closing remarks  stressing that the outcome document represented the international community’s renewed political commitment to the sustainable development of small island developing States. Prior to the text’s adoption  the Conference heard 33 speakers in the general debate  and after its adoption  the representative of the United States said he would issue a full written statement in explanation of his country’s position.  Delegates also adopted the report of the Conference  as well as the resolution titled “Expression of thanks to the people and Government of Samoa” (documents A/CONF.223/L.2  A/CONF.223/L.3 and A/CONF.223/CRP.1). Freundel Stuart  Prime Minister of Barbados; Federico Ramos de Armas  Secretary of State for Environment of Spain; Dennis Francis  Director  Directorate for Multilateral Relations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Trinidad and Tobago; Simona-Mirela Miculescu (Romania); Milan Meetarbhan (Mauritius); and Ronald Jean Jumeau (Seychelles) reported on the discussions in the thematic multi-stakeholder partnership dialogues held in parallel to the plenary meetings. Speaking in the general debate today was a representative of Libya  as well as representatives of the following: the Pacific Islands Forum  Global Environment Facility  Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency  Secretariat of the Pacific Community  Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme  International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)  South Centre  Indian Ocean Commission  International Organization of la Francophonie  World Bank Group  United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women)  United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR)  United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries  Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States  and the Convention on Biological Diversity Secretariat. Also  the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification Secretariat  International Telecommunication Union (ITU)  United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)  United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)  International Monetary Fund (IMF)  Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)  Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)  Asian Development Bank  African  Caribbean and Pacific Group States  International Labour Organization (ILO)  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat  and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Speaking for major groups were representatives of the Caribbean Policy Development Centre (on behalf of the non-governmental organizations major group)  Conseil Régional de la Réunion (on behalf of the local authorities major group)  the Caribbean Farmers' Network (on behalf of the farmers major group) and the Pacific Islands Private Sector Organization (on behalf of the business and industry major group). Summary of Multi-Stakeholder Partnership Dialogue FONOTOE NUAFESILI PIERRE LAUOFO  Deputy Prime Minister of Samoa and ex-officio Vice-President of the Conference  briefing on the 3 September multi-stakeholder partnership dialogue on oceans  seas and biodiversity  said oceans were part of daily life in small island developing States and contributed greatly to their economic activity  particularly through fisheries and tourism.  However  the unsustainable use of marine resources — including overfishing for commercial purposes and illegal and unregistered fishing — had led to a rapid decline in fish stocks.  It was essential to achieve the sustainable use of marine resources  so as to ensure long-term food security and protect rich marine biodiversity.  Integrated  holistic and global approaches should be taken to effectively manage coastal and marine areas.  SIDS  he went on  had an intrinsic economic  social  cultural and environmental connection with oceans and seas  and therefore were well placed to develop sustainable ocean-based economies.  Integrated ecosystem approaches to the management and governance of ocean spaces and activities must be adopted through partnerships.  Those partnerships had been recognized as those related to ocean acidification; a global ocean carbon observatory network; conservation in the Caribbean; strategic cooperation with small island developing States on biodiversity and forestry; marine scientific cooperation; marine capacity-building; and effective management of marine areas. Statements TUILOMA NERONI SLADE  Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum  said his organization was poised to implement the Samoa Pathway document and its members had been involved in the global debate on sustainable development in the context of small island developing States.  The endorsement by Pacific leaders in August in Palau of the Framework for Pacific Regionalism had reinvigorated the agenda for regional cooperation and integration.  Sustainable financing for SIDS must be central  and the criteria for graduation from least-developed-country status must be reviewed to better reflect such States’ vulnerabilities to external economic and physical shocks.  New sources of funding were needed.  The Forum would continue to implement the Forum Compact on Strengthening Development Coordination. RAWLESTON MOORE  the Global Environment Facility  said that  in the coming years  the Facility was seeking to ramp up its investment in renewable energy for small island developing States and collaborate with a broad array of stakeholders to put programmes in place.  Since 1994  the Facility had provided nearly $1 billion in support of sustainable development in such States  and its new four-year funding cycle included the largest amount of resources ever provided for small island developing States.  For 2014-2018  the Facility would make available $256 million for projects to improve the environment  a 9 per cent increase from the previous four-year period.  JAMES MOVICK  Director-General of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency  noting that islands in the Pacific were highly dependent on fisheries  said that per-capita consumption of seafood in some atoll countries was among the highest in the world.  Due to population growth  many countries were expected to face a deficit in the local fish supply in the next 20 years of 100 000 tons.  In the long term  climate change was expected to reduce potential fish production.  He called for the recognition of the rights of coastal States to control fishing opportunities within their own waters; implementation of best practices fisheries management; the removal of overcapacity in the regional and global industrial fishing fleet; effective management of high seas areas; and more consistent support from the international community in terms of their development agendas and their approach to regional fisheries management and trade negotiations. COLIN TUKUITONGA  Director-General of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community  said that a key element for the Pacific region was being able to measure progress and monitor implementation.  The Pacific Community had worked for several years in enhancing national statistical systems and  through the national minimum development indicators database  would continue to work with countries to meet those implementation and monitoring commitments.  The final chapters of the Samoa Pathway called for special attention to implementation  data and statistics  and institutional support for small island developing States  and in an effort to effectively support various institutional mechanisms  the Pacific Community had applied to become a permanent observer to the United Nations. DAVID SHEPPARD  Director-General of the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme  noting that his organization’s vision was to embrace all three pillars of sustainable development  echoed the United Nations Secretary-General’s concern over sea-level rise.  The Marshall Islands  Tuvalu and Kiribati were the lowest-lying islands on Earth.  The Pacific islands contributed 0.03 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions  but would be the first to go under if the dire forecasts of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change came to pass.  The international community must support all island countries to become more resilient  and his Programme worked to build such resilience through the practical implementation of climate adaptation in water  food security and coastal zone management in order to protect and better manage natural ecosystems and island biodiversity  and help countries better manage waste.  He invited all delegates to work on the Programme’s campaign theme of “Natural solutions — building resilience for a changing Pacific”. FILIPE NAINOCA  Secretary-General of the Fiji Red Cross Society  on behalf of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)  said that to create a platform for sustainable growth and poverty eradication  his organization urged Governments  donors and partners to consider a number of actions  including building the capacity and resilience of local institutions for effective partnerships by recognizing the role of volunteers  both in national laws and through support and training; integrating disaster risk reduction and climate change plans into national  regional and international frameworks to enhance development outcomes; making legal frameworks part of disaster preparedness; and investing in and involving youth. MARIAMA WILLIAMS  the South Centre  said the outcome document from Samoa must chart a definitive path forward  building on the foundations of internationally agreed SIDS-specific goals in the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy.  The Samoa Pathway must push the envelope so that small island developing States could participate in more democratic and inclusive global governance arrangements.  The strategy must focus on an international sovereign debt restructuring mechanism that provided preferential treatment for their socioeconomic development  as well as new  adequate and predictable flows of climate finance accessible through simplified direct access methods and driven by SIDS-related adaptation and climate-related needs. JEAN CLAUDE DE L’ESTRAC  Secretary-General of the Indian Ocean Commission  recalling that Member States had repeatedly stressed the inherent vulnerabilities of small island developing States during the Conference  said that those concerns represented a turning point for the future of sustainable development in SIDS.  People in those States were living in an economic and environmental emergency that required differentiated treatment.  Defining and recognizing small island developing States as a category within the United Nations was a precondition to addressing their challenges  and that special treatment should facilitate access by SIDS to new sources of multilateral funding. TANNAO KIRI  International Organization of La Francophonie  stressed the need to establish a global economic system that respected the fact that while nations had different capacities  they all had the same rights.  La Francophonie had provided support that had enabled small island developing States to improve their coordination.  He called for strengthening the United Nations agencies that placed sustainable development at the core of their objectives.  Supporting national strategies for sustainable development in SIDS was crucial.  To boost tourism  a major income generator in many SIDS  his organization had promoted tourism’s benefit to local communities and the role of sustainable ecotourism in preserving biodiversity.  He stressed the importance of developing tools to generate sustainable tourism to tackle SIDS-related challenges in a cross-cutting fashion.  La Francophonie supported the Samoa Pathway outcome document and would do its part to contribute to its implementation and success. RACHEL KYTE  World Bank Group  said that in recognition of the unique vulnerabilities and challenges facing small island developing States  the Group had tailored national and regional programmes to help SIDS assess social and structural sources of vulnerability  address underlying policy and institutional weakness and build resilience to respond to and manage the effects of global shocks  climate change and natural hazards.  Fourteen small island developing States had access to International Development Association concessional financing under the small islands economies exception despite having gross national income per-capita levels on average four times the Association’s operational cut-off. ROBERTA CLARKE  Executive Director of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women)  said it was vital to end historic  persistent exclusions and to ensure women had equal opportunities to participate in  influence and benefit from political  social and economic governance.  Ensuring women’s and girls’ voices would be a primary indicator of accountability for commitments made in the post-2015 and SIDS agendas.  To meet the goals set forth in the Samoa Pathway outcome document  it was necessary to end all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls  strengthen women’s economic power and ensure their access to productive employment  decent work  ownership and control of land  credit  natural resources  sexual and reproductive health and decision-making processes. WENDY WATSON-WRIGHT  the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  said small island developing States stood on the frontline of change and provided early warnings for the world against global problems.  The Conference carried a strategic weight as it was held ahead of the adoption of a post-2015 development agenda  and she noted that science held the key to the successful sustainable development of small island developing States.  She urged those States to encourage their youth to pursue a career in science.  Traditional knowledge held by indigenous people was also vital  as was a quality education. TIMOTH WILCOX  the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR)  said the Samoa Pathway outcome document was a clear sign that the international community was ready to support small island developing States and to build upon existing achievements towards preventing and managing disaster risk.  The Pacific region led the global effort in integrating climate change adaptation and disaster risk management into one strategic approach.  To address bottlenecks in that regard  the Secretary-General would announce more support measures for the region next month.  His Office welcomed the recognition of the Hyogo Framework for Action in the Samoa Pathway document and called on leaders of small island developing States to bring the message of that document to the upcoming United Nations Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction  in Sendai  Japan. GYAN CHANDRA ACHARYA  Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for the Least Developed Countries  Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States  said that in preparations for the Conference  his Office had organized events on marine science and technology transfer to small island developing States  partnerships in disaster risk reduction and resilience for food and nutrition in small islands.  Recently  his Office partnered with Apple iTunes in an “Island Voices” project featuring a number of artists and music from island States across the globe. BRAULIO FERREIRA DE SOUZA DIAS  Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity Secretariat  said that according to the soon-to-be-released fourth edition of the Global Biodiversity Outlook report  since 2010  national Governments  especially small island developing States  had invested more to address the unacceptable rate of global biodiversity loss.  He noted that by mainstreaming ecosystem services into the larger development agenda  the innovative practices of SIDS in community-based fisheries  integrated coastal and marine ecosystem management and public-private partnerships in tourism had shown that initiatives to stem such loss were possible and expanding.  Still  actual biodiversity loss was accelerating  compounded by climate change  pollution  invasive alien species and the loss of critical ecosystems.  He urged small island developing States to submit to the Convention Secretariat their updated national biodiversity plans in order to identify their scientific and technical cooperation needs  and to ratify the Nagoya Protocol to benefit from the sustainable use of their genetic resources and traditional knowledge in international cooperation and development. MESBAH ABDELKADER ELLAFI ( Libya) said the survival of small island developing States was at stake and measures were needed to mitigate risk.  Those who had financial  technological and other resources should  in the spirit of solidarity  provide those resources to assist SIDS.  The Samoa Pathway outcome document was a point of departure for effective implementation of sustainable development measures for those States. MELCHIADE BUKURU  the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification Secretariat  noting that all small island developing States were parties to the Convention  said those States received substantial support for sustainable land management projects  notably from the Global Environment Facility.  For the first time  SIDS were recognizing that addressing land degradation would be critical to their food security  adaptation to climate change  protection of biodiversity and resilience to natural hazards.  Citing a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report  he said that SIDS were reaching the limit of their land capacity as most had limited land resources.  The loss of just one hectare of productive land was a substantial loss for them  and that land-based adaptation activities  notably through sustainable land management  were vital.  He invited SIDS to use 2015  the year in which the international community was poised to agree on a new development agenda and climate change regime  to secure provisions for land-based adaptation to climate change. BRAHIMA SANOU  the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)  speaking of the correlation between economic progress in small island developing States and the rapid growth of information and communications technology  said that SIDS two decades ago had not been as connected as they were today.  In 1994  less than 1 per cent of the population across small island developing States had mobile-cellular subscriptions  but today that level exceeded 80 per cent.  Internet usage had increased from 0.1 per cent in 1994 to 35 per cent in 2014.  Even when small island developing States graduated from least developed countries status  the Union would accompany them on their development journey with unwavering support.  “We won’t penalize success.  We reward it.” OLAV KJØRVEN  the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  noted the agency’s specific support for small island developing States  citing a joint initiative with 14 Pacific island countries to end preventable child and maternal deaths.  There must be a clear  central focus on ensuring the survival of children from those States.  By 2020  an estimated 175 million children would likely be affected annually by climate change-related disasters  and a strong global climate agreement in 2015 that was capable of safeguarding the future of SIDS and their development would be essential for those nations’ children.  A quality education was particularly important in geographically and economically isolated island States  as was breaking the cycle of high rates of violence against children and women.  There must be a specific target in the post‑2015 development agenda on eliminating abuse  exploitation and all forms of violence against children.  The issues of health  nutrition  water and sanitation should be “headline” goals in the final report of the Open-Ended Working Group on the Sustainable Development Goals and the Samoa Pathway document. LAURENT ZESSLER  the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)  said his agency had provided commodities for reproductive health and family planning to small island developing States and was leading efforts to ensure that the specific needs of women and girls in SIDS were carefully considered.  Climate change had been the focus of the Conference and rightly so.  If the core of adaptation to climate change was a resilient  secure and empowered people  then reproductive health was a prerequisite.  Universal access to reproductive health was fundamental to sustainable development as it prevented early marriage and early pregnancy  and ensured educational attainment  particularly for women and girls. PRADEEP MONGA  the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)  said that together with “SIDS Dock” and Austria  the agency had recently launched an innovative South-South partnership to create a network of regional sustainable energy centres for small island developing States in Africa  the Caribbean  the Pacific and the Indian Ocean.  UNIDO had assisted the Secretariat of the Pacific Community and the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency  raising awareness for the potential fisheries could have towards improving the livelihoods and food security in the Pacific region.  He noted that the agency had today signed a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Barbados to promote eco-friendly innovative industrial infrastructure and clean energy technologies. XAVIER MARET  the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  said his organization had partnered with small island developing States — including Antigua and Barbuda  Saint Kitts and Nevis  Grenada  the Solomon Islands  Comoros and Sao Tome and Principe — in  support of their efforts to come out of the global financial crisis that had broken in 2008.  Further  IMF had helped some countries  including Haiti  Dominica  Saint Lucia  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the Solomon Islands  to get back on their feet following the devastation caused by natural hazards.  To better support its member countries  IMF had increased its lending capacity and approved in 2009 a major overhaul of its lending facilities framework by offering higher amounts and tailoring loan terms to countries’ varying strengths and circumstances.  The non-concessional Rapid Financing Instrument had been introduced to replace and broaden the scope of earlier emergency assistance facility  and criteria to qualify for concessional lending under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust had been eased in 2013.  The latter measure had allowed the Marshall Islands  the Federated States of Micronesia and Tuvalu to be eligible  and also kept Dominica and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines eligible — which would otherwise have graduated. SHAMSHAD AKHTAR  Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)  said the Commission had been working to implement the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy  trying to deepen and sharpen regional support for small island developing States.  The Samoa Pathway document reinforced the role of regional commissions  institutions and bodies in laying out a road map for sustainable development.  The role of ESCAP was to reinforce the Samoa Pathway  and it would nurture stronger regional solidarity among small island developing States.  In regards to policymaking  ESCAP was trying to equip Pacific economies in an effort to place them on the path towards sustainable green growth  and it had worked with Pacific regional bodies to implement that goal.  The Commission aimed to nurture connectivity for sustainable maritime development  bolster national disaster risk reduction efforts and create subregional statistics on the Millennium Development Goals for the Pacific region. TIME RWABUNEMBA  the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)  said the world had seen record-breaking declines in new HIV infections — a 38 per cent drop since 2001.  Further  AIDS-related deaths were at their lowest levels  down 35 per cent since 2005.  Small island developing States had done relatively well.  Haiti had seen a 44 per cent drop in HIV infections since 2005  while many Pacific island countries and territories had experienced a low-level HIV epidemic.  Five countries — the Cook Islands  Nauru  Niue  Tokelau and Pitcairn — had reported having no people living with HIV.  Progress was fragile and gains need to be sustained.  Now was not the time for complacency  given the context of serious global challenges. STEPHEN GRAFF  the Asian Development Bank  noting that 14 small island developing States were members of the institution  said the Bank in the last decade had almost quadrupled its portfolio of operations in such States  from $500 million to $1.9 billion.  As well as providing cheap concessional financing  the Bank was now providing grants for many of the most vulnerable countries.  It had helped SIDS respond to the global economic crises of 2008 and 2009  and in the past five years  had played a central role working with partners — including Australia  New Zealand  the World Bank and the European Union — to provide flexible budget support  helping SIDS rebuild buffers and maintain essential health and education services during an economic downturn.  The Bank was the largest single source of financing for renewable energy among its SIDS members  financing 5 per cent of those nations’ total renewable energy capacity in the past three years. ACHILLE BASSILEKIN  the African  Caribbean and Pacific Group of States  said he trusted that the means of implementation of the Samoa Pathway outcome document would be adequately addressed to ensure that it could be and would be implemented and not just mere words put together to ensure that those with the greatest responsibility could have an escape route not to fulfil their commitments and obligations. New  additional and predictable financial resources were urgently needed to effectively respond to the development challenges of small island developing States. ROBERT KYLOH  the International Labour Organization (ILO)  welcomed the Conference discussions and said that the Samoa Pathway outcome document had addressed the need for sustained economic growth with decent work for all.  Given that the ability of small island developing States to sustain high levels of economic growth and job creation had been adversely affected by several factors  they warranted the international community’s strong support.  Youth unemployment was critical in SIDS and was associated with high levels of crime and drugs  and investment in high-quality training and education was essential to any component for tackling that  as were policies and programmes that directly created more jobs.  ILO engaged heavily in direct job creation with construction of rural road and infrastructure among poor communities in SIDS.  Migrant workers played an important role in enhancing development of their home communities.  Growth must be inclusive and equitable  and to ensure that  the introduction of a social protection floor  appropriate wages and labour bargaining rights was vital. SHANTAL MUNRO KNIGHT  the Caribbean Policy Development Centre  speaking on behalf of the non-governmental organizations major group  said that non-governmental groups were critical partners who brought wide and varying capacities to the process.  They were service providers  innovators  capacity-builders and -mobilizers  policy advocates and technical experts.  They contributed tangibly to the small island developing States agenda  but their work and value often went unacknowledged.  Her group called for the reformulation of the global governance architecture to give small island developing States an equitable voice in international decision-making processes on climate change  economic development  social development  human rights and environmental conservation  as well as the creation of an enabling environment for civil society engagement at all levels of governance in sustainable development processes. FLORENCE PIGNOLET TARDAN  Conseil Régional de la Réunion  speaking on behalf of the local authorities major group  said it worked to develop South-South cooperation  including among small island developing States of the Indian Ocean.  The islands had devised a draft declaration on climate change  which called for recognition that they played a watchdog role in climate change.  The group called for solidarity with small island developing States and mechanisms to enable those States to adapt to and mitigate climate change.  Further  they proposed establishment of a vulnerability resilience index for islands to prioritize financing  a debt relief initiative devised by the Government of the Seychelles and the Paris Club  creation of an energy hub for the Indian Ocean for the transfer of skills  and development of a low-carbon economy.  That initiative showed the dynamism and commitment of SIDS and inter-State authorities in combating climate change and the desire to make the transition towards a sustainable energy-efficient economy. PAMELA THOMAS  the Caribbean Farmers' Network  speaking on behalf of the farmers major group  said that investment in agriculture had declined for several years across many small island developing States  particularly those in the Caribbean region.  After the food-price crisis of 2008  Governments  donors and institutions had made agriculture a priority.  However  climate change impacts  such as flooding  drought and higher temperatures  had affected agricultural production and the livelihood of farmers across small island developing States.  Those countries must develop and design support mechanisms and infrastructure that facilitated the setting up of climate smart farms  thereby creating a more sustainable agricultural sector and advancing Caribbean food security.  That would mean engaging in partnership agreements  dialogues and adaptive strategies to lessen the yield losses and avert food insecurity in the region. KLAUS STUNZNER  the Pacific Islands Private Sector Organization  speaking on behalf of the business and industry major group  said that prior to the Conference  the Samoa Chamber of Commerce  the Government and the United Nations Office of the High Representative for Least Developed Countries  Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States had convened a private-sector partnerships forum.  Some 400 participants from various sectors had focused on seven thematic areas: oceans and marine resources; connectivity; sustainable agriculture; sustainable tourism; disaster risk reduction; renewable energy; and financing and support measures for the SIDS private sector.  Approximately 20 concrete partnerships  initiatives and recommendations had been announced  and a SIDS global network had been established.  The industry welcomed the Conference outcome  particularly the section on sustained and sustainable inclusive and equitable economic growth with decent work for all. DANIELE VIOLETTI  the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  said the world had become cognizant of the challenges in keeping the rise in global temperature to less than 2°C  and to tackle climate change  it was necessary to achieve climate neutrality by balancing carbon emissions with an equal amount sequestered of offset.  National policies must move every country towards reducing emissions and supporting a new climate agreement.  For that to happen  business must be on board.  Investment and industry must wake up to the fact that action on climate change was needed  that renewable energy and energy efficiency were wise investments and that green bonds were safer for investors in the long term.  The public must join the solution as businesses and Governments could not act alone.  Tokelau was the first country run completely on renewable energy.  So many countries during the Conference had announced similar ambitious targets and island States were taking the lead in that regard through partnerships to show that a climate-safe future was a prosperous future. LUCINDA LONGCROFT  the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)  said her agency was mandated to promote and develop a balanced international intellectual property system for the cultural  economic and social development of all countries.  WIPO  with its 187 member States  supported capacity-development at the national level and efforts to use intellectual property as a tool towards meeting national development policy goals.  The agency was committed to helping small island developing States use their wealth of cultural and innovative resources to meet their development challenges and goals  and she noted that its partnerships in those States took many forms both in cultural and technological sectors.  Advanced Search  The Secretary-General commended the European Commission’s new target to reduce  by 2030  greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels.  The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.
