2014-10-23,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16277.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The following statement was issued today by the Spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon: The Secretary-General strongly commends the decision of the European Commission to set a new target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels by 2030.  The decision demonstrates the continued global leadership of the European Union on taking bold action to address climate change. Today  European Union leaders have once again placed Europe in a leading position with an ambitious emissions reduction target.  He congratulates European Council President Herman Van Rompuy  European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and European Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard for their vision  leadership and commitment  which made this positive outcome possible. In adopting this target  the European Union has shown that addressing global climate needs is in its own long-term interest.  The decision will lead to tangible and significant contributions towards our collective effort to keep temperature rise to less than two degrees Celsius this century.  The decision will also set a new standard for climate ambition for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.   The Secretary-General urges all countries to act swiftly and boldly on climate change and to make every effort to reach an ambitious climate agreement by the end of 2015.

Following is the text of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s video message to the Warsaw Dialogue for Democracy  held in Warsaw 23 to 25 October: I commend you for observing the twenty-fifth anniversary of Poland’s transition to democracy with a global dialogue on ways to reverse the shrinking space for civil society. In some places  the alarming trend is happening through overt means of oppression  such as increasingly restrictive laws and the persecution of activists and journalists.  In others  it is done by marginalizing civil society in national and international decision-making processes.  Wherever it happens  it is a violation of human rights and a threat to our future. Democracy is the product of an active and vocal civil society.  Without that  it cannot breathe.  And as we have seen  time and again  where societies and governance systems are not broad-based  inclusive  responsive and accountable  it is difficult for peace  security and development to take hold.  I especially encourage you to look at ways to secure space for young people to play a role in helping shape the future of civil society.  Today  they make up the largest generation of young people in history.  They are connected and committed like no generation before. The United Nations is ready to work with you to give young people the opportunity to make their voices heard.  Let us give them room to build a better future for all.  Let us find ways to keep society civil for generations to come.

2014-10-22,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16275.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks at the United Nations Foundation/United Nations Association Global Leadership Dinner  as prepared for delivery  in New York on 22 October: It is a pleasure to join you.  What a wonderful gathering.  I am a huge fan of Ted Turner  and not just because of his visionary philanthropic contributions to the United Nations.  We both love classic movies!  You might think I spend time at my residence reading reports and briefing papers.  In fact I am tuned to the Turner Classic Movie channel  catching up on Shane  Casablanca and Gone with the Wind! For the United Nations  Ted Turner is a real-life action hero.  That means Kathy Calvin must be Superwoman  able to leap high political hurdles in Washington  D.C.  in a single bound! Thank you both  and all the staff of the United Nations Foundation  for supporting the United Nations here in the United States and around the world.  I would also like to acknowledge the presence of my distinguished predecessor  Kofi Annan  and all the other good friends  colleagues and former colleagues who are here tonight.  Thank you all for everything you do for the United Nations and for me personally. I join you all in congratulating tonight’s honourees.  Some are advocates for the vulnerable and oppressed.  Others are fighting for the rights of women and young people.  Still others are trying to steer the world away from climate catastrophe and toward a world of prosperity  good health and dignity for all.  The honourees come from different walks of life.  But they all recognize the immense value of the United Nations.  And all are planting seeds of hope in our troubled soil of a turbulent global landscape. The world faces multiple crises  from armed conflicts to extremism to the outbreak of Ebola.  Too many people continue to face exploitation  from factories to farms  from bonded labour to sexual slavery. The United Nations is addressing today’s emergencies.  At the same time  we are striving to seize tomorrow’s opportunities.  Last month  we reported that child mortality has been cut in half since 1990.  This is huge progress — and just one sign of the remarkable global mobilization behind the Millennium Development Goals.  Even on Ebola  earlier this week we were able to declare Nigeria and Senegal free of the virus.  This shows that the outbreak can be contained — with partnership and investments in health systems. The key year of 2015 is just weeks away.  Crucial discussions are under way to achieve a universal climate agreement and a bold post-2015 development agenda.  Next year also marks the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations.  The founding of the Organization was a solemn pledge to the world’s people to end assaults on human dignity  and lead the way to a better future.  This vision can be realized if concerned global citizens step up and speak out. I see that constituency here tonight.  You — the United Nations Foundation and the United Nations Association — connect people and the United Nations.  You explain why the United Nations matters.  And you help individuals contribute to our global mission.  I am very encouraged by the poll results announced today that once again show very strong American support for burden-sharing and problem-solving through the United Nations. There have been setbacks  and today we see many dark clouds.  But I am convinced that we can stand up for UN principles and achieve the transformation we seek — the future we want.  Let us work together to press all those in power to live up to their political and moral responsibilities.  And let us be inspired by the honourees and other leaders here tonight to build a better world for all. Thank you.

The following statement was issued today by the Spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon: The Secretary-General welcomes the growing number of financial and in-kind commitments many countries are making to the global Ebola response.  Ebola is a major problem that demands a massive and immediate response.  Needs include trained medical personnel  mobile laboratories  vehicles  helicopters  protective equipment and MEDEVAC capacities.  The Secretary General has established the United Nations Ebola Multi-Partner Trust Fund to provide a flexible  accountable  strategic and transparent platform to finance critical unfunded priorities and help to reduce the rate of Ebola transmission. The Secretary-General thanks the Governments of Australia  Colombia and Venezuela for financial deposits and commitments to the Trust Fund totalling nearly $14 million.  The Republic of Korea has announced its pledge of $5 million to the Trust Fund today.  Commitments and pledges to the Fund currently stand at $50 million  but much more is needed.  The Secretary-General urges all countries that have contributed to consider what more they can do  and those who have yet to contribute to do so as a matter of urgency. The only way to end the Ebola crisis is to end the epidemic at its source.  The people and Governments of West Africa are demonstrating significant resilience.

2014-10-21,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16274.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks  as prepared for delivery  at the launch of the United Nations Impact J. Michael Adams Conversation Series  in New York today: I am delighted to welcome you all here.  Let me especially thank Mrs. Susan Adams for joining us as we launch this special event in the context of the UN’s seventieth anniversary. I deeply admired Dr. J. Michael Adams during his life  and I am honoured for this opportunity to launch a conversation series that will carry on his name in the future. Dr. Adams forged deep ties between Fairleigh Dickinson University and the United Nations.  He once said  “The only path to peace is education and dialogue.  Tanks don’t work.  That’s why we take so seriously our association with the United Nations.” He was a pioneer in bringing academia and the UN together.  As President of Fairleigh Dickinson  he enabled it to become the first university to receive consultative status with the UN Economic and Social Council. Dr. Adams did more than bring his own university closer to the UN; he helped develop the UN Academic Impact — which is connecting the United Nations to universities around the world.  This initiative matches academic innovation with the UN’s mission to overcome the most pressing problems in our world. We are aiming to draw on the insights of professors  researchers and students to address challenges to peace  security  development and human dignity. Dr. Adams was by my side when we launched UNAI [United Nations Academic Impact].  He had been a constant guide  from the time the UN first suggested the idea to the International Association of University Presidents in 2005  to its formal launch five years later. Perhaps we were such close friends because we shared an unwavering conviction in the transformative power of education.  Education was the engine that drove progress in my life and my country.  That is why I am doing everything possible to champion education around the world. I am committed to the success of the United Nations Academic Impact and my Global Education First initiative.  In this effort  we have had many advocates.  We were fortunate to welcome Malala Yousafzai to the United Nations on two occasions to rally the world for the right to education. We lost Dr. Adams  but I am heartened that the United Nations will keep his spirit and memory alive through this series. Ladies and gentlemen  I am confident Dr. Adams would have been proud of our choice for the first leader in this conversation series.  Dr. Hayat Sindi is a pioneering academic and medical researcher from Saudi Arabia who became the first woman from her region to obtain a PhD in biotechnology. The United Nations is proud to have Dr. Sindi serving as a UNESCO [United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization] Goodwill Ambassador.  She shatters stereotypes.  She inspires others  especially girls and women.  And she is not satisfied with achieving excellence just for herself — she is also helping youth in her region and our world to realize their own enormous potential. Dr. Sindi once said  “It makes sense that those who become qualified should spread their contributions where it is needed:  to the less privileged.”  Let us be inspired by her spirit of human solidarity as we start this meaningful conversation series.

Malala is a brave and gentle champion of peace who through the simple act of going to school became a global teacher.  She said one pen can change the world.  With great courage  she has shown what terrorists fear most: a girl with a book. The United Nations will continue to stand with her against extremism and for the right of girls everywhere  to learn and live freely and make the most of their tremendous potential.  Malala is a daughter of the United Nations — and a hero to the world. Thank you  Malala  for supporting United Nations causes and embodying United Nations ideals.

2014-10-21,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16272.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. The following statement was issued today by the Spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon: The Secretary-General condemns the decision of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to expel from the country Scott Campbell  Director of the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office.  He is also deeply concerned by recent threats against other staff of the Joint Office  in connection with their human rights work. The Secretary-General recalls that the Congolese people have suffered grave human rights violations  which the Joint Office has  over the years  helped to document as it seeks to promote and protect their rights  while strengthening justice and accountability.  Respect for human rights is absolutely essential for long-term peace and stability in the country.  The Joint Office and the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) as a whole are mandated by the Security Council to assist the Government and its people in that regard.  By impeding the United Nations’ human rights work  the Government is failing to uphold its obligations.  Doing so can only be harmful for the country’s progress. In keeping with the Human Rights Up Front initiative  the Secretary-General reiterates that United Nations staff must never be threatened or sanctioned for doing their work  which is based on the United Nations Charter and  in this instance  mandated by the Security Council.  He expresses his full confidence in Mr. Campbell.  He urges the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to reconsider its position on his expulsion and to take urgent action to address the threats against other staff.  He encourages the Security Council to consider the implications for its work and objectives when United Nations staff are treated in this manner and to consider possible actions.

2014-10-21,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsmm16270.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks to the Security Council on the situation in the Middle East  in New York today: I thank Argentina for organizing this important briefing session.  As you know  I returned last week from Egypt  Israel and Palestine  which included my first visit to Gaza since this summer’s conflict. In Egypt  I attended the Conference on Palestine which focused on Gaza’s reconstruction.  I would like to thank the co-chairs  Egypt and Norway  for their leadership. The event surpassed expectations with pledges from some 50 countries amounting to $5.4 billion.  It is important that these promises quickly materialize into concrete assistance on the ground.  The clock is ticking.  $414 million is immediately needed for humanitarian relief  $1.2 billion for early recovery needs and $2.4 billion for reconstruction efforts. More than 100 000 residents of Gaza remain homeless  with over 50 000 still sheltering in UNRWA [United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East] school buildings.  Many still lack access to the municipal water network.  Blackouts of up to 18 hours per day are common.  Meanwhile  winter is approaching. I urge the international community to move quickly to deliver much-needed assistance.  Nothing could have prepared me for what I witnessed in Gaza.  I saw mile after mile of wholesale destruction.  I visited a United Nations school in the Jabalia refugee camp which was shelled during the hostilities.  Civilians had sought protection under the UN flag. Parents and children shared heart-wrenching accounts of suffering and pain.  I met a young man whose brothers and sisters perished in the blasts.  He is now confined to a wheelchair  having lost his legs.  I look forward to a thorough investigation by the Israeli Defense Forces of this and other incidents in which UN facilities sustained hits and many innocent people were killed. I am planning to move forward with an independent board of inquiry to look into the most serious of those cases  as well as instances in which weaponry was found on UN premises. Israelis also suffered during the conflict.  I travelled to a kibbutz where I met the grieving family of a four-year-old child named Daniel who was killed by a Hamas rocket — another innocent victim of this mindless conflict.  As I said in Gaza  firing rockets is unacceptable  and the rockets have brought nothing but suffering. I also visited a tunnel built by militants to launch attacks.  I fully understand the security threat to Israel from rockets above and tunnels below.  At the same time  the scale of the destruction in Gaza has left deep questions about proportionality and the need for accountability. Despite the harsh reality on the ground  I left Gaza with a measure of hope.  During my visit to Gaza  the first supplies of urgently needed construction materials entered Gaza under the temporary mechanism brokered by my Special Coordinator.  If implemented in good faith  this mechanism can help bring stability to Gaza. I also welcome the offer by Turkey of a ship to serve as a temporary power plant and Israel’s positive consideration of this arrangement.  This is the kind of action and cooperation needed now to alleviate the situation in Gaza. Palestinians are taking critical steps to forge a united path to the future.  This includes an intra-Palestinian reconciliation agreement  followed by a historic meeting in Gaza of the Cabinet of the Government of National Consensus.  A united Palestinian Government is beginning to take shape. During my visit  I met Prime Minister [Rami] Hamdallah and his Cabinet in Ramallah and Deputy Prime Minister [Ziad] Abu Amr and several Ministers in Gaza to further underscore UN support for a unified Palestinian leadership.  The national consensus Government must be consolidated so it can assume its rightful responsibilities in Gaza  including deployment to the border crossings. This is crucial  as effective management of Gaza’s borders will facilitate the flow of construction materials into Gaza and allow the restoration of trade between Gaza and the West Bank. Civil and administrative reform and other related issues must also become a priority to help unify the two separate strands of administration for the Gaza Strip.  I welcome the generous contribution by the Government of Qatar and the Emir  His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani  towards a one-time humanitarian payment by the end of this month in Gaza for a number of civil service employees. Notwithstanding the immediate needs in Gaza  the situation in the West Bank demands renewed attention.  In my meetings in Jerusalem  I reiterated my deep concerns about plans to construct residential housing units in occupied East Jerusalem.  International law is clear:  settlement activity is illegal.  It runs totally counter to the pursuit of a two-State solution.  I urge the Israeli Government to reverse these activities. I also remain deeply concerned by unilateral actions  restrictions and provocations at the Holy Sites in Jerusalem.  I take note of Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu’s personal assurance to me in Jerusalem of his Government’s commitment to refrain from altering policies with respect to the holy sites that have been in place over many decades. I am also concerned about mounting numbers of attacks by settlers and others  as well as Israeli plans to “relocate” some 7 000 Palestinian Bedouins  the majority of whom are refugees  from their current locations in the central West Bank  including in the strategic E1 area.  Such an action  if implemented in a forcible manner  would be contrary to international human rights and humanitarian law. The cycle of build and destroy must end.  The international community cannot be expected to continually pick up the pieces of another war and then pick up the bill.  As I said in Cairo  let this be the last Gaza reconstruction conference. I welcome the planned resumption of indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and the Palestinians  under Egyptian auspices in Cairo.  I also recognize positive steps by Israel to ease restrictions on movement and trade in the West Bank and Gaza.  These must be further expanded. But  as I repeated throughout my visit to the region  there is no hope for long-term stability in Gaza without addressing the underlying causes of the conflict:  an end to the occupation that has grinded on for nearly half a century  a full lifting of the blockade on the Gaza Strip and effectively addressing Israel’s legitimate security concerns.  Ultimately  long-term stability requires a comprehensive peace agreement leading to a viable and independent Palestinian State. Leaders on both sides must overcome their differences and dispense with the unilateral initiatives that serve only to fuel mistrust and polarization.  The two-State solution is the only viable option for a durable peace.  It is time for courage and vision to make the tough compromises that are needed now.  I challenge both sides to rise to the occasion. Allow me to use this opportunity to also say a few words about Syria and Lebanon  neither of which can be considered in isolation from the broader context.  On Syria  last week I called on all parties to step up to protect civilians in the town of Ayn al-Arab/Kobane.  Ayn-al Arab/Kobane is just one of many places across Syria where civilians are under imminent threat. In addition to the barbarity of ISIL [Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham] or Da’esh  the Syrian Government continues to brutally and indiscriminately attack populated areas  including with barrel bombs.  Our long-term strategic objective in Syria remains a political solution based on the Geneva Communiqué. A purely military response to the vicious new threat posed by Da’esh could ultimately contribute to the radicalization of other Sunni armed groups and spark a cycle of renewed violence.  I urge your full support for my Special Envoy’s efforts to reduce the suffering of the Syrian people and contribute to a political solution. In Lebanon  I am troubled by a dangerous escalation since the August attacks by Da’esh and Nusra Front on Arsal  the latest fighting earlier this month between the Nusra Front and Hizbullah outside the Town of Brital.  I welcome efforts by Prime Minister [Tamam] Salam and Lebanese leaders to uphold national unity.  The Lebanese parties should urgently demonstrate flexibility to open the way for the election of a President of the Republic of Lebanon without further delay. In this context  the challenge of the refugee presence in Lebanon has become ever more complex.  I welcome the upcoming meeting of the International Support Group for Lebanon in Berlin on 28 October. Finally  I would like to underscore the importance of ensuring calm continues to prevail along the Blue Line.  This is vital to the stability of Lebanon and the region.  I welcome the re-commitment by both Lebanon and Israel to their obligations under [Security Council] resolution 1701 (2006) and to cooperating fully with UNIFIL [United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]. Thank you once again for this opportunity and thank you for your attention.  Let us work together to bring long-sought peace and lasting stability to the people of the Middle East.  Thank you.

Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s message on the Ebola epidemic to the Summit of Heads of State of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our Americas (ALBA)  delivered by David Nabarro  the Special Envoy on Ebola  in Havana today: I am pleased to send greetings to this important meeting.  Ebola is a major global problem that demands a massive and immediate global response.  I welcome the decision of the Government of Cuba to convene this extraordinary Summit of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of our Americas to define the joint contribution of ALBA members to resolve this complex emergency and prevent the spread of Ebola to ALBA Member States. Cooperation and solidarity are essential.  I urge countries in the region and around the world to follow the lead of Cuba and Venezuela  who have set a commendable example with their rapid response in support of efforts to contain Ebola. The Government of Cuba dispatched a team of 165 medical aid workers to West Africa in early October  and I welcome Cuba’s plans to send more medical workers soon.  Cuba’s solidarity with other developing countries is well established.  Over the years  Cuba has sent thousands of medical workers abroad  including to 39 African countries.  Cuba’s proud tradition of training doctors from developing countries has also helped improve medical care around the world. Venezuela has responded swiftly and generously by contributing $5 million to the UN Ebola Response Multi-Partner Trust Fund.  The Fund is a flexible  accountable  strategic and transparent channel for governments  businesses and foundations to support the needs and requirements of United Nations agencies  funds and programmes and other partners working to eliminate Ebola in West Africa. Ebola is no longer a localized public health emergency.  It has wide and profound economic  humanitarian  political and security dimensions.  We must act decisively to relieve the burden on the people and Governments of Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone and stop the spread of Ebola to other countries. By convening this timely Summit  ALBA Member States can substantially assist in attaining these objectives.  I wish you a productive meeting.

Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks at the Economic and Social Council special event entitled “CERN [European Organization for Nuclear Research]: Sixty Years of Science for Peace and Development” in New York today: I thank the Ambassador Martin Sajdik  President of the Economic and Social Council  for hosting this special event.  I also want to express my appreciation to Professor Rolf Heuer  Director-General of CERN  for co-organizing this gathering. This event reaffirms the important role of science and technology in promoting progress and peace.  Science has at times been used for harmful purposes.  Discoveries about the atom were used to create nuclear weapons.  The arms race absorbed scientific talent and financial resources that could have been used to address the pressing problems facing humanity. Fortunately  science is far more often a powerful force for progress and human well-being  especially in developing countries.  Whether we are trying to address climate change  stop the Ebola virus  deal with cybersecurity threats  or curb nuclear proliferation  we need scientists with a clear vision and a commitment to work together to find solutions. I call on the scientific community to invest a significant proportion of its talent and resources over the coming year to research that would accelerate achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and the future sustainable development goals.  I would also like to make a plea for greater efforts to attract more women and girls to science and technology-related fields.  Unleashing women’s innovation potential must be a priority. I attach great importance to expanding the role of science in the work of the United Nations.  This is one of the reasons I have created a scientific advisory board to advise me on the science-policy interface.  The Board will prepare regular scientific assessments in matters of science  technology and innovation  especially for sustainable development. This will help the United Nations to strengthen the link between science and policy.  It will also improve understanding of our “planetary boundaries”  “tipping points” and “environmental thresholds”.  I have high hopes for the impact the Board will make in strengthening evidence-based policymaking. As we pursue these hugely important efforts  we can be inspired by the work done by CERN.  CERN’s scientific discovery involving the Hadron Collider and its research on the World Wide Web have been truly groundbreaking.  I applaud CERN for its collaboration with the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and other UN agencies and invite the organization to strengthen its engagement with the UN system. I am pleased one of CERN’s experts is serving on the UN Scientific Advisory Board in her personal capacity.  I also invite CERN  as an institution  to work more closely with the Board.  We need your expertise to address global development challenges. I have had the honour to visit CERN twice in recent years  and to plunge deep underground to see its remarkable facilities.  CERN makes its visitors wear hard hats for their protection.  As it happens  those helmets are blue — so I felt at home!  The Large Hadron Collider is awesome to behold — a monument to human ingenuity.  But I was just as impressed by the people I met  especially the young scientists and engineers from many nations who work there.  CERN is giving them the opportunity to explore their own potential even as they explore the boundaries of science. It is said that those who go up into outer space come back changed forever.  When I emerged again into the countryside near Geneva  I felt that I  too  had been somewhere special — only in the other direction!  Up again at ground level  one sees cars on the road  birds in the sky  and people rushing about their daily errands.  Meanwhile  down below  deep underfoot  teams of skilled thinkers and technicians and scientists confront the mysteries of existence in order to advance the human condition.  It was a moving experience  and I thank CERN for its hospitality and contributions. The world faces multiple crises.  But this is also an era of opportunity  where great achievements are possible thanks to science  technology and innovation.  To all the scientists and policymakers here today  I urge you to engage even more actively with us in building a world peace  prosperity and dignity for all.  Let me call on the young generation in particular to bring their passion and creativity to this effort.  The United Nations stands ready to work with you.

I thank the Government and people of the Republic of Korea for hosting and for their commitment to the United Nations.  You have important decisions to take concerning the future of information and communications technologies (ICTs) and the strategic direction of this vital sector of the global economy.  Information and communication technologies are a global powerhouse.  They make manufacturing more efficient and provide eco-friendly solutions to manage booming cities and transport systems.  They empower health workers and bring care within reach of people in remote areas.  Mobile phones have connected people as never before.  Broadband networks have made information accessible  helping to bridge the digital divide  especially for women  youth and people living with disabilities. ICTs are  in short  among the keys to achieving sustainable development.  As we shape a new development agenda and strive for a new agreement on climate change  let us continue to work together to harness the power of technology to create an accessible and sustainable future for all.

2014-10-17,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16264.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks at the first substantive informal session of the preparatory process for the third International Conference on Financing for Development  in New York today: It is a great pleasure to be with you today to launch the preparatory process for the third International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in Addis Ababa next July. The year 2015 will make history for sustainable development.  We have three priorities for the year ahead to realize our collective ambition.  First  we must accelerate our efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  Second  we have to agree on a transformative post-2015 development agenda.  Third  we need to achieve a meaningful universal climate agreement in Paris next year. Financing is one of the keys to succeed in all these endeavours.  It will be at the heart of the political agreement that Governments have to reach for a successful sustainable development agenda.  That is why the outcome of the Addis Ababa Conference is so important.  The Conference will be a major stepping-stone for the summit on post-2015 in September next year. Expectations are high.  The road to Addis will be challenging.  All over the world  people have begun focusing on preparations for the Conference.  I sensed the momentum last week at the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Washington  D.C.  Financing for development was at the heart of the discussion.  All partners are eager to support the preparatory process. The United Nations system stands fully behind you.  I have designated the Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs  Mr. Wu Hongbo  as the Secretary-General of the Conference to coordinate our support to the intergovernmental preparations. I am encouraged to see that you have already set yourself an ambitious  substantive agenda.  We must build upon the Monterrey Consensus and Doha Declaration.  At the same time  we have to go forward and address major challenges that have emerged since Monterrey.  These include the impact of the financial crisis  the growth of middle-income countries and the additional costs of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The new financing framework must be broad in scope and  at the same time  concrete.  It should integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development in a balanced manner and seek coherence with other financing streams  including climate finance. The recent report of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing will serve as an important input for the substantive discussions.  It provides an analytical framework and offers policy options.  And by identifying  not only sources of funds  but also uses  the report moves towards a convergence of the Monterrey and Rio processes  thereby setting the stage for Addis Ababa. In view of the large financing needs for sustainable development  financing must be mobilized from all sources — national  international  private and public.  These different types of financing should not be seen as substitutes for official development assistance (ODA)  but rather as complementary and mutually reinforcing elements. ODA will remain crucial.  Resources should be targeted toward those most in need.  Previous commitments must be met.  But  ODA alone will not be sufficient.  The major share of finance for sustainable development and poverty eradication will come from domestic sources  both public and private.  Combating illicit financial flows will also be important in ensuring adequate domestic revenues. Tackling these complex challenges will require hard work and active debate.  In the end  we must come together and agree on a strong  meaningful framework of concrete ways forward.  The Addis Ababa Conference will be a test for the international community.  We cannot afford to fail.  The stakes are too high. We must show our capacity to deliver on a genuine and effective global partnership for the future of our planet and the well-being of future generations.  I call on all Member States to rise to this challenge and make Addis Ababa the success it must be.

2014-10-17,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16263.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks of commemoration at the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty observance event  in New York today: I thank the Permanent Missions of France and Burkina Faso  as well as the Fourth World Movement  for hosting this observance.  The goal of eradicating poverty has been a central aim of the United Nations throughout its history.  I am determined to re-double our efforts to make poverty history. Lives disfigured by poverty are cruel  mean  and often  short.  Our goal must be a world of dignity  opportunity and well-being  where no one is left behind.  The poor and vulnerable are themselves indispensable partners in this work.  Their knowledge and perspectives are vital if we are to find meaningful  durable solutions. We must all ensure that the voices of people living in poverty are not only heard  but acted upon.  Member States are showing a strong commitment to ensuring that poverty eradication is at the heart of the post-2015 development agenda.  Together  we have made remarkable progress.  At least 700 million people were lifted out of extreme poverty between 1990 and 2010. Despite this enormous success  one of five persons in developing regions lives on less than $1.25 a day.  Where poverty persists  development gains are difficult to achieve and even harder to sustain.  Where poverty and inequality are entrenched  instability and conflict are far more likely to erupt.  Where poverty holds sway anywhere  people are held back everywhere. Our discussion of poverty today would not be complete without mentioning the risks posed by the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa.  The disease is a threat  not only to health  but to economic progress and the inroads against poverty that were being made in the region.  Ebola is a huge and urgent global problem that demands a huge and urgent global response. I salute the courage of the many medical and support personnel who are working at great personal risk on the front lines of the response to end the Ebola epidemic in Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone.  The people and Governments of West Africa are demonstrating significant resilience.  We all have a responsibility to provide the assistance for which they have asked. Dozens of countries are showing their solidarity.  But  we need to turn pledges into action — now.  We need at least a 20-fold surge in assistance — mobile laboratories  vehicles  helicopters  protective equipment  trained medical personnel and medevac capacities. I have appealed for $1 billion for a Flexible  Accountable  Strategic and Transparent fund to help reduce the rate of transmission by 1 December.  That stands for FAST.  I repeat:  Flexible  Accountable  Strategic and Transparent.  Ebola transmission is rising exponentially.  That means more cases  more deaths  more grief and more poverty.  It is essential that Governments step up now to avoid even greater needs tomorrow. The United Nations system has mobilized to meet this monumental task.  We have established UNMEER — the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response — to coordinate and scale up action.  But  the United Nations cannot do this alone; no organization can.  The fight against Ebola requires greater international cooperation.  That is why I have also formed a Global Ebola Response Coalition. The disease can be beaten by a rapid and robust response.  Every day matters.  Every contribution matters.  The United Nations will continue to work with all partners to bring the disease under control. As we accelerate work towards the Millennium Development Goals  shape a post-2015 agenda and seek an agreement on climate change  let us keep the eradication of poverty in all its dimensions at the centre.  I urge Member States and all partners to act decisively together to build a sustainable  peaceful  prosperous and equitable future for all. Thank you for your commitment.

Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks  as prepared for delivery  at the Asia Society’s “Game Changer” Awards  in New York today: I thank my good friend Josette Sheeran for her leadership of the Asia Society since taking the helm last year.  She made remarkable contributions to the United Nations when she was “one of us”  and she will always be a part of the UN family.  It is a pleasure to join you this evening. You have come together to celebrate an array of remarkable Asians.  I think the world got a head start on tonight’s ceremony with the announcement last week that this year’s Nobel Prize for Peace is shared by two remarkable Asians. Congratulations again to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai.  They give hope to people around the world struggling against exploitation  discrimination and violence.  They are also good friends of the United Nations.  Both have brought their calls for empowering children to UN gatherings.  The United Nations will continue to support their vitally important work. These are difficult times for the human family.  We face multiple crises  from the conflict in Syria to the outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa.  Too many innocent people are dying needlessly.  Extremism is on the rise and tolerance is on the run. The United Nations continues to respond to global emergencies.  But  we are also keeping our eyes on longer-term opportunities.  The year ahead will be a crucial period for shaping the future sustainable development agenda and taking decisive action on climate change. Asia has a leadership role to play across this agenda.  Asia is a centre of innovation and economic dynamism.  It is thanks to Asia’s robust economic growth that the world can say it has successfully achieved the Millennium Development Goal of cutting poverty in half.  An Asia on the rise means a world on the rise. I am proud to be a son of Asia.  But  I am not blind to the region’s problems.  Two thirds of the world’s poor live in Asia.  Hunger  pollution  gender violence and inequality remain widespread.  Too many people are being left behind. There are also other worrying challenges  including competing territorial or maritime claims  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  backsliding in democratization  the curtailment of human rights and a rise in religious intolerance and ultra-nationalism. I hope that Asia’s people and Governments will not do anything that would put at risk the region’s hard-won prosperity and stability.  I hope all will pursue democracy  protect human rights and advance development that is centred on people and protects the environment.  All of us  in all regions  must make the wise investments in decent jobs  health  nutrition  education  sustainable energy  which are among the true pillars of peace. That is what the Asia Society’s “Game Changer” awards are all about.  From e-commerce to the environment  from the arts to academia  from the sciences to social development  we see Asians helping Asians and building a better world.  Jack Ma  the Society's Game Changer of the Year  is not just an innovative businessperson  but also has a growing profile as a philanthropist and global citizenship.  I look forward to seeing him do even more to support United Nations causes and to turn entrepreneurship into global public goods.  I congratulate all of tonight's award winners for their contributions to advancing human well-being. The world today faces far more man-made crises than natural calamities.  While we cannot control Mother Nature  we can draw on human wisdom to end violence  poverty and discrimination.  That is our political and moral responsibility before the world’s people. I count on all of you — the award winners and global citizens here tonight — to show the leadership and wisdom we need at this time of deep and pressing challenge.

Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s message  delivered by Annika Savill of the United Nations Democracy Fund  to the fourth High-level Meeting of the Inter-regional Dialogue on Democracy held in Washington  D.C.  from 16 to 17 October: It is a pleasure to convey greetings to all the participants in this timely dialogue.  I thank the organizers and hosts — José Miguel Insulza  Secretary-General of the Organization of American States (OAS)  and Yves Leterme  Secretary-General of International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance — for being such good partners in our mission to shape the global development agenda beyond 2015.  I also commend the leaders of all the regional groupings represented at this meeting for their engagement in our shared undertaking. Over the past 15 years  the international community has adopted a series of landmark documents for sustainable development.  The importance of democracy  good governance and the rule of law runs through them like a red thread.  It was highlighted in the Millennium Declaration  at the 2005 World Summit and on many occasions since.  In the Rio+20 outcome document  Governments explicitly stated that sustainable development requires effective  transparent  accountable and democratic institutions at all levels.  And the General Assembly’s Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals recently decided to include a goal on peaceful societies  access to justice and effective institutions. These are universal issues  relevant to the lives of billions  and Governments are responding to calls by their people for accountability and inclusivity.  In the “MY World” survey organized by the United Nations in support of the discussions on the post-2015 development framework  people from all regions ranked “honest and responsive government” as a high priority. As the United Nations works towards a transformative agenda  we have great expectations of all of you gathered for this dialogue on democracy.  Many regional organizations and groupings have stronger policy frameworks in support of democratic governance than those the United Nations has been able to establish so far.  Some of you have worked towards a common regional vision for the future of the development agenda.  Beyond the valuable role your organizations are playing in shaping our common vision beyond 2015  you will also be essential in monitoring its implementation.  The new agenda will require robust accountability mechanisms at the global  regional and national levels  involving all stakeholders.  Your continued engagement will be important in ensuring transparency  inclusiveness and the availability of data. As we look ahead  let us focus on one guiding principle above all: a truly inclusive and participatory approach in setting our agenda and in translating it into reality.  As we have seen around the world  time and again  where societies are not inclusive  and where Governments are not responsive  peace  equality and shared prosperity cannot take hold. I  therefore  ask you to reach out to those who will be at the forefront beyond 2015  and who by nature are at a turning point in their own lives:  young people.  One of every five members of the human family is between the ages of 15 and 24.  Never before have young people had such powers to network — and thus to help advance our vision for a better world.  Your organizations are well placed to listen to their voices  whether expressed directly or through elected representatives.  I look to you as partners of the United Nations in empowering young people  so that they become architects of a future that leaves no one behind. This is a unique moment in our shared mission to mobilize the world and build lives of dignity for all.  I wish you a most productive gathering  and look forward to hearing about the outcome.

Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s message for the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty  observed on 17 October: On this day we recommit to think  decide and act together against extreme poverty  and plan for a world where no one is left behind. We have reached the Millennium Development Goal target of halving the proportion of people living in poverty ahead of time.  At least 700 million people were lifted out of extreme poverty between 1990 and 2010. Despite this enormous success  one in every five persons in developing regions — 1.22 billion people — live on less than $1.25 a day  and 2.4 billion live on less than $2 a day.  Since the beginning of the financial crisis  inequality has grown even more pronounced than it was already.  Discrimination against women and girls remains a blatant injustice  robbing the entire development enterprise of one of the keys to progress. Entrenched poverty and prejudice  and vast gulfs between wealth and destitution  can undermine the fabric of societies and lead to instability.  Where poverty holds sway  people are held back.  Lives disfigured by poverty are cruel  mean and  often  short. As we prepare the post-2015 sustainable development agenda and address the threat of climate change  we must not lose sight of our most fundamental obligation:  to eliminate poverty in all its forms.  We must also end the marginalization of people living in poverty.  Their knowledge and perspectives are vital if we are to find meaningful  durable solutions. I urge Member States and all partners to act decisively together to eradicate poverty and build a sustainable  peaceful  prosperous and equitable future for all.

Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s message for the International Day of Rural Women  to be observed on 15 October: My mother has lived her whole life in the countryside.  Although she did not receive much of a formal education  I grew up appreciating her wisdom  resilience and intelligence.  In the course of my subsequent public service  I came to see that these qualities are shared by millions of rural women around the world. Collectively  rural women are a force that can drive global progress.  We must harness that power to achieve our three interlinked objectives for next year:  accelerating our work towards the Millennium Development Goals  adopting a new vision for sustainable development  and concluding a meaningful universal climate agreement. Because they often live on the frontlines of poverty  natural disasters and other threats  rural women have an enormous stake in the success of our global campaigns. The majority of rural women depend on natural resources for their livelihoods.  In developing countries  they make up more than 40 per cent of the agricultural labour force.  They produce  process and prepare many of society’s meals  frequently taking primary responsibility for household food security  health status and education opportunities. When we give rural women access to productive agricultural and natural resources  we empower them.  They  in turn  can contribute more to alleviating hunger and boosting the ability of their communities to cope with the effects of climate change  land degradation and displacement.  This benefits all people. But to reap these rewards  we must address the discrimination and deprivation that rural women continue to suffer.  Too many lack access to land  markets  finance  social protection and services.  Many also face grave security risks in the course of their life-saving tasks  such as collecting water or fuel.

Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s message on World Food Day  to be held 16 October: Today  and every day  we eat thanks to the labours of family farmers.  They run the vast majority of farms in the world.  They preserve natural resources and agro-biodiversity.  They are the cornerstone of inclusive and sustainable agriculture and food systems. It is fitting that in this International Year of Family Farming  there are 100 million fewer hungry people than just 10 years ago.  Sixty-three countries have halved the portion of their population which is undernourished.  Our vision of zero hunger is within reach. But there is much work to be done.  More than 800 million people do not have enough healthy  nutritious food to lead active lives.  One in three young children is malnourished. Family farmers are key to unlocking global progress.  But they are at a disadvantage when it comes to access to technology  services and markets.  And they are acutely exposed to extreme weather  climate change and environmental degradation.  Ensuring equal access  particularly for women  to productive resources is essential to empowering the world’s 500 million smallholder farmers to help eradicate poverty and safeguard the environment. At the Climate Summit in New York last month  more than a hundred organizations and Governments pledged to work more closely with farmers  fishers and livestock keepers to improve food security and nutrition while addressing climate change.  The Zero Hunger Challenge and the Scaling Up Nutrition movement are catalyzing partnerships with Governments  civil society and the private sector.  The Committee on World Food Security has made impressive progress on responsible investments in agriculture  addressing food losses and waste  and taking action to promote sustainable fisheries and aquaculture. In 2015 we have an opportunity to turn the tide  by achieving the Millennium Development Goals  shaping a new agenda for sustainable development  and fostering a meaningful universal climate agreement.  A world free from poverty and hunger  where all people have realized their right to adequate food  is central to the future we want. On this World Food Day  let us resolve to end hunger in our lifetimes.

Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s message to the forty-first session of the Committee on World Food Security  delivered by Thomas Gass  Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-agency Affairs  in Rome today: I am pleased to send greetings to the forty-first session of the Committee on World Food Security.  When I visited in May  I had the great honour of seeing how the revitalized Committee on Food Security has evolved into the foremost intergovernmental body on food security.  Your focus on knowledge and expertise  on rights  and on effective multi-stakeholder dialogues and partnerships is advancing our shared work to realize my vision of a world with zero hunger. I welcome the Committee’s imminent endorsement of the “Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems”  which you have developed in an inclusive process over the last two years.  The Principles will serve as a new point of reference for all  providing guidance to Governments  investors  businesses  farmers  local communities  intergovernmental organizations and civil society organizations.  Responsible investment is desperately needed  and I share your hope that the Principles will have a positive impact. You will also agree on policy recommendations to reduce food losses and waste in the context of food security  and on how sustainable fisheries and aquaculture can contribute to food security and nutrition. The world is facing multiple humanitarian and political crises  as well as the realities of a changing climate.  I commend the cooperative approach you are taking in working to address these challenges.  I also welcome the attention you are devoting to family farming  women’s empowerment and sustainable food systems.  I urge you to stay engaged  through your capitals and representatives in New York  in the ongoing deliberations on the post-2015 development agenda.  Your expertise continues to play an important role in these discussions  and I reaffirm that you have the full support of my High-level Task Force on Global Food Security. Since its establishment  the Committee on Food Security has envisioned a future without hunger  and I share that vision.  A focus on rights  on sustainable waste-free food systems and on responsible  accountable collaboration between stakeholders will help us tackle the root causes of food and nutrition insecurity.  As we mark the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Right to Food guidelines  I am convinced that an end to hunger is not only possible but can be achieved in our lifetimes.

Following is the text of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s video message to the World Investment Forum today: Excellencies  distinguished leaders from business and civil society  ladies and gentlemen  I am pleased to send greetings to the 2014 World Investment Forum. I thank the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) for bringing you together to focus on the vital issue of investing in sustainable development. Investment  both public and private  has played a key part in progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. It will have an even bigger role in helping to combat climate change and deliver sustainable development. In its 2014 World Investment Report  UNCTAD identifies how all stakeholders can work together to bridge financing gaps. In particular  I commend its Action Plan for Private Investment in the sustainable development goals. There is a strong business case for investing in sustainability. Private sector approaches can help us to innovate. At the same time  collaboration and partnership can ensure that investment in sustainable development is inclusive and aligned with national priorities. This Forum helps to forge such links. You have the opportunity to contribute to improved livelihoods and well-being for billions of people over decades to come. I wish you a successful meeting.

2014-10-12,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16250.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks to the International Conference on Palestine  in Cairo today: I want to thank President [Abdel Fattah] Al Sisi for his initiative.  This important event has helped lay the foundation for what we hope to be a durable ceasefire that must be further consolidated.  I also want to thank Foreign Minister [Sameh Hassan] Shokry [Selim] for his continuing leadership.  Foreign Minister [Børge] Brende  thank you for your country’s leadership and commitment to lasting peace in the Middle East. We are here to show our solidarity.  We are here to stand with the people of Gaza who have endured a terrible summer of suffering.  I want to convey my profound condolences to all those who tragically lost loved ones during the 51 days of conflict.  My thoughts are also with the many who were injured or made homeless.  It is in all their names that we must act. In 2009  the international community gathered in Sharm el-Sheikh in the wake of another devastating war in Gaza.  We pledged our support.  We expressed our commitment.  We resolved to rebuild.  And yet here we are again.  The cycle of building and destroying has continued  only worse. More than 2 100 Palestinians were killed in the most recent war  along with more than 70 Israelis.  Almost one third of Gaza’s population was uprooted from their homes  with many no longer having homes to return to.  Entire neighbourhoods were flattened.  Public infrastructure was demolished.  Blackouts continue up to 18 hours a day.  More than 450 000 people cannot access the municipal water supply network.  Dozens of schools  hospitals and clinics were destroyed or damaged.  United Nations facilities sheltering women and children were hit  resulting in many casualties.  Eleven staff members of the United Nations were killed in the course of the conflict.  Meanwhile rockets fired by Hamas and other armed groups from Gaza continued to be fired indiscriminately causing fear  panic and suffering.  And  of course  the war exacted a toll that may be harder to measure  but that is equally devastating.  Families on both sides  especially children  have suffered deep psychological trauma.  The children of Gaza who have not yet reached grade three have already lived through three wars. The United Nations and international partners have worked hand-in-hand with the Palestinian Authority to address Gaza’s urgent priorities.  But the needs are massive and time is short.  To effectively respond  the humanitarian community in Palestine has worked with the Palestinian Government to develop the “Gaza Crisis Appeal”.  Our “United Nations Support Plan for the Transformation of the Gaza Strip” amounts to about $2.1 billion for early recovery  reconstruction  and other efforts.  These initiatives deserve the most generous support. Ultimately  the successful reconstruction of Gaza requires a strong political foundation.  I am encouraged by the comprehensive reconciliation agreement reached in Cairo on 25 September.  I urge all concerned to ensure that this time  deeds follow words. The United Nations will continue to support the Government of National Consensus as it extends its functions and manages Gaza’s significant and urgent reconstruction needs.  It is essential that our support benefit both refugee and non-refugee populations. I welcome the temporary tripartite agreement brokered by the United Nations to secure entry of reconstruction materials into Gaza.  I am encouraged by the recent historic Palestinian unity Government meeting in Gaza led by Prime Minister [Rami] Hamdallah. My message to all sides is clear.  First  promote an environment conducive for peace  mutual understanding and respect for human rights.  This must include an investigation into potential violations of international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict.  Second  make the most of the vital opportunity presented by the upcoming Cairo talks.  Third  strengthen the ceasefire which is crucial for the resumption of broader peace talks.  Fourth  refrain from unilateral actions which only exacerbate tensions and resentment. Gaza remains a tinderbox.  The people desperately need to see results in their daily lives.  Today.  Now.  Leaders on both sides need to overcome their differences and demonstrate the courage and vision to end the conflict once and for all. I welcome the inflow of funds  resources and staff into the beleaguered Gaza Strip to aid in its reconstruction.  Yet we must not lose sight of the root causes of the recent hostilities:  a restrictive occupation that has lasted almost half a century  the continued denial of Palestinian rights and the lack of tangible progress in peace negotiations. I call on all parties to come together to chart a clear course towards a just and final peace  including achieving a full lifting of the blockade  ensuring Israel’s legitimate security concerns; and establishing two States living side by side in peace and security.  Going back to the status quo is not an option; this is the moment for transformational change.  I urge you to give generously to allow this important work to go forward. I do not want my successors or yours to make conferences such as this a ritual:  building and destroying  and then expecting the international community to foot the bill.  The parties to the conflict must finally make the tough but necessary decisions to enable a brighter future.  Let us each do our part.  Let us commit to make this the most successful conference to rebuild Gaza.  And let it be the last.

2014-10-11,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16249.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks in Tripoli on 11 October: Assalamu alaykom  peace be upon you. I am very honoured to be in Libya once again on my second visit after the revolution.  I am pleased to be joined in this visit by Her Excellency Ms. Federica Mogherini  Italian Foreign Minister and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy designate.  Her presence alongside the United Nations  together with four international envoys from the United Kingdom  France  Italy and Malta  is an illustration of the strong commitment of the international community’s support to Libya. We have also received very strong support from the Arab League Special Envoy  Mr. Nasser al-Kidwa.  We are also thankful to Spain and the United States for the momentum created by the high-level meetings on Libya which they kindly hosted. Libyans launched their revolution because they wanted freedom and democracy.  They wanted human dignity; they wanted prosperity and a better life for their children.  They have a rich and blessed country and want  like peoples everywhere  to enjoy their wealth in a state that respects them  protects them and includes them.  This is what the revolution  admired by the whole international community  was all about. But let me be clear:  if violent confrontations do not cease immediately  if sustainable peace is not restored  prosperity and a better life will be a distant dream.  This is what hangs in the balance today for the future of Libya. Most Libyans agree that the only way ahead for this country is a political process.  This is why the United Nations and the team of my Special Representative  Mr. Bernardino Leon  are helping the Libyans to achieve this goal with the help and support of many Special Envoys and partners.  In that respect  I came to Libya to convey a message of hope. On 29 September  the United Nations organized a meeting of parliamentarians of the House of Representatives in Ghadames.  This constituted a first courageous step on which we will build on.  I am here to support the process that was initiated in Ghadames.  This dialogue will have to be inclusive and representative of all Libyans.  There is no alternative to dialogue.  It is my conviction that all problems in Libya can be solved through dialogue.  Nevertheless  we understand that the path will be long and difficult.  Peacebuilding always is. All parties will have to adopt difficult decisions — hard choices and hard decisions.  This will not be easy.  I would like to praise your courage for accepting to participate and lead in this process.  I am particularly reassured by the strong leadership shown by Mr. Sha’ib and Mr. Bashagha.  In the first place  the purpose of this dialogue will be to put an end to the institutional crisis.  The country cannot afford to be politically divided for such a long time.  Libya needs one parliament that represents all Libyans. The United Nations recognizes and supports the legitimacy of the elected House of Representatives and demands all people to respect it.  But legitimacy has to come with inclusion.  This inclusion entails rules of procedure based on consensus for the most important decisions  as in any parliament  in any democracy  in the world.  The House has to make all Libyans feel represented.  All.  All Libyans. Libya also needs a strong Government able to implement decisions.  A strong Government of national unity  which has full political support and popular backing.  A strong parliament and a strong Government can count on the support of the international community.  But for any political breakthrough to take hold  the fighting has to stop.  The first priority is that fighting must stop.  Then  sit down together to address the root causes.  Enough killings  displacement of people and destruction of property. I call on you  parliamentarians  but also on all the Libyan people  to make all the necessary efforts to ensure that the call for a ceasefire announced in Ghadames is effective.   We know that you do not have direct authority over the armed groups  but strengthening your political institutions will boost your moral authority and will earn you the strong support of the international community. The decision made in Ghadames was to start a parallel process addressing all security issues.  Both processes need to be connected  and you should address all outstanding issues in the country  including security  which constitutes a priority without which there could be no development  political process or respect for human rights.  It is essential that all segments of Libyan society support this dialogue.  To the international community  we would like to stress that all countries should support this political process.  No military intervention will help to resolve the outstanding problems in Libya.  To the forces on the ground  stop the fighting.  As expressed in Security Council resolution 2174 (2014)  the international community cannot tolerate the continuous spilling of Libyan blood.  It cannot also tolerate the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Libyans because of the fighting in different regions. As Italians and Maltese know well  we also see the tragedy that is playing out on the Mediterranean as people  driven by conflict and a lack of opportunity  attempt a desperate crossing to seek a better future for themselves and their families in Europe. That is why it is essential that an effective ceasefire is put in place as a matter of priority.  We ask for all groups to stop fighting; attacks in Benghazi by General Haftar and his forces need to stop  as well as actions by Ansar al Sharia and other groups.  And the same about fighting in the west  where I hope that despite recent tension problems can be solved through dialogue.  All must respect and promote ceasefire.  The United Nations also strongly demands that all military and armed groups withdraw from all Libyan cities  from airports and official buildings  in order to pave the way for legitimate bodies to work and meet the Libyan people’s needs.  We at the United Nations can provide our support towards achieving an effective ceasefire through our political experience and experts.  We acknowledge also that the proliferation and spread of weapons in Libya represents a problem with very negative effects on the ground  which we also need to address together as a matter of priority.  The threat of the spread of terrorism constitutes a matter of concern for Libya and for the international community alike.  Today  you can still work together against chaos.  As I have said repeatedly  military action may kill terrorists  but good governance  inclusive political dialogue and development will defeat terrorism. Trying to alleviate the plight of people affected by the conflict  the United Nations  through its agencies  programmes and funds  has identified priorities for immediate response and is providing assistance to people in need.  The basic premise of the dialogue you have embarked on is that it will be Libyan led. The United Nations will not impose on you any solution.  However  you can rest assured that the United Nations will provide any assistance that is necessary to support you  through the efforts of my Special Representative  Mr. Leon  to solve all your problems and divergence of views peacefully around the negotiating table.  When I appointed Mr. Leon  he was not my direct appointment.  I consulted with the parties.  He has the full confidence of the international community.  What he says  how he acts  represents me.  I am sure  likewise  that this is the same support you will find in your neighbours’ initiatives  like the one proposed by Algeria.  You have agreed to gather here today because you are patriotic Libyans who desire the best for the country.  Let me conclude by stressing once again that the United Nations will always be by your side.  And let us work together very closely.  Go beyond your personal views.  Just put them down for the benefit of your country.

The following statement by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was issued today: I congratulate Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi — two of the world’s greatest champions for children — on being awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize for Peace. Malala is a brave and gentle advocate of peace who through the simple act of going to school  became a global teacher.  She said one pen can change the world  and proved how one young woman can lead the way.  With her courage and determination  Malala has shown what terrorists fear most:  a girl with a book. Malala is a daughter of the United Nations  from participating in United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) events years ago to marking the 500-day countdown to the Millennium Development Goals with us at United Nations Headquarters this summer.  The United Nations will continue to stand with her against extremism and for the right of girls everywhere to be free of violence  to go to school and to enjoy their right to an education. Kailash Satyarthi has been at the forefront of a worldwide movement for justice  global education and a better life for millions of children trapped in exploitative child labour.  He has been a regular presence at the United Nations  and his leadership  commitment and personal sacrifice over many decades have helped raise public awareness  mobilize opinion leaders  and galvanize society. Thanks in large measure to Mr. Satyarthi’s heroic work  the world has moved from denial about abusive child labour to acknowledgement  awareness and action.  He has successfully brought together the key elements for success in the fight against the worst forms of child labour:  moral outrage  personal commitment  and societal engagement.

2014-10-09,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16243.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s remarks  as prepared for delivery  to the World Bank meeting on post-2015 financing for development in Washington  D.C.  today: It is a pleasure to be with you to discuss the question of financing for the post-2015 sustainable development agenda. The key year of 2015 is fast approaching.  We have three priorities to focus on in the coming months.  First  we must accelerate our efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  This would give us the best possible launching pad for the next generation of goals.  Second  we have to agree on a transformative post-2015 development agenda.  Third  we need to achieve a meaningful universal climate agreement in Paris. Financing will be at the heart of the political agreement Governments have to reach for successfully implementing a sustainable development agenda.  That is why the Third International Conference on Financing for Development  to be held in July 2015 in Addis Ababa  is so important.  The Conference will review the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus and Doha Declaration.  It will also address new challenges and emerging issues. The stakes and expectations are very high.  The outcome of the Conference can be a milestone for the Summit on the post-2015 development agenda in September 2015 — or it can undermine the credibility of the entire enterprise.  Member States must deliver.  There will be several important inputs for the preparation of the Conference. The report of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing is especially important.  It has made three major contributions:  first  it develops an analytical framework.  Second  it proposes a basket of over 115 policy options.  And third  it suggests areas for advancement of the global partnership. The report highlights a number of new elements that the financing framework must take into account  including climate change.  It stresses that while Official Development Assistance remains indispensable  all financing sources — domestic and international  public  private and blended — must be mobilized.  And it goes beyond the Monterrey Consensus to identify both sources and uses of financing  in an effort towards a convergence of the Monterrey and Rio processes  thereby setting the stage for Addis Ababa. Member States  under the auspices of the President of the United Nations General Assembly  are now starting the preparatory process for Addis.  The World Bank is an important partner.  Multilateral development banks have a critical role to play in unlocking private financing through new mechanisms and approaches.  We need your operational expertise in structuring financial instruments that can leverage private resources through public ones to achieve sustainable development. At last month’s Climate Summit  we heard impressive new commitments of public and private finance.  Some $2.3 billion was pledged towards the Green Climate Fund’s initial capitalization.  Representatives of the financial sector announced ambitious initiatives.  Many leaders endorsed the call for putting a price on carbon  thanks to the leadership of the World Bank and the United Nations Global Compact. The Addis Ababa Conference should build on these commitments.  A strong agreement on Financing for Development will lay the groundwork for an ambitious post-2015 agenda and an agreement on climate. We count on your contributions to make the Conference a success.  Multilateral development banks have the expertise and track record with infrastructure and other key investments that are critical for achieving sustainable development.  We look to you to help make the difference between high-level rhetoric and real impact in the lives of the people we serve.  I commend the work done by President [Jim Yong] Kim and I look forward to continue such collaboration in the run-up to the Addis Conference and beyond.

Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks at an event on the Ebola epidemic  in Washington  D.C.  today: The West Africans are scared.  They need our urgent help.  The world fears Ebola too.  That is why we are here.  The best antidote to fear is an effective and urgent response.  We need a 20-fold resource mobilization. We meet today to build on the High-Level Meeting on Ebola that I convened about ten days ago with President [Barack] Obama and other leaders at UN Headquarters. We have five priorities.  First  we must stop the outbreak.  Second  we must treat the infected people.  Third  we must provide essential services.  Fourth  we must preserve stability.  Fifth  we must prevent outbreaks in non-affected countries. I commend the World Bank for approving $400 million in grants and loans for the three affected countries  and the African Development Bank for its swift intervention. I thank the United Kingdom and Sierra Leone for last week’s pledging conference in London.  And I applaud the courage of the many medical and support personnel working to help the people of Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone. The United Nations is providing a system-wide response  through UNMEER [United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response]  with WHO [World Health Organization] at its centre.  Yesterday  I convened a United Nations system-wide meeting  with Dr. Margaret Chan participating  and Dr. David Nabarro and Tony Banbury both participating. Dozens of countries are providing life-saving contributions.  These are the building blocks for a global response coalition. But let me be clear.  Cases are growing exponentially.  We need  as I said  at least a 20-fold surge in assistance — mobile laboratories  vehicles  helicopters  protective equipment  trained medical personnel  and medevac capacities.  We must work together to provide the best standard of care for each individual. Things will get worse before they get better.  How much worse depends on us  the international community.  So for those who have pledged  I say today  please deliver now.  And for those who have yet to pledge  I say  please do so soon.  And I have instructed my UN principal leaders:  Do not wait for a decision.  It’s a matter of action.  I say:  Don’t wait for clearance; we need to act. I think we can beat this disease.

Following is the text of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s video message on the World Day against the Death Penalty  to be observed 9 October: Your Excellency  Mr. Maurizio Enrico Luigi Serra  Permanent Representative of Italy to the United Nations Office in Geneva; Excellencies  distinguished human rights officials  ladies and gentlemen  I thank the European Union and the Italian Government for this commemoration of the World Day against the Death Penalty. Since the General Assembly adopted its first resolution on a moratorium seven years ago  more States acknowledge that the death penalty undermines human dignity.  It fails to deter crimes more than other punishments.  Abolition — or at least a moratorium — contributes to human rights. The taking of life is too irreversible for one person to inflict on another.  We must continue arguing strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights. I urge leaders where the death penalty still is used to legally commute or pardon death sentences  and to impose moratoriums on executions. The death penalty has no place in the twenty-first century.  I call on States that have not yet done so to ratify the Second Optional Protocol of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aiming at abolition of the death penalty. I hope to see many more ratifications during the Protocol’s twenty-fifth anniversary this year.  The United Nations will continue working to end this cruel punishment.

Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s message for the International Day for Disaster Reduction  to be observed on 13 October: As a human family  we are growing older.  Globally  approximately 700 million people — 10 per cent of the world’s population — are over the age of 60  and by 2030  there will be more elderly persons than children for the first time in history.  This year’s commemoration of the International Day for Disaster Reduction is an opportunity to recognize the role of older men and women in fostering resilience. When a natural disaster hits  older persons suffer disproportionately high levels of death and injuries.  This tragic trend must be reversed through plans  services and support that ensure we address the vulnerabilities facing older persons while optimizing their contributions to our collective safety and well-being. Disaster planning must take account of the reduced mobility experienced by many older persons.  We have to enable them to prepare for a potential disaster  reach safety and protect themselves.  The needs of older persons should also be taken into account in early warning systems  social protection mechanisms  evacuation and emergency response plans and public awareness campaigns. At the same time  it is important to recognize that older persons have strengths that can serve the community at large.  Their years of experience can help in reducing risks posed by disasters.  We should involve them in disaster risk management as well as related planning and decision-making processes.  Older persons can also meaningfully enrich our critical global discussions on addressing climate change and achieving sustainable development. On this International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction  let us remind ourselves that building resilience to disasters has no time limit in one’s life — it starts in youth and grows more important as we age.

Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s message on the occasion of the “Music for Peace” event  delivered by Maher Nasser  Acting Head  Department Of Public Information  in New York today: It is a pleasure to convey warm greetings to all those attending what I am sure will be a wonderful “Music for Peace” event.  Music is a hugely powerful  unifying force.  Through their lyrics  many of our greatest songwriters actively promote peace  justice and human rights. I am delighted that the United Nations Academic Impact initiative has teamed up with the Apollo Theater and the World Music Institute to host this gathering devoted to the International Day of Non-Violence.  This annual observance marks the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi  one of history’s greatest-ever proponents of non-violence.  He fervently believed that peaceful protest can accomplish so much more than military aggression.  The principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  adopted in 1948  the year of Gandhi’s death  owe much to his imprint and example. It is 100 years since Mahatma left South Africa to return to India to practice what he preached.  So it is entirely fitting that the United Nations Academic Impact has chosen to celebrate this International Day with young musicians from the country in which he spent his formative years.  Today  at a time of increased sectarian violence and wanton destruction of cultural sites and heritage  particularly in Iraq and Syria  we should recall Gandhi’s warning that  “An eye for an eye ends up making the whole world blind.” On the International Day of Non-Violence  let us recognize that it is up to each and every one of us to foster a culture of peace  built on dialogue  understanding  mutual respect and the peaceful resolution of differences and disputes.

2014-10-09,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16242.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world. Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki—moon’s remarks to the World Bank Conference on Clean Water  Improved Sanitation  and Better Health for Haiti  in Washington  D.C.  today: I would like to thank Dr. Jim Yong Kim of the World Bank  who has organized this very important and timely meeting to support Haiti.  And I would also like to welcome  it is a great pleasure to [have] Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe of Haiti and distinguished ministers from Haiti.  Your participation really means a strong commitment on your part to work with the United Nations  the World Bank and the members of the international community. We are here to express our strong solidarity and our support  our continuing support  for the Haitian people and Government in their fight against cholera  and for social development.  I also appreciate and welcome many partners  countries and organizations for your continuing support. Ladies and gentlemen  for decades  water and sanitation have been neglected in Haiti  with serious consequences for public health.  Without safe water and adequate sanitation  people die from preventable waterborne illnesses  including diarrhoea.  Malnutrition rates worsen  stunting not only a child's development but that of the country itself.  Children  especially girls  stay out of school. We now need to catch up.  We must help the Haitian people.  We must bring access to water  sanitation and health care within reach of every Haitian.  We are here today to help make that happen. The Government is fully mobilized.  Water and sanitation are at the core of Haiti’s National Plan for the Elimination of Cholera.  All United Nations agencies in Haiti will continue to support the Government’s efforts. When I visited Haiti in July  I heard first-hand how cholera has affected families.  My heart ached at the losses that so many thousands of people have had to suffer and die. But I was also moved to see how much communities can do  how resilient people were  and they were really expecting the international community to do more for them.  With a little bit of help  we can help address the underlying risks and make them free of disease.  During my visit  as the Prime Minister said  Prime Minister Lamothe and I launched a Total Sanitation initiative  to raise sanitation standards and improve health conditions for millions of people in the next few years. I have been meeting many people in many different places  but meeting the families of victims was one of my most moving.  And I saw the strong spirit and resilience of those people  and I resolved to myself that there must be more for the international community to do for them. I thank the many donors that have already contributed to the National Plan.  Our challenge is to scale up that support and strengthen Haitian institutions so that implementation is effective and durable. Dr. Paul Farmer and Mr. Pedro Medrano  the UN Senior Coordinator for Resource Mobilization for Haiti Cholera Elimination  have been tracking pledges and disbursements.  As of today  the $2.2 billion  10-year National Plan is just 10 per cent funded.  While a lot has been done  there is clearly much more to do. Haiti has come a long way since the 2010 earthquake.  We are shifting from a context of humanitarian response to one of building institutions and pursuing sustainable development.  More children are in school  and the security situation has improved  although the political process and electoral law remain critical challenges. I call on all of Haiti’s partners to step up  sustain the recent momentum  and help build a healthy Haiti underpinned by clean water and improved sanitation.  Haitians  the Haitian people  expect their Government and the international community to deliver.  If we all do our part  we can help Haitians to realize a healthier  more prosperous future. Thank you for your commitment and leadership.

Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s message on the International Day of the Girl Child  to be observed 11 October: All over the world  an alarming number of adolescent girls are assaulted  beaten  raped  mutilated and even murdered.  The threat of violence at the hands of family members  partners  teachers and peers grossly violates their rights  diminishes their power and suppresses their potential. This violence is exacerbated and reinforced by the multiple deprivations adolescent girls face  including unequal access to education  skills  information  sexual and reproductive health services and social and economic resources.  Girls are subjected to discriminatory social norms and harmful practices — such as female genital mutilation — that perpetuate a cycle of violence.  A culture of impunity allows violence against adolescent girls to continue unabated.  Conflict and humanitarian crises dramatically increase the risk of violence  abuse and exploitation. My UNiTE to End Violence against Women campaign is engaging Governments  international organizations  civil society groups  the media and citizens everywhere to raise awareness and increase political will and resources for preventing and ending violence against women and girls.  A parallel campaign — HeForShe — emphasizes that gender equality is not just a women’s issue by enrolling males to act against all forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls.  As we define the post-2015 development framework and review progress achieved under the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action  ending gender violence and promoting the empowerment of girls and women must be at the heart of our global agenda. To end the cycle of violence against adolescent girls we must go beyond raising awareness and take action to equip girls with knowledge  skills  resources and power to determine their own path in life.  We must provide them with safe transport and access to sources of energy and water  quality health services and supportive environments that will allow them to thrive. On this International Day of the Girl Child  I call on all Governments to take action to end all forms of violence against girls in all parts of the world.  Together  we must create a world where violence against women and girls is never tolerated and girls are always empowered to reach their full potential.

Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s message for World Mental Health Day  to be observed on 10 October: World Mental Health Day is an opportunity for us all to reflect on the challenges faced by people with severe mental health problems and what can be done to make their lives better.  This year  we focus particularly on those living with schizophrenia and the families and friends who help them cope. Around the world  some 21 million people suffer from schizophrenia  a disorder that affects perception  cognition  behaviour and emotions.  In places where health and social services are unable to provide support  schizophrenia and other severe mental disorders can banish people to the borders of society  leaving them unemployed and homeless. People with severe mental illness such as schizophrenia also die on average between 10 and 25 years earlier than the general population.  A key reason is an unhealthy lifestyle  such as smoking  harmful use of alcohol  poor diet and lack of regular exercise.  Yet that can change.  Schizophrenia is treatable.  It does not have to mean a life sentence of isolation and poor physical health.  Appropriate mental and physical health care  along with regular monitoring and psychological and social support  can make a profound difference.  So  too  can the recognition by society at large that people with schizophrenia and other severe mental disorders have equal rights and deserve understanding and assistance. On this World Mental Health Day  I call for health and social care systems to work together to provide opportunities for education  employment and housing.  I encourage health services to expand care in the community and to support the creation of support networks for patients and carers.  And I urge people suffering from schizophrenia to go for regular health checks and seek advice on healthy living.  Together  we can provide dignity and hope to all those suffering from schizophrenia and other severe mental illness.

Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s message on World Habitat Day  to be observed on 6 October: Over the past decade  efforts under the Millennium Development Goals have cut the proportion of people living in slums by more than half.  Yet  over the same period  rapid urbanization  especially in the developing world  has seen overall slum populations rise.  In some parts of sub-Saharan Africa  as many as 70 per cent of urban dwellers live in slums and informal settlements. Slums are often located on the least desirable and appropriate land  such as flood plains and steep hillsides  and are inherently vulnerable to the increasingly severe weather events that climate change is causing.  Many of the people who inhabit slums were pushed to migrate by the lack of opportunities in rural areas or their countries of origin.  They regularly lack basic services such as water  sanitation  electricity and street lighting.  Crime is often endemic  with women and girls particularly at risk.  Unemployment  underemployment and the cost of transport to distant places of work add further hardship. To achieve sustainable development and a life of dignity for all  we must address these issues.  This year  World Habitat Day is devoted to giving a voice to slum dwellers.  Often  people in the slums live in near-anonymity — no address  no census and no idea when their living conditions will improve.  By learning from their experiences  city planners and policymakers can enhance the well-being of a significant portion of the human family.  Let us hear from people who live in slums what has worked and what has not — and what we need to do. On this World Habitat Day  I encourage Governments  businesses  academic institutions and non-governmental organizations to give slum dwellers a voice — and to listen to what they have to say.  We have the technology and the know-how to build economically  socially and environmentally sustainable cities based on local solutions.  Ensuring that our towns and cities expand in a well-planned and managed way is not only necessary to meeting the housing needs of our growing urban population  it is also vital for combating climate change  protecting the environment and supporting sustainable development.  Let us focus on a new urban agenda that leaves no one behind.

2014-10-01,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16227.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.  I am just coming from New York after a hectic two-week general debate session  so please excuse my voice.  My voice has gone down — I’ve almost lost my voice.  But  I am speaking out.  I use my voice to raise human rights  and for poor people and marginalized people. I thank the World Trade Organization for bringing us all together.  It’s a great pleasure for me to be here for a second time.  I was here a few years ago.  As you have been discussing already  international trade is one of the defining activities of our era.  Goods  services and ideas are on the move as never before. Without trade  my country  [the Republic of] Korea could not have risen from the rubble of the Korean war and become a developed country.  Without trade  China could not have achieved the impressive growth that has slashed poverty.  Wherever we look — from Indonesia to Brazil  from Australia to Europe — trade provides a path to accelerated growth and prosperity. History has unfolded along the routes of global trade  from Timbuktu to the Silk Road.  The entrepreneurial drive is clear.  The question is not whether trade matters  but how we can make trade a better driver of equitable  sustainable development.  How can we make trade the foundation of a life of dignity for all? In countries that trade  wealth is made — although that wealth is not always distributed equitably.  But  where trade is absent  economies cannot grow.  They stagnate.  And when trade falters  the most vulnerable are the first to pay the price. That is why we need to promote trade that benefits as many as possible  especially women  young people and the least advantaged.  Many least developed and landlocked developing countries have yet to fully benefit from increased global trade.  We must integrate Africa  least developed and landlocked developing countries into the global economy through open  non-discriminatory and equitable trade.  This is critical to diversifying their economies and making them more stable and resilient. Next year  Governments have three interconnected commitments — three essential deadlines.  This is going to be a very crucial year.  First  we have to accelerate the MDG [Millennium Development Goals] process and meet the targets as much as we can.  Then  Member States should define  shape the future development agenda  what we call the sustainable development goals. And by the end of December next year we must have a universal  legal  climate change agreement in place.  These are three very important responsibilities that Member States and the whole international community must meet. Trade has a major role in this.  International trade is an essential component of an integrated effort to end poverty  ensure food security and promote economic growth.  An ounce of trade can be worth a pound of aid.  That is why Member States working on the sustainable development goals have emphasized the importance of the multilateral trading system. On the other hand  trade can have profoundly negative impacts on the environment  not least in terms of carbon emissions through the production  transport and consumption of traded goods.  Therefore  as part of the sustainable development goals  we must promote policy coherence between the economic  financial and trade systems and environmental sustainability  including the climate change agreement.  Coherence will ensure that trade rules contribute to  rather than detract from  regulations to protect the environment. Trade can — and should — benefit everyone.  That is why the international community needs to avoid protectionism.  We need an open  fair  rules-based and development-oriented international trading regime in the spirit of the Doha Development Round. That means correcting market distortions caused by export subsidies or import tariffs.  It means letting least developed countries benefit from duty-free and quota-free exports.  And it also means addressing countries’ internal impediments to trade  such as lack of productive capacity  excessive red tape or inadequate infrastructure. We must also work to resolve outstanding issues related to the Bali package.  We must focus on a work programme for tackling the remaining core issues in the Doha Development Agenda. Because of the slow progress on a multilateral trade agenda  bilateral  regional and inter-regional free trade agreements have proliferated.  Where these benefit development and free trade  we should welcome them. But  we should also beware creating fragmented trade rules and undermining the consistency of the multilateral system.  That is why the United Nations fully supports the efforts of the WTO to conclude the Doha Round.  This remains the best route to fairer  development-oriented trading systems. Throughout history  trade has joined us and lifted us.  We are now joined as never before.  And living standards have risen for an unprecedented number of people in all regions.  But  we still have a long way to go to fulfil the promise of the Millennium Development Goals.  Sustainable development remains an aspiration.  And climate change is a growing threat.  If managed well  international trade can be a key driver of sustainable development. Let us use the power of trade to improve the well-being of people everywhere while carefully managing the planet’s natural resources and ecosystems.  Let us transform the way we do business by creating an enabling environment for trade and investment that will help deliver sustainable development.  Trade matters to everyone.  Thank you.

2014-10-01,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16226.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.  Good morning.  Thank you for your welcome and invitation.  I am honoured to be the first Secretary-General to address the Executive Committee in almost 10 years. Over the years  UNHCR [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] has been bestowed with the Nobel Peace Prize — not once  but twice.  Today  you are at the centre of action and assistance for tens of millions of people in need. I wish to pay a special tribute to the many humanitarian workers around the world who risk their lives each day to help people in need. The commitment and passion of UNHCR is reflected in the vision and principled leadership of High Commissioner António Guterres.  And I thank the High Commissioner for your decade of delivering for UNHCR and the people it serves.  I really thank you and highly commend your leadership. This is my first trip after a two-week very hectic general debate in the United Nations. For the past two weeks  I have met a succession of world leaders.  We have had many high-level meetings focused on hotspots around the world. The agenda is always full.  The meetings are always rushed.  But  there is perhaps no better place to get a snapshot of the state of the world. I am sorry to tell you  it is not a pretty picture.  We are living in a world of many troubles.  Crises are mounting.  Our planet is warming.  And diseases are spreading. In my annual address to the General Assembly  I highlighted a fact that you know only too well. Never before in United Nations history have we had so many refugees  displaced people and asylum seekers.  Never before has the United Nations been asked to reach so many with emergency food assistance and other life-saving support. Some of the challenges are on the front pages.  Others are far from the headlines.  We are troubled by and suffering from many natural calamities but most of the crises we are seeing are man-made. In Iraq and Syria  we see new depths of barbarity with each passing day  and devastating spillover effects across the region. And as you highlighted this week  the continent of Africa is home to millions of refugees and internally displaced — including more than 2 million people forced to leave their homes this year alone.  This includes people fleeing from war and civil strife from the Central African Republic to northern Nigeria  from the Horn of Africa to the Sahel. I thank the Executive Committee for putting the spotlight on crises that too often remain in the shadows. The world must do more to prevent forced displacement  address its root causes  and support solutions for those affected by it.  This requires greater resources and more political leadership. It also requires unprecedented cooperation by the international community.  I have been pleased to see us pull more closely together through the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Transformative Agenda. Across the landscape of displacement crises  there is a need for an earlier and greater focus on human rights. The “Human Rights Up Front” initiative  which I launched last year  aims to place human rights at the centre of our thinking and our efforts in the field.  UNHCR has been a strong supporter from day one.  It helped craft the action plan and is assisting with implementation worldwide. With its leadership on protection  UNHCR has provided important expertise in the context of humanitarian settings and ongoing conflict situations.  With its culture of protection  UNHCR serves as a model for the wider system. Human Rights Up Front is essentially about an attitude — about speaking up and doing what is right.  The protection of nearly 100 000 people at UN bases throughout South Sudan has been an early milestone of this new approach.  When the crisis happened in South Sudan  tens of thousands of people were rushing into the United Nations compound. You may remember  20 years ago  what that happened and all those people who sought safety in a United Nations mission  we let them go out  we released them from the mission.  As soon as they were released from the United Nations compound they were all murdered  brutally. This time  I gave instructions  in all cases  whoever was coming to the United Nations  bring them and protect them. We have more than 100 000 people.  United Nations missions are not designed  are not equipped to accommodate hundreds of thousands of people.  It’s a huge challenge.  But  without that open gate policy  I’m afraid to tell you that many thousands of people would have died. That is what we call Human Rights Up Front — human rights should be put at the centre and at the front when dealing with refugees and asylum seekers.  Of course  those men  women and children are still there.  We must ensure they remain protected  while at the same time  finding them a durable solution. Securing durable solutions for internally displaced persons and refugees is a joint responsibility and one that needs to be undertaken progressively.  We have learned many lessons in the field.  Now we must use what we have learned to bring together more actors to achieve common commitments.  The new Solutions Alliance is an important platform to do just that. We know that planning for solutions must start early — in fact  during the emergency phase.  After all  unresolved displacement can upend a country’s path to peace and prosperity.  That is why the needs and potential of displaced populations must be reflected in national development plans and based on joint analysis. The displacement challenge also remains an important issue for consideration as Member States of the United Nations continue discussions to formulate the post-2015 development agenda. What I’d like to tell you is that refugees may be a humanitarian issue  it starts as a humanitarian issue  but it has a direct relationship with development issues.  There should be no separation between humanitarian and development — it’s all a part of development issues. I know that your deliberations during this Executive Committee session have also focused on the challenge of statelessness.  Everyone has the right to belong  the right to a nationality.  But  millions worldwide are still denied that right.  I welcome UNHCR’s plans to launch a global campaign to end statelessness in the next decade.  I call on all States to support it. The coming years must be a time for concrete action — for changing nationality laws  resolving the plight of stateless people and ensuring no child is born without citizenship.  Statelessness  like many other human rights violations  is often rooted in discriminatory beliefs and practices.  Let us stand together against all forms of racism  xenophobia and manipulation that engender hatred  exclusion and discrimination.  And let us speak up when people are stripped of their nationality. As we look ahead and prepare for the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 in Istanbul  we must ask how we can ensure the humanitarian system is fit for purpose.  The focus must stay fixed on the people affected by crises and our ability to deliver the protection and relief they need.  We must find ways to be more inclusive of new humanitarian actors.  And we must reaffirm the universality of humanitarian principles which  when respected  protect both the victims and those who come to their rescue.  We simply cannot accept the erosion of these fundamental principles — anywhere  at any time  for any reason. Finally  allow me to share a personal reason why I am so committed to your mission. I understand something about the hardships that refugees and other displaced persons face for a simple reason:  I was one of them  I was myself one of the displaced persons during the Korean war.  When the Korean war ravaged my country as a child  my family had to run for our lives. One of my earliest memories is fleeing with my family into the hills surrounding my village.  As we climbed in the rain and cold  I looked back on the only world I knew.  Where I had played  where I had gone to school  where I had lived with my family — all of it was in flames.  Our lives went up in smoke.  The United Nations and the international community rushed to help.  They nourished us.  They provided textbooks and pens.  They helped us rebuild and gave us the power to hope again. That is why  when I go to refugee camps around the world  I carry a simple message:  “The world is with you  the United Nations is with you  do not despair  I am with you.” I travelled  I visited many refugee camps  Syrian refugee camps  and I was very much humbled to see them:  their life was miserable in refugee camps  but I was encouraged when I saw many children.  They were studying in classrooms  but these classrooms were old  makeshift classrooms  temporary.  I told them that “your situation is better than mine was  60 years ago.  At that time we didn’t have even classrooms  we didn’t have textbooks… but the United Nations is with you.” UNHCR  UNICEF [United Nations Children’s Fund]  UNDP [United Nations Development Programme]  WFP [World Food Programme]  all are now taking care of all these people. Of course  it may be very difficult.  We have 51 million refugees around the world.  We have more than 3 million Syrian refugees.  So  I have been trying to give them a sense of hope.  To all of them  the United Nations is a beacon of hope. As to me  to many Korean children at that time  including myself  the United Nations was the beacon  the beacon of hope.  And despite all these hardships  despite the darkness  I came through.  And I am telling them:  “You will also come through these difficulties  too.  So  do not despair.”  That has been my consistent message to many people in refugee camps  and many developing countries  particularly in Africa.  That is what happens when the world works together.  That is what happens when humanitarian organizations like the UNHCR are on the scene. Once again  ladies and gentlemen  I thank you for this opportunity  for your strong commitment to humanity.  Thank you even more for rebuilding shattered lives and building a better world for all.  Thank you very much for your leadership.

2014-09-29,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16224.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.    Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s message for the International Day of Non-Violence  observed on 2 October: On this International Day of Non-Violence  we commemorate the philosophy of the late Mahatma Gandhi  who through his example proved that peaceful protests could accomplish much more than military aggression. The principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  adopted in 1948  the year of Gandhi’s death  owe much to his beliefs. At this time of increased sectarian violence and the wanton destruction of cultural sites and heritage  it is timely to recall Gandhi’s call for peace and reconciliation  and his warning that  “An eye for an eye ends up making the whole world blind.” We have to foster a culture of peace  built on dialogue and understanding  for living together in harmony while respecting and celebrating humanity’s rich diversity. There is no greater tool than education to enhance human dignity  promote a culture of non-violence  and build lasting peace.  Through education  we can craft new ways of living with each other and the planet.  Education can also lay the foundation for developing new forms of global citizenship and solidarity that are so essential in today’s world. On this Day  I call on all people to counter the forces of intolerance  advance global citizenship and forge human solidarity based on Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of non-violence.

2014-09-28,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16222.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.  Your Excellency President Park Geun-Hye of the Republic of Korea;Honourable Park Han-Chul  President of the Constitutional Court of Korea; Honourable Gianni Buquicchio  President of the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe; Honourable Gagik Harutyunyan  President of the Bureau of World Conference on Constitutional Justice; Excellencies; Ladies and gentlemen: I congratulate the Constitutional Court of Korea for organizing this Congress. Constitutions are a compact between the people and the State.  They create the basis for inclusive societies guided by the rule of law.  They provide a means of securing property rights and improving the equitable use of a country’s resources.  A strong constitutional framework sets constraints on the use of force and serves as a check against the abuse of power. Constitutional courts play a vitally important role in safeguarding this foundation.  They protect rights and deliver justice.  They ensure that public institutions are accountable to the people.  They are central in implementing and reviewing laws that enhance peace and democracy.  Constitutional reform in the aftermath of violent conflict can have a profound impact in addressing root causes and providing peaceful channels for the resolution of disputes. As the international community shapes a post-2015 development agenda and a new set of sustainable development goals  greater attention to the rule of law  institutions and justice will be crucial if we are to succeed in building lives of dignity for all. Thank you for your commitment to strengthening the role of constitutional courts and helping the United Nations advance its global mission of peace  development and human rights.

Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks at a meeting with leaders of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  in New York today: Thank you for coming here today. I saw some of you earlier this month in Samoa.  I wanted to also have the opportunity to meet with you at the outset of the general debate. CARICOM Member States continue to be active on many prominent issues  including climate change  the post-2015 development agenda and financing for development. During his year as General Assembly President  Ambassador John Ashe was a steadfast advocate for UN values and for CARICOM.  And Ambassador Sandra Honoré has provided outstanding service as my Special Representative for Haiti and Head of MINUSTAH [United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti]. I wish to take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to two visionary leaders of the Caribbean who passed away recently. The Honourable Arthur Robinson  former Prime Minister and President of Trinidad and Tobago  played a critical role in the establishment of the International Criminal Court.  Professor Norman Girvan  one of the most distinguished Caribbean scholars of his time  served as my Personal Representative.  Both left an important legacy for the region and the world. I look forward to continuing to hear the voice of the Caribbean. An immediate challenge is how to integrate the particular vulnerabilities of the Caribbean into the post-2015 development agenda  whilst retaining the focus on the remaining MDGs [Millennium Development Goals] as well as the implementation of the Samoa Pathway outcome document. Addressing social development needs and building economic and environmental resilience will be central to the implementation of sustainable development goals in the Caribbean. Your Governments have already taken significant steps to meet the vital challenges ahead  including through the adoption last July of the Strategic Plan for CARICOM over the next five years.

2014-09-27,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16219.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.  I thank all of you for participating in this very timely discussion on the Malian political process. Your participation indicates the importance that peace and stability in Mali has for the region and the world.  I especially welcome His Excellency Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta  President of Mali. I am pleased to welcome representatives of the African Union and ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] who have contributed  since the very beginning  to stabilization efforts in Mali.  I would like to thank them for their close collaboration with MINUSMA [United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali] and my Special Representative.  I would also like to express my appreciation to all the other friends  partners and supporters of Mali present today. We are here together to support the Malian political process because we believe that this process is the cornerstone of stability in that country.  Mali needs peace and stability so that refugees can return home; so that human rights can be protected  and public services restored; so that development can advance and justice and security institutions can be reformed to play their essential role. Yet the security situation in Mali remains extremely fragile. In the north of the country  clashes involving armed groups have continued despite numerous agreements.  I call on these groups to halt all violence and abide by their commitments to resolve their differences through dialogue. At the same time  terrorists have continued their attacks against UN peacekeepers and Malian civilians.  They have fired rockets towards UN camps  laid mines on roads and launched suicide attacks against blue helmets.  They seek to disrupt the political process and prevent the return of normalcy that the north so desperately needs. I strongly condemn these attacks.  I call on all Malian parties to work together to contain these attacks and to bring those responsible to justice.  These attacks will not alter the determination of the United Nations to support the Malian people in their search for peace. Persistent insecurity only underscores the urgency of a negotiated settlement. Fifteen months ago  the Government of Mali and several armed groups signed a preliminary agreement in Ouagadougou that charted the way forward.  Since then  there have been difficult moments.  The fighting in Kidal last May was one of them.  And there have been hopeful occasions  such as the signing of a road map for the talks in Algiers in July. Negotiations are taking place in Algiers as I speak.  Despite an encouraging start  progress has been slow.  I call on all parties to continue engaging with each other in a climate of goodwill and compromise  and to make a serious offer for peace as the Malian population expects and deserves. I wish to reiterate the importance of inclusiveness.  Only a process that is genuinely open to the hopes and concerns of all communities can yield sustainable results. My appreciation goes to the group of mediators  led by Algeria  of which the United Nations  through my Special Representative  Bert Koenders  is an important member. The United Nations stands ready to assist in the implementation of the peace agreement that we all hope can result from the Algiers process.  We will mobilize our expertise on the political  security  development  justice and reconciliation issues that must be part of that agreement.  MINUSMA is ready to play a key role in supporting the implementation of an agreement that is sustainable and inclusive. Mali needs sustained and coherent support from the international community.  We must speak with one voice and we must be persistent during the negotiations  as well as afterwards for the implementation of an agreement. We must also continue working together on a regional basis.  As I noted during my visit to the Sahel region last year  cooperation across regions and institutions is essential to address the [transnational] challenges related to governance  security and resilience.  I count on the continuous leadership of Mali  as Chair of the Coordination Platform for the Sahel  to ensure concerted efforts against instability and fragility in the region.  Through the implementation of the Sahel Strategy  the United Nations looks forward to working with all its partners in a coordinated fashion for the good of the region.

2014-09-26,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16218.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.  Thank you for taking part in this ministerial meeting of the Partnership Group on Myanmar. Since we last met  Myanmar has continued its efforts to implement an ambitious reform agenda which aims to better the lives of all the country’s people. The country has shown progress in many areas of socioeconomic development  national reconciliation and democratization.  Myanmar has been expanding regional and global cooperation.  Myanmar’s current Chairmanship of ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] is one example. Critical hurdles must be overcome as the country prepares for a general election in 2015. The role of Parliament will be crucial as the country takes decisive measures on national reconciliation  engages in political dialogue with its diverse ethnic groups and debates a range of matters  including control of hate speech  as well as a host of other socioeconomic and developmental issues. For the first time in decades  Myanmar will have data to help address key social indicators.  However  some segments of the population were excluded from this vital census  especially in Kachin and Rakhine States.  These issues will need to be addressed in a genuinely inclusive and constructive way in the near future. Inclusive and democratic institutions should serve all  including through the development of an independent judiciary and electoral bodies. Three years ago  President Thein Sein invited ethnic armed groups to join the peace process. The emergence of a single Nationwide Ceasefire Coordination Team and a single draft text of a ceasefire agreement are encouraging developments — as is participation of political parties.  In addition  open discussions on issues like power  resource-sharing and a federal union based on equality  democracy and self-determination are signs of a serious commitment to a united Myanmar. Now is the time to move beyond narrow agendas and towards cooperation. I have been following the developments closely through my Special Adviser  who has regularly attended peace talks.  The United Nations will continue to play a constructive role. I remain deeply troubled by the communal situation in Rakhine and in other parts of the country  the continued polarization between the communities  as well as the possible eruption of conflict between Buddhists and Muslims.  If the underlying causes are left unresolved  the reform process will suffer. Conditions of the vulnerable populations especially in the IDP [internally displaced persons] camps remain precarious and unsustainable.  I highlight the need to address comprehensively the issue of status and citizenship of the Muslim population in Rakhine State —  referred to by the Government as “Bengalis” — but known as Rohingya by that population itself and much of the world. We welcome the latest Memorandum of Understanding between Médicins Sans Frontières and the Government.  We look forward to the early presence of [Médicins Sans Frontières] on the ground.  The various humanitarian agencies and the United Nations must work together to deliver increased development and humanitarian assistance to all sections of the population in an impartial and equitable manner. The Government has taken some positive steps.  Translating recent commitments into visible action will help ease tensions and create the foundation for a long-term equitable solution.  Substantive progress on these measures in the months ahead will be a test of the Government’s ability to deliver.  Meanwhile  the establishment of an OHCHR [Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights] office with a full mandate would help strengthen Myanmar’s commitment on the promotion of human rights. I can assure you that the Government and people of Myanmar will have the full support of the United Nations in pursuit of the goals of democratization and in support of universal international humanitarian and human rights norms. I wish to thank you again for your commitment and support  particularly to the role of my good offices which will continue to play an important role.

Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s message on the International Day of Older Persons  to be observed on 1 October: Older persons are playing an increasingly significant role in society as they grow in number and as health care improves in some parts of the world. The number of older persons is expected to more than double  globally  from 841 million people in 2013 to more than 2 billion in 2050.  By that year  nearly 8 in 10 of the world’s older population will live in the less developed regions. The steady increase in human longevity represents one of the greatest transformations and challenges of our time.  However  failure to keep pace with changing demographic trends will make it difficult to achieve a sustainable  secure and fulfilling future for people of all ages. Older persons make wide-ranging contributions to economic and social development.  However  discrimination and social exclusion persist.  We must overcome this bias in order to ensure a socially and economically active  secure and healthy ageing population. The post-2015 development agenda offers a historic opportunity for the United Nations and its Member States to strengthen the rights and role of older persons in society as an integral part of our commitment to “leave no one behind”. On this International Day  I encourage Governments and people everywhere to ensure the full participation of older persons in society while protecting their rights and dignity.

Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks to the ministerial meeting of the International Support Group for Lebanon  in New York today: Exactly one year after its establishment  and as demonstrated during the successful follow-up meetings held in Paris and Rome  the International Support Group for Lebanon continues to reflect the international community’s shared support for the unity which you  Mr. Prime Minister  have sought to sustain in Government and across the political divide in the face of exceptional challenges. At a turbulent time for the region  Lebanon remains strongly committed to coexistence.  The Lebanese Armed Forces  with the support of UNIFIL [United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]  are contributing to the maintenance of calm across the Blue Line and the implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006).

The Lebanese Army and security forces have performed robustly  but there is an urgent need to increase their capabilities.  I would like to acknowledge the latest pledge by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  and the contributions being made by Member States.  The United Nations will continue to play its part  including through support for the Army’s five-year development plan  the Strategic Dialogue and cooperation in the field of counter-terrorism. Lebanon hosts the highest ratio per capita of refugees in the world.  Over the past year  mechanisms have been put in place to ensure the efficient provision of assistance  including a multi-donor trust fund.  Together we are working on a national response plan to complement the Government’s Road Map for stabilization.  Lebanon  however  has received far less assistance than it needs.  As long as the region is aflame and the war in Syria continues  the rights and safety of refugees in Lebanon must be respected in accordance with international humanitarian norms.  But the strains on Lebanon will remain immense and the burden it is bearing must be shared. This Support Group warmly welcomed the formation of the present broad-based  inclusive Government in Lebanon.  Under your leadership  Mr. Prime Minister  it has wisely continued to pursue the policy of disassociation.  That and the commitments contained in the Baabda Declaration remain essential to limit the impact on Lebanon of the war in Syria. Lebanon’s ability to weather the storm requires the effective functioning of all of the institutions of the State.  It is now four months since President Sleiman’s term ended  and less than two months until Parliament’s term ends.  I urge all of Lebanon’s leaders to engage in dialogue now and make the compromises essential for the election of a President without further delay.  I hope this Group and other key friends of Lebanon will echo this message. I am grateful to the participants in the International Support Group for its assistance.  The international unity which this Group has demonstrated will remain crucial for Lebanon and the region.  I hope Lebanon’s leaders will draw strength from the Group’s support to make the important decisions needed for the sake of the country and its people. Thank you for your leadership.

2014-09-26,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16215.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.    Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s remarks to the high-level meeting on the Central African Republic  in New York today: Thank you for joining forces to focus on the situation in the Central African Republic (CAR). I extend a special welcome to the Head of State of the Transition  Ms. Catherine Samba-Panza.  I thank Mediator of the CAR crisis — President Denis Sassou Nguesso of the Republic of Congo.  I also appreciate the presence of many other Heads of State and Government  the representative of the African Union  the Secretary-General of the Economic Community of Central African States  representatives of members of the Security Council  and other key partners  including the World Bank. Allow me to also pay tribute to the memory of Ms. Margaret Vogt  my former Special Representative  who passed away this week.  She cared deeply for the people of the Central African Republic — and was admired and respected by all who knew her. One year ago  the Central African Republic plunged into crisis.  Brutal sectarian strife  humanitarian suffering and atrocity crimes followed. I visited the Central African Republic in April.  I will never forget the utter devastation and desperation. There has also been some important progress since then. I salute the African-led peacekeeping operation  MISCA [African-led International Support Mission in the Central African Republic] and the French forces under Operation Sangaris. On 15 September  MISCA transferred authority to MINUSCA [United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic] — a tribute to the good collaboration between the United Nations and the African Union.  MINUSCA  along with the French forces and EUFOR-RCA [European Union-led peacekeeping force-Central African Republic]  will seek to build on the relative security improvements. The political process has been strengthened following the election of Ms. Samba-Panza in January.  The cessation of hostilities agreement signed in Brazzaville on 23 July is an important step.  Full implementation is critical — so  too  is an inclusive  broad-based dialogue  supported by regional and international partners.  I encourage all parties to quickly reach a political agreement on governance and key rule of law issues.  Accountability for horrendous crimes is central to peace. There is much work ahead.  Many thousands of people remain displaced.  Women and children remain exposed to extreme violence and abuse.  Thousands of children are still linked with armed groups.  We are still far from reconciliation between different communities.  A food security crisis looms.  We must mobilize to support economic recovery and stabilization to meet urgent security and humanitarian needs. For decades  the architecture of the State has been hollowed out by mismanagement  corruption and international neglect.  Rebuilding will take time  but we need to focus now on strengthening public financial management and accountability specifically targeting revenue collection  expenditure controls  public procurement and concession practices. The partnership between the international community and the Central African Republic must be rooted in mutual accountability. During my visit to the country  a leader of a woman’s peace group said:  “Our social fabric is in shreds.  The bonds of our community have broken.  There is nothing to connect us.  But you represent the world and you are here.  Now we know we are a part of the world.” Before I conclude  I would like to also thank President [Idriss] Deby of Chad for his leadership  and I am taking this opportunity [to pay tribute] for the many losses of brave  young men and women Chad lost.  I wish them all the best.  We work for peace in their honour. We must be there for the people of the CAR.  Let us pledge to stay the course and help them chart a path to reconstruction  reconciliation  and the rule of law. We have an opportunity to help — and an obligation to act. Thank you very much for your commitment.

Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks  as prepared for delivery  at the event marking the fortieth anniversary of Bangladesh’s membership of the United Nations  in New York today: I am delighted to join you in celebrating the fortieth anniversary of Bangladesh’s membership in the United Nations. Allow me to offer a personal recollection.  In 1973  as a Foreign Service officer posted in New Delhi  I was part of the team that was responsible for establishing my country’s diplomatic ties with Bangladesh.  When I visited for the first time  I was deeply humbled by what I saw  because your country reminded me so much of mine at the end of the Korean War.  There were so many shortages I had to tear small strips of paper for my counterpart at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for him to be able to write me a memo! At the same time  despite the poverty  destruction and human misery there was a burning determination to build a new country.  I have made many visits since.  Each time  I have been struck by the enormous progress that has been made. Bangladesh has built a thriving economy and made important gains towards the Millennium Development Goals.  The frugality and common purpose I witnessed 40 years ago have been driving forces in this great success.  I particularly commend the work that Bangladesh has accomplished in disaster risk reduction at a time of climate change.  And of course  Bangladesh is one of the top contributors to United Nations peacekeeping. I am pleased that the dream of “Shonar Bangla” [Golden Bengal] that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had for his country is steadily becoming a reality.  It is a special pleasure to congratulate Bangladesh and its people for their achievements and its efforts as a dynamic United Nations Member State.  The United Nations and I look forward to deepening this relationship in our shared pursuit of peace  development and human rights for all.  Thank you.

Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s remarks at the seventh ministerial meeting of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  in New York  today: Thank you all for coming to this important meeting.  I am especially grateful to see representatives of countries which have not yet ratified the Treaty.   Throughout my diplomatic career  I have pushed for an end to nuclear tests.  As Secretary-General  I have consistently advocated universal ratification of the CTBT. This treaty bans all nuclear tests  constrains the development and proliferation of nuclear weapons  and contributes to progress on nuclear disarmament.  The CTBT also helps protect our environment against harmful radioactive by-products of nuclear tests. But we must secure the ratifications necessary for entry into force.  I call for urgent ratification by the eight remaining Annex II States.  I look forward to hearing soon from John Kerry  Secretary of State of the United States — an advocate against nuclear tests. I thank the Governments of Australia and Japan for taking the lead in organizing today’s meeting.  I also commend the many non-governmental organizations  civil society groups and individuals who have made efforts to support our goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world.  The United Nations stands with them in this historic struggle. Earlier this month  I visited the Pacific region.  I went to countries that were not directly affected by nuclear tests  but flying over the ocean I recalled the injustice of how innocent people in tranquil islands were exposed to harmful radiation.  We cannot undo the past. But we can create a better future. Let me just make a personal observation  reflection:  I served as the second Chairperson of this CTBT Preparatory Committee while serving as Korean Ambassador in Vienna.  That was just after the signature of the CTBT.  When I chaired this committee  I made a joke.  My name is Ban; this can be read “ban”  so I told delegations that I will not ban constructive discussions in the committee meetings but I will ban the nuclear test.  Everybody laughed.  That was my commitment  using my name.  I will continue to ban nuclear tests.  That is why I have never missed this meeting in the United Nations.  This is my eighth time as Secretary-General to participate in this meeting.  So let us ban nuclear tests.  And let us do everything possible to secure this Treaty’s entry into force for the sake of our planet and all living beings.

2014-09-26,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16212.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.  Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks at the Summit on United Nations Peacekeeping  in New York today: I thank the United States Government and in particular Vice-President [Joe] Biden and Ambassador [Samantha] Power for convening this Summit meeting. Throughout this week  we have heard countless voices sounding the alarm over flaring tensions and violence in different parts of the world.  This Summit is an important occasion to strengthen our resolve to stand up for peace. The global security landscape is shifting dramatically.  Civil conflicts coupled with terrorism  organized crime and health crises  such as Ebola are threatening millions of people.  More often than not  these dangers transcend borders. United Nations peacekeeping missions are a leading part of the international response to a wide array of threats.  More than 130 000 troops  police and civilian staff are now deployed — that is a UN record.  But  even beyond these numbers  peacekeeping is being called on to do more than ever  from security sector reform and disarmament to a range of peacebuilding and stabilization tasks.  Let us not forget that peacekeepers are also peacebuilders. The risks are also growing.  From northern Mali to the Golan Heights  peacekeepers work in environments where they themselves are subject to attack.  I thank the troop-contributing countries for their strong commitment to world peace and security.  We are very proud of the many women and men who are working so hard under difficult and often dangerous circumstances. Without wide-ranging and tangible support from Member States  peacekeeping missions cannot deploy quickly  operate safely and nimbly  or protect civilians across massive spaces and difficult terrain. That is why I welcome the focus of this meeting on the capabilities that Member States can provide.  Six critical necessities stand out at this time:  first  rapid response  including troops and the ability to get them to the right place at the right time; second  greater mobility  above all through helicopters; third  strengthened medical support; fourth  better protection against improvised explosive devices  IEDs; fifth  improved information and analysis  including expertise on organized crime; sixth  strong partnerships with regional organizations  particularly in Africa  where many UN peacekeeping operations are deployed alongside African Union and  in some cases  European Union missions.  The recent launch of the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership by the United States and six other countries holds great promise. Each nation must consider what it can bring to the peacekeeping endeavour.  For some  it has been military and police personnel.  I welcome the announcement two days ago by His Excellency President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico that his country intends to participate in UN peacekeeping missions.  As you may know  Mexico has had some constitutional difficulties  therefore  they have not been participating.  For the first time they are now participating. Other countries may possess unique expertise  scarce equipment or financial resources.  What our missions need from all of you is sustained political and diplomatic backing. I recognize that the UN Secretariat must also do its part to continually improve this vital instrument. It has been 15 years since the last comprehensive review of United Nations peace operations. The time has come to take stock of the great strides that have been made  the lessons we have learned  and the new contexts in which our missions are deployed. The world is changing and our support to peacekeeping  and indeed  all peace operations  must keep pace. Increasingly  missions are being deployed where there is no peace to keep  and no peace agreement to defend  where grave abuses are being committed against civilians.  With so much at stake  divisions among the Security Council and wider UN membership can carry a high price.  We must fortify the spirit of collective responsibility that lies at the heart of UN peacekeeping. We must ask ourselves what we want from peacekeeping  and what it needs to succeed.  To help us find answers  I have decided to appoint a high-level panel to undertake a review of UN peace operations — peacekeeping and political missions.  We also plan to follow up on this Summit by convening a meeting of Military Chiefs of Staff in the months ahead.  I look forward to your contributions to both of these exercises. International peace operations are an expression of the resolve of the Security Council.  They draw on the input of the whole membership of the United Nations.   They are your missions  and you should do your very best to enable them to succeed for world peace and security.  Thank you very much for your commitment.

2014-09-26,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16211.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.  Thank you for this opportunity to address you.  I commend Foreign Minister Choquehuanca as well as Ambassador Llorentty Solíz for Bolivia’s strong leadership of the Group of 77 and China this year. I was impressed by the success of this Group’s momentous fiftieth anniversary Summit in Santa Cruz this June  and I highly commend the leadership of President Evo Morales [Ayma of Bolivia] as Chair of this important meeting. The G77 and China have a proud history of advocating for development that is fair  lasting and equitable.  With your support and encouragement  the world has adopted important action plans  including for the Millennium Development Goals.  I am confident that the G77 will build on this valuable tradition and use its powerful voice to influence the current discussions on a new and transformative universal development agenda. I agree with the Group that the post-2015 development agenda must finish the work of the Millennium Development Goals.  Their human development imperatives  including the eradication of poverty  must remain at the heart of the post-2015 development agenda. The Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals has built on the Millennium Development Goals to articulate a much broader agenda  one that is universal  inclusive and responsive to the key global challenges. Our new agenda will have many components that are central to the concerns of people living in G77 countries and China.  It will have sustainable development at its core and poverty eradication as its most urgent priority.  Our new agenda will address basic needs such as energy  infrastructure  equality  justice  inclusive growth  economic transformation  food  education  health care and decent employment.  The new agenda will address how people live in cities  what we produce and consume and how we use our ecosystems.  And it will highlight the link between development and peaceful and inclusive societies. To be more than words on paper  the agenda will need financial and other means for its effective implementation.  Official development assistance (ODA) is a necessary but not a sufficient element of the entire financing picture.  We will need all resources:  public and private  domestic and international.  And we will need to boost cooperation on technology. I commend the results of the Expert Committee on Sustainable Development Financing.  I also look forward to the results of the follow-up Conference on Financing for Development.  I count on the G77 and China to actively advocate for progress on this issue. Just a few days ago  I engaged global leaders at the Climate Summit to catalyse ambitious action on the ground.  Climate change remains a defining issue of our times.  Addressing it is a key part of sustainable development.  We will not be able to deliver on the ambitions of the new development agenda without tackling the climate challenge.  I am heartened by the outcome of the Climate Summit.  I urge Member States of the Group to help me in generating positive momentum for the Conference of the Parties in Peru this year and in Paris in 2015. Transformation is our goal.  Ending poverty and transforming our societies and economies to meet fundamental human needs is an essential step towards achieving planetary sustainability.  We need to work in partnership on these mutually reinforcing goals.  The United Nations will do everything possible to strengthen the global partnership for development. I count on your support for His Excellency President Sam Kahamba Kutesa  as we join forces to lay the foundations for the adoption next year of a post-2015 development agenda that ensures a life of dignity for all.

Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s remarks  as prepared for delivery  at the meeting with Pacific Island Forum Leaders  in New York today: I am pleased to welcome you to the United Nations.  I congratulate Palau on its chairmanship of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF)  and I applaud Tuiloma Nerona Slade for his years of leadership as PIF Secretary-General. Today we build on the successful Forum Leaders’ meeting in Koror last month.  I congratulate you on the adoption of the Palau Declaration on “The Ocean:  Life and Future — charting a course to sustainability”. I fully support the Declaration’s recognition that leaders of the Pacific are stewards of the Pacific Ocean  one of the world’s greatest endowments.  I commend your strong position on the importance of having a comprehensive stand-alone sustainable development goal on oceans. I congratulate the Pacific Islands Forum for the launch of the Pacific Ocean Alliance.  The United Nations system will support this initiative.  I encourage you to take advantage of our technical assistance to developing States. I was recently in your beautiful region for the Third [International] Conference on Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in Apia  Samoa.  I also visited New Zealand  which contributed a great deal to the success of the SIDS Conference. While I was in Samoa  I visited a community that was displaced by a tsunami in 2009.  It was a stark reminder of the effects of climate change.  At the same time  I was impressed by the energy and determination of the peoples of the Pacific to confront and overcome our pressing challenges. I welcome your active participation at the SIDS Conference — the largest international gathering ever held in the Pacific.  I was deeply encouraged by the more than 300 partnerships established there with civil and business communities. The pledges made in Apia ranged across economic  social and environmental initiatives. The Samoa Pathway should be high on the agenda of the General Assembly  ECOSOC [Economic and Social Council] and the High-level Political Forum.  UN regional commissions are fully engaged in carrying out its provisions. In Apia  I instructed leaders from across the United Nations to work as one team to reflect the decisions and recommendations of the SIDS Conference.  I reinforced this instruction to senior managers as soon as I returned to New York. The Conference outcome also made an important and strong reference to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.  This echoes the consistent recognition by Member States of the Convention’s contribution to the sustainable development of oceans and their resources. This week  we held a historic Climate Summit that brought together an unprecedented gathering of high-level representatives of Governments  civil society  the private sector and activists.  I applaud all Pacific countries that raised their strong voices for progress on the climate negotiations. I am doing everything possible to press for the adoption of a meaningful  legal climate agreement next year.  I am also urging Governments to capitalize the Green Climate Fund so it can help finance activities related to climate mitigation and adaptation. At the same time  we are intensifying our push to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.  And we are shaping a post-2015 development agenda and sustainable development goals that address the vulnerabilities and needs of all countries  including the small island developing States. The PIF can help drive global progress on all three fronts.  And that will help secure our collective future.  The Pacific region continues to be a dynamic region.  The United Nations welcomes the increased contribution of Pacific countries to UN priorities.  Our partnership with you remains strong on peace  democratic transitions and peacebuilding. I recently welcomed the peaceful elections in Fiji.  I applaud the Fijian people for exercising their constitutional right to vote.  I hope this election will advance Fiji’s transition to democracy.  The United Nations fully supports this goal. In Papua New Guinea  we are committed to working in close partnership with the Government of Papua New Guinea and the Autonomous Bougainville Government in support of ongoing peacebuilding efforts.  The UN Peacebuilding Fund will back this process.  Maintaining peace and security and upholding human rights and the rule of law are essential to lasting progress in the Pacific region. Empowering women is critical to progress.  I have noted the adoption of the Pacific Leaders Gender Equality Declaration and the Pacific Regional Action Plan on Women  Peace and Security.  I encourage you to boost the political participation and economic advancement of women  and to eliminate violence against them. The United Nations is committed to a strong partnership with this Forum.  And we count on its support for our global work at this critical point in history.  We have a once-in-a-generation chance to put the world on a sustainable path.  I count on the Pacific to be in the vanguard of this historic drive for a better future.  Thank you.

Your Excellency John Kerry  Secretary of State of the United States; Your Excellency Héctor Marcos Timerman  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Argentina; Your Excellency Frans Timmermans  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands; Honourable Ministers  distinguished delegates  dear friends  Welcome to the United Nations.  I thank all of the leaders of this valuable initiative.  I wanted to co-host this meaningful gathering  but I could not because of a scheduling conflict.  Please know that I send my full solidarity to all of our friends gathered here today. I strongly support equal rights for lesbian  gay  bisexual  transgender and intersex people everywhere.  I speak out against the appallingly high levels of stigma  discrimination and violence people suffer because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The fight for human rights  and the fight against discrimination  lies at the core of the mission of the United Nations.  I am proud that this year we took another step towards eliminating discrimination within the UN with measures that ensure fairer treatment of gay and lesbian UN staff and their families. But  the fight for equal rights demands global engagement.  That is why the United Nations actively works to tackle homophobia and transphobia around the world.  We are joining forces with Governments and activists to support changes in discriminatory laws.  Our Free and Equal campaign is opening people’s hearts and minds. It may be tough  but that will never stop us from pressing ahead.  We cannot back off from human rights protection just because Governments differ on certain issues.  We are not here to tackle only easy matters  or to discuss only what everyone agrees on already.  We are here to protect the rights of all people  everywhere. I deeply appreciate the LGBT Core Group for raising the profile of this issue at the United Nations.  Thanks in part to your efforts  awareness is growing and so is support for action. I say to all people:  raise your voices.  Ending homophobia and transphobia is a great human rights cause.  It brings together millions of people of all different ages  nationalities and backgrounds. Together  we can — and we will — make a safe  fair and just world for everyone  no matter who they are or whom they love.

2014-09-25,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16207.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.  Thank you for joining me today.  Women’s and children’s health has always been a top priority for me.  I have seen in my country  my family and in my travels how much women and children suffer without proper health care.  I  myself  was born without help of a midwife; just some senior  older women — grandmothers — must have helped my mother. Four years since we launched “Every w oman  every child”  it has grown to include over 300 partners.  Many of our top leaders are here in this room today.  Thanks to their invaluable commitment and leadership  especially from the “H4+” agencies  the world is reducing deaths of children under the age of five faster than at any time in the past two decades.  Each day  some 17 000 more children survive.  Deaths of mothers have been cut by almost half since 1990. These are impressive numbers in conference rooms in New York.  They are even more meaningful in hospitals  health posts and homes.  In today’s troubled world  our progress in this area shines brightly.  It demonstrates what can be achieved when we come together as a community in partnership. As we advance  we will have to protect these fragile gains and cope with emerging challenges.  Climate change  water  education  sanitation  nutrition and human rights all affect women and children’s health.  We have to rise to problems  such as non-communicable diseases and Ebola.  And  we must seek out new ways to reach our goals. Under the groundbreaking “Every woman  every child” partnership model  we are finding new  creative solutions and expanding new partnerships that are saving lives.  Over the next year  we must redouble our efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals while shaping a vision for the future development agenda. That is why I have proposed that the General Assembly adopt a resolution this fall establishing a partnership facility.  We need to strengthen the UN’s capacity to form broad coalitions of partners and hit the ground running to implement the new development framework. For the first time ever  we have the opportunity to end all preventable deaths of women and children within a generation.  Let us seize this historic opportunity as a moral imperative.  It is also one of the smartest investments we can make. In 2030  when we look back on our progress on meeting the Sustainable Development Goals  a key measure of our success will be the health and well-being of women  children and adolescents everywhere.  This success depends on us all working together.  “Every woman  every child” will help get us there. I call on all of you to renew your commitments  boost financing  keep insisting on accountability for resources and results  and reach every woman and every child.  Together  we can make history.

2014-09-25,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16206.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.  I am pleased to send greetings to the “Delivering Zero Hunger – Demonstrating Impact” high-level event.  I applaud your work to achieve a world without hunger. I issued my Zero Hunger Challenge because I know that it is possible to end hunger in our lifetimes.  Our vision is a world where childhood under-nutrition is eliminated through sustainable and climate-smart agriculture that benefits smallholders  where there is no loss or waste in food systems  and where all people have year-round access to nutritious foods. We are making progress.  Hunger is declining.  The latest report on the State of Food Insecurity indicates that 63 countries have already reached the Millennium Development Goal target to halve hunger.  Globally  the goal is within reach.  However  one in nine people still struggle with hunger every day.  A rising population and changing climate  coupled with conflicts and health crises  make our task more urgent. Zero Hunger cannot be achieved by acting alone.  Food security is everyone’s business  so all need to be engaged in this effort.  Sustained political commitment to this vision  as well as effective partnership among Governments  business  civil society and research bodies  are essential to realize our goal. I welcome the commitments made at the Climate Summit  including the launch of the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture.  We need to do everything we can to support the world’s 500 million smallholder farmers  strengthen their resilience and increase productivity.  We can find ways to achieve these aims. You have come together today to share how you are delivering Zero Hunger with practical actions.  The examples you share and the pledges you make will help ensure that every woman  man and child realizes their right to food. We have seen how bold commitments  sustained political will and effective multi-stakeholder partnerships can combine to make a real and lasting difference.  The time for action is now.  We are accountable to 805 million hungry people.  We can keep our promise to Deliver Zero Hunger.  I wish you success at today’s meeting and in the important work ahead.

2014-09-25,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16205.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.  Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s remarks to the high-level meeting on Hope for South Sudan  in New York today: Nine months ago  conflict started in South Sudan.  Tens of thousands have been killed.  Nearly 2 million people have fled their homes.  Nearly half a million have crossed borders into neighbouring countries. I saw the conditions first hand when I visited in May.  I was appalled by the humanitarian situation.  Almost a hundred thousand people are sheltering at United Nations peacekeeping bases.  Without the UN’s protection  thousands would probably have died. Outside UN bases  hundreds of thousands of displaced people live in insecurity and lack the basics to survive.  Humanitarian agencies face enormous problems in reaching them. Around 4 million people — more than a third of the entire country — suffer alarming food insecurity.  Unless we act quickly  some 50 000 children could die before the end of this year. South Sudan has fertile land and valuable reserves of oil.  It has a potentially vibrant economy.  But  instead of thriving  the country is failing. The dire humanitarian situation is primarily man-made.  I have told the parties there is no military solution to the conflict.  The international community must remain committed to impose punitive measures on those responsible for the violence and impeding the peace process. I call today  once again  on the leadership of both sides to find an inclusive and mutually agreed power-sharing arrangement to start a transitional phase of governance.  An agreement leaving key stakeholders outside the transition will not bring sustainable peace.  It cannot be imposed. A peace agreement will also have to address convincingly the causes of the conflict  in particular  transparency and accountability in the management of oil resources  which must be used to improve the welfare of the majority and not to benefit a minority. Those responsible for atrocities must face justice through a mechanism that meets international standards.  There can be no amnesty for anyone responsible for killing innocent civilians.  The leaders must protect civilians  allow humanitarian access and guarantee the safety of aid operations. The international community must intensify its support for South Sudan.  I commend the troop-contributing countries.  I thank all the donors.  But  we must do more to meet the enormous needs. The United Nations is supporting the people of South Sudan with the biggest humanitarian operation ever undertaken in a country.   Reinforcements of 5 000 peacekeepers are being deployed.  We are supporting the IGAD [Intergovernmental Authority on Development] peace process. I have a message for the leaders of South Sudan:  You opened the wounds that have caused so much suffering.  Now heal them. The parties owe this to their people and future generations.  Thank you for your leadership and commitment.

2014-09-25,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16204.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.  We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity before us.  Next year  2015  will mark the culmination of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  We will define a successor framework in the name of Sustainable Development Goals.  And leaders have agreed to finalize a new global climate pact by the end of next year.  So  2015 has all three important priorities which we have to achieve. These are ambitious goals  but they are doable — they are achievable — if we are united.  The energy and commitment you are showing today should continue.  If this continues and generates and keeps up this momentum  I think we can do it. The MDGs have proven that  when we work together  transformational change is possible.  Member States came together and turned noble principles and high aspirations into a set of time-bound common goals and targets for development. Over the last 14 years  countries have made tremendous headway in reducing poverty and disease  improving access to education and water  and moving the world closer to gender equality.  Of course  we have much work ahead — and new challenges have emerged.  Now  we must stay committed to the MDGs until the finish line. If I may say it this way  you see many marathoners.  They have a long  long distance [to run].  Some people go first; some people go behind; but the most important thing [is that the one who] gets the medal is the one who makes the last spurt  just a hundred metres. We have less than 500 days.  As of today  we have 463 days  already half a day has passed  so maybe 462.  The clock is ticking  so we have to work hard and we have much work ahead  the last spurt.  I really count on you.  Now  we must stay committed to the MDGs until we achieve them. We must learn from both success and failure.  The post-2015 development agenda presents the chance to recalibrate our efforts.  Member States are now shaping the new sustainable development agenda.  But  that cannot be left only to negotiations in these halls. The new framework has to connect with people.  That is why  for the last two years  the United Nations has spearheaded an unprecedented global conversation on the world we want.  As of today  over 5 million people have made their voices heard  in face to face meetings and in the “MY World” survey. We have made special efforts to engage the excluded and marginalized and vulnerable  those that remain hungry.  I thank the Governments  civil society organizations  businesses  experts and thousands of volunteers who are making this effort possible. We have found that people want to be involved in shaping the new development agenda.  In fact the United Nations under the leadership of UNDP’s [United Nations Development Programme’s] Helen Clark  and also DESA [Department of Economic and Social Affairs]  we have had the United Nations system-wide assessment and consultation.  We have reached out to civil society.  As I said  5 million people responded that  “this is the world which I want”. We have been collecting all these views of young people  particularly women and girls and marginalized groups of people.  This is a sort of global vision  a shared global vision.  Implementation needs to be inclusive.  People want to be a part of delivering this new agenda and holding Governments to their promises. The quantum leaps necessary for the success of the sustainable development goals will come from broad partnerships to galvanize political will  fill financial gaps and add value through diverse coalitions.  Let us draw inspiration from these vibrant discussions and keep up the momentum. That is why  as we work to advance the negotiations  the UN system will continue to bring the voices of the people to the table.  We will support nationally driven efforts to prioritize and shape the sustainable development agenda at country level. Let us make the most of this historic  generational opportunity to move the sustainable development agenda forward.  Together  we can identify practical means to realize our goals and people’s dreams.  Thank you for your passion and commitment.

2014-09-25,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16203.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.  I thank Alpha Condé  President of Guinea  for joining us in person.  I also welcome Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf  President of Liberia and Ernest Bai Koroma  President of Sierra Leone  who are participating by video teleconference link  and are now observing the proceedings.  President Johnson-Sirleaf and President Koroma will shortly deliver their statements from the screens on either side of this podium.  Thank you for your participation and leadership. We come together today in solidarity with the people of Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone as they face the largest and most deadly Ebola outbreak the world has ever seen. Ebola is raging.  It kills more than 200 people a day  two thirds of them women.  Despite the valiant efforts of local communities  health systems are buckling under the strain. Many have tried to shut out the virus by closing their borders.  Several airlines have stopped serving the three countries.  The number of ships docking at their ports has dwindled.  But  such an approach only makes the situation worse  isolating countries when they need help most. There is some encouraging news to report.  In some treatment centres  patients are receiving the care they need.  In several locations  community-based programmes are yielding promising results. I want to pay special tribute to the health workers on the frontlines.  More than 300 have died after being exposed to the virus. At great personal risk  numerous national  regional and international organizations  civil society groups and non-governmental organizations  such as the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent and Médecins sans Frontières  are making vital contributions  providing safe burials and providing patients with dignified care. The Presidents of Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone have asked for our help.  The United Nations has outlined the critical resources that are needed. Dozens of countries and organizations  too many to mention by name  are making life-saving contributions  and I thank all of them for their generous support.  But  even these are falling significantly short of the 20-fold surge that is required. There is overwhelming international political momentum for the United Nations to play a leading role in coordinating the response.  We will play this role and meet this challenge. United Nations staff are eager to help.  Within 24 hours of a call for staff to deploy  we received 4 000 applications.  Some staff are preparing to depart over the weekend. The entire United Nations system is mobilized  including the World Health Organization (WHO)  under the leadership of Dr. Margaret Chan  and the World Bank  under the leadership of President Jim Yong Kim.  The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Liberia  as well as all agencies  funds and programmes in the affected region  have been providing assistance for months. The United Nations response will be spearheaded by the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response  or UNMEER  which will be led by my Special Representative  Anthony Banbury. UNMEER advance teams have deployed to the mission headquarters in Ghana and to the three most-affected countries.  One core responsibility will be to support prevention efforts throughout the region.  Dr. David Nabarro will continue to provide strategic guidance as my Special Envoy and as part of a Global Ebola Response Coalition. Working with Governments  communities and the full spectrum of international partners  we are focusing on stopping the outbreak  treating the infected  providing essential services  preserving stability and preventing outbreaks in non-affected countries.  These five priorities spell out the word “STEPP”.  Today  it is time for the international community to step up — and help Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone continue on the path of development and stability. This crisis has highlighted the need to strengthen early identification systems and early action.  We should consider whether the world needs a stand-by corps of medical professionals  backed by the expertise of WHO and the logistical capacity of the United Nations.  Just as our troops in blue helmets help keep people safe  a corps in white coats could help keep people healthy. Now is the time for a robust and united effort to stop the outbreak.  The world can and must stop Ebola — now.  Thank you very much for your commitment.

2014-09-25,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16202.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.  Libya is in deep crisis.  The past months have seen unprecedented violence between rival armed formations.  More than 300 000 people are displaced.  Airports  government buildings and other vital infrastructure have been destroyed.  Hospitals are suffering from acute shortages of medical supplies. The political transition process is facing its biggest challenge since the revolution.  The legitimately elected legislature  the House of Representatives  has been forced to base itself in Tobruk  and a number of its members have boycotted its proceedings.  The country is increasingly divided.  Violence and intimidation is rampant. We must do our utmost to reverse this course and help the Libyan people safeguard their democratic transition. The crisis is also threatening the region and beyond through illegal weapons flows and increasing pockets of lawlessness and extremism. Time is of the essence.  Our collective approach should be anchored in the principles of non-interference in Libya’s internal affairs and respect for its national sovereignty. There is no space for violence in the political transition process.  Concerns must be addressed through inclusive political dialogue  including with those in Tobruk  Misrata  Tripoli  Benghazi and elsewhere. This will form the basis for the parties’ agreement to disarm and integrate into the State’s military forces.  We must also be clear that terrorists cannot have a seat at the table. The challenges facing Libya are compounded by the fact that most international missions  including the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH)  have had to temporarily evacuate from the country.  Nevertheless  Special Representative Bernardino León continues to shuttle between the parties in Libya to promote dialogue as the only way out of the crisis.  I commend his leadership. Your presence today sends a strong signal of engagement and assistance.  We need to reinforce commitments  including those made at the conference in Rome in March 2014.  Such support depends on Libyan political will to reject violence  engage in an inclusive political process and make the difficult  but necessary  compromises.  These compromises will have to begin immediately  with a complete ceasefire and an agreement to find peace. Special Representative León has been working in this direction — and I am encouraged by the positive response of the parties to his initiative to facilitate dialogue between them on 29 September. I hope that the Libyans will seize this opportunity to find a suitable solution to the conflict.  Special Representative León has my full support and confidence and he will need yours  too.  When I visited Libya in 2011  I saw the courage and determination of its people for a better future.  That is the same spirit that Libyans took to the polls in July 2012 in the first democratic elections in more than four decades. Only through unity can Libyans hope to build a country that responds to the calls for freedom and honours those who sacrificed so much. Let us work to encourage all parties to forge consensus in a spirit of inclusivity and reconciliation.  Thank you for your leadership and commitment.

2014-09-25,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16201.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.  Today marks a milestone in the history of the Arms Trade Treaty.  Less than two years after its adoption by the General Assembly  we have crossed the threshold of 50 ratifications needed to trigger the Treaty’s entry into force.  This will occur on 24 December. I commend the Governments of the Bahamas  Portugal  Saint Lucia  Senegal and Uruguay for depositing their instruments of ratification today.  I also salute the many civil society organizations that have helped make this speedy progress possible. The need for the Arms Trade Treaty remains abundantly clear.  Deadly weaponry continues to find its way into irresponsible hands.  Unscrupulous arms brokers defy United Nations arms embargoes.  Ruthless leaders turn their arsenals on their own citizens.  Ammunition depots are poorly guarded.  State-owned weapons go missing.  Civilian airplanes end up in the crosshairs.  End-use certificates are not standardized and can be easily forged.  Pirates wield grenade launchers and machine guns against merchant ships.  Drug traffickers outgun police forces. Just as with other commodities  the trade in arms should comply with vigorous  internationally agreed standards.  All actors involved in the arms trade must be held accountable. In adopting the Arms Trade Treaty  Member States came together to support a robust  legally binding commitment to provide a measure of hope to millions of people around the world. Some States have put in place strong systems for regulating transfers of weaponry and ammunition.  Yet  in order for the Treaty to be effective  all Governments must have well-functioning oversight of weapons transfers. Today we can look ahead with satisfaction to the date of this historic new Treaty’s entry into force.  Now we must work for its efficient implementation and seek its universalization so that the regulation of armaments — as expressed in the Charter of the United Nations — can become a reality once and for all.

Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s message to the High-Level event on Reducing Risks from Water-Related Disasters  in New York today: I am pleased to convey my greetings to all participants  and thank the Governments of Peru  Switzerland  Tajikistan and Thailand for hosting this valuable platform to discuss the challenge of water-related disasters. More than 80 percent of the economic damage caused by disasters each year can be attributed to floods  hurricanes and typhoons  tsunamis  storm surges  sea level rise and drought.  Losses are projected to rise exponentially as climate change further intensifies these natural hazards and current patterns of development increase our exposure. By transforming the way we develop  design and invest in our societies  we can reverse these trends.  We can minimize losses in flood-prone areas by prioritizing effective drainage.  Communities exposed to storms can save lives by investing in people-centred early warning systems.  Coastal cities can protect their future economic growth by accounting for sea-level rise. We have much to build on.  This includes the Hyogo Framework for Action  as well as your collective efforts to ensure that disaster risk reduction is reflected in the post-2015 framework. As we look ahead  I invite all Heads of State and Government tojoin the Third UN World Conference for Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai  Japan  next March.  Thank you once again for commitment.

2014-09-25,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16199.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.  Five years ago  I established the MDG [Millennium Development Goals] Advocacy Group to help us generate political will and mobilize global action to achieve the MDGs. I called the MDG Advocates our “global superheroes” in fighting poverty.  And  indeed  they have been “faster than a speeding bullet — more powerful than a locomotive” — and they have helped us leap over tall obstacles in a single bound! Together with these global leaders  and partnerships such as Roll Back Malaria  we have raised awareness  mobilized resources  and helped shape policy.  The MDGs have transformed the lives of millions of people.  Fewer people are in poverty.  More children are in school.  We are making inroads in the fight against malaria and tuberculosis.  Families and communities have greater access to an improved drinking water source. But we must do more to reach our targets on hunger and chronic child malnutrition.  Faster progress is needed to meet the goals of reducing child and maternal mortality and to improve access to sanitation. With 462 days remaining  I need your full support on two critical fronts:  first  to accelerate progress towards meeting the MDGs; [and] second  we must prepare for post-2015. We need a strong successor framework in place.  An ambitious agenda for sustainable development will require effective coordination and the contribution of all development partners.  Building mechanisms for effective partnerships and multi-stakeholder accountability will be critical to the success of the post-2015 development agenda.

Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s remarks at the high-level meeting on Somalia held in New York today: Thank you for your commitment to Somalia  and thank you for your participation discussing the situation in Somalia.  I am glad to see so many partners  including the leaders from Ethiopia  Italy and the United Kingdom who jointly suggested this meeting. I am delighted to welcome my co-chairs  the President of the Federal Republic of Somalia and the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. I would like to salute the leadership of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud  Prime Minister Abdiwali Sheikh Ahmed  the Federal Parliament and the Federal Government  in carrying out an ambitious political process under challenging circumstances. I wish to express appreciation to the African Union for its continued support to the Federal Government’s security and stabilization efforts  especially the latest joint operations against Al-Shabaab.  We pay tribute to AMISOM [African Union Mission to Somalia]  the Somali security forces and the Somali people for their courage and sacrifice. I also take this opportunity to recognize the staff of the United Nations  under the leadership of Special Representative Nicholas Kay  and other international partners serving in Somalia for their dedication to peace. The peace process in Somalia is gathering momentum.  Since we last met  the Federal Government has set out its “Vision 2016” plan for Somalia’s political transformation.  Agreements have been reached to forge interim administrations in south  south-west and central Somalia.  I welcome IGAD’s [Intergovernmental Authority on Development] important support to these developments. But there is no time to lose if elections are to take place in 2016 as the President has pledged.  I urge all Somalia’s political institutions to keep this process on track.  Parliament has a central role to play in establishing the National Independent Electoral Commission and the Boundaries and Federation Commission that must be delivered this year. National reconciliation remains crucial.  I welcome the efforts of the emerging interim regional administrations  together with the Federal Government  to convene inclusive reconciliation conferences.  Inclusive local administrations are also urgently needed in newly recovered areas.  The participation of women at all levels in these processes and in Somalia’s institutions is an imperative. Political progress also depends on security  the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights.  I welcome the recent discussions in London on building effective and human rights-compliant security forces.  I urge the Federal Government to firmly place human rights  especially the protection of women and children  at the centre of its state-building policies and programmes. The current operations to recover more locations from Al Shabaab are critical to enable delivery of critical supplies to communities cut off by the group’s blockades.  I remain extremely worried about the humanitarian situation.  Malnutrition rates are again on the rise.  If we do not increase humanitarian support  all other gains could be jeopardized. I am pleased to announce that the United Nations Multi-Partner Trust Fund under the Somali Compact is operational.  We are also working with the World Bank on an initiative to promote resilience and economic development in the Horn of Africa. There is much work still ahead.  I urge you  Mr. President  and the Federal Government to redouble efforts to deliver on “Vision 2016” and the Somali Compact.  Yet they cannot achieve this ambitious agenda alone. As we look forward to the High-level Partnership Forum in Copenhagen in November  I appeal to the international community to continue its support to Somalia so that its people can reap the dividends of peace.

2014-09-24,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16195.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.    Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s remarks to the Security Council high-level summit on foreign terrorist fighters  in New York today: President Obama  thank you for your leadership in convening this Security Council summit.  This is the second time that you have presided over this Council on a matter with grave implications for international peace and security. The world is witnessing a dramatic evolution in the nature of the terrorist threat.  In the last year  terrorist attacks have killed  maimed and displaced many thousands of civilians — the vast majority of them Muslims from Afghanistan to Somalia to Nigeria  from Iraq to Libya to Mali. These attacks have been carried out by violent extremists who thrive in conditions of insecurity and injustice  fragility and failed leadership.  These groups ruthlessly hijack religion to control territory and vital economic resources.  They brutalize women and girls.  They target and slaughter minorities.  They are the enemies of faith. As Muslim leaders around the world have said  groups like ISIL [Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant] — or Da’ish — have nothing to do with Islam  and they certainly do not represent a State.  They should more fittingly be called the “Un-Islamic Non-State”. Yet these groups have become a magnet for foreign terrorist fighters who are easy prey to simplistic appeals and siren songs.  The UN’s Al-Qaida/Taliban Monitoring Team estimates that more than 13 000 foreign terrorist fighters from over 80 Member States have joined ISIL and the Al Nusra Front. This growing phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters is a consequence — not a cause — of the conflict in Syria.  A long period of upheaval and  until recently  unresponsive leadership in Iraq — coupled with outrageous human rights abuses in Syria — have created a hothouse of horrors. There can be no genuine protection of civilians if extremist groups are permitted to act with impunity and the Syrian Government continues its assault on its own people. For more than a year  I have sounded the alarm about the vicious and unjustifiable actions of these groups and the danger they pose to Iraq  Syria  the wider region and international peace and security. We need a creative and comprehensive political strategy in Syria and beyond to stem the flow of foreign terrorist fighters.  Terrorists must be defeated — but we must do so in a way that avoids the deliberate acts of provocation that they set for us — victimization  further radicalization and more civilian deaths. Eliminating terrorism requires international solidarity and a multifaceted approach; among the many tools we must use  we must also tackle the underlying conditions that provide violent extremist groups the opportunity to take root. Immediate security issues must be addressed.  Over the longer term  the biggest threat to terrorists is not the power of missiles; it is the politics of inclusion.  It’s peaceful societies and respect for human rights.  It’s education  jobs and real opportunity.  It’s leaders who listen to their people and uphold the rule of law. Missiles may kill terrorists.  But good governance kills terrorism.  Free and independent societies — free from suffering  oppression and occupation — this is what will kill terrorism. I welcome the Council resolution just adopted and its call for strengthening implementation of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.  Through the UN Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force  we are stepping up efforts in support of Member States and regions seriously affected by terrorism. Through the UN Counter-Terrorism Centre  we are working with Member States to enhance understanding of the foreign terrorist fighter phenomenon and to develop and implement policies to combat their flow. Through our collective efforts  we must ensure that all counter-terrorism actions and policies are consistent with international human rights and humanitarian laws. As the custodian of the Charter of the United Nations  I want to emphasize that all measures must be fully in line with the goals and values and principles of the United Nations. I once again welcome the new unity of purpose in the Council on this issue under the leadership of President Obama.  I hope that this spirit will carry over to other pressing issues  particularly finally bringing peace to the people of Syria.  Thank you  Mr. President.

2014-09-24,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16194.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.    Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s message on the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons  to be observed on 26 September: The world has long recognized that nuclear disarmament offers the only absolute guarantee against the use of nuclear weapons  and that any such use would have catastrophic humanitarian consequences.  Nuclear disarmament is therefore not an idealistic dream  but an urgent necessity to meet the genuine security interests of all humanity. It has been 68 years since the General Assembly first identified the goal of achieving the elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. It has been 44 years since the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons entered into force  committing its States parties to undertake negotiations in good faith on nuclear disarmament.  The time has come for those negotiations to begin.  The lack of such negotiations is disrupting the delicate balance between international commitments to disarmament and non-proliferation. Six years ago  I offered a five-point proposal on nuclear disarmament that featured two possible paths to achieve this goal:  agreement on a framework of separate  mutually reinforcing instruments  or through a nuclear weapons convention  backed by a strong system of verification. What matters most is not which path is taken  but that the chosen path is heading in the right direction — towards the internationally agreed goal of the total elimination of nuclear weapons. This International Day is not merely one on which we call for limiting nuclear weapons  reducing their range  constraining their deployments or reducing their role in security policies.  It is also a day when the world community reflects on the many benefits that nuclear disarmament would offer  from enhanced security to the conservation of financial and scientific resources.  It is a day on which to imagine the consequences should the dangerous and fragile doctrine of nuclear deterrence fail. Let us revive nuclear disarmament as a top international priority  in the interest of the peace and security of all and of future generations.

2014-09-24,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16193.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.    Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s address “From turmoil to peace” to the General Assembly  in New York today: It is a great honour to welcome you to this renovated General Assembly Hall.  This great Hall is home to “we the peoples.”  It has been restored  renewed and reinvented for the twenty-first century.  I thank all of you for making it possible. The Capital Master Plan was not an easy project.  But you  the Member States  embraced the vision.  You made the investment.  Now we see the wonderful results:  a state-of-the-art space in which we shall work together to improve the state of the world. Please watch. [“Virtual ribbon-cutting” photo montage is screened.] We wanted to have  in fact  a grand opening ceremony.  Because of frugality and time we just wanted to have this virtual opening ceremony.  In the name of all peoples and all nations  I am now proud to officially declare this General Assembly Hall open for business.  Thank you.  You saved a lot of money by having this virtual opening ceremony.  Thank you very much for understanding. Every year at this time  hope fills this Hall — the hope embodied in the Charter of the United Nations; the hopes of leaders who speak from this podium; the hopes of people across the world who hear those promises.  This year  the horizon of hope is darkened.  Our hearts are made very heavy by unspeakable acts and the deaths of innocents.  Cold War ghosts have returned to haunt our times.  We have seen so much of the Arab Spring go violently wrong. Not since the end of the Second World War have there been so many refugees  displaced people and asylum seekers.  Never before has the United Nations been asked to reach so many people with emergency food assistance and other life-saving supplies.  Diplomacy is on the defensive  undermined by those who believe in violence.  Diversity is under assault by extremists who insist that their way is the only way.  Disarmament is viewed as a distant dream  sabotaged by profiteers of perpetual warfare. It may seem as if the world is falling apart  as crises pile up and disease spreads.  But leadership is precisely about finding the seeds of hope and nurturing them into something bigger.  That is our duty.  That is my call to you today. It has been a terrible year for the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  From barrel bombs to beheadings  from the deliberate starvation of civilians to the assault on hospitals  UN shelters and aid convoys  human rights and the rule of law are under attack.  After the latest tragedy in Gaza  Palestinians and Israelis seem more polarized than ever.  If we do not save the two-State solution  we will be left in a state of permanent hostilities.  The situation in and around Ukraine remains volatile. In South Sudan  a struggle for political power has killed thousands of people and exposed millions to the threat of famine.  The Central African Republic is fractured and traumatized.  Mali and the Sahel continue to suffer from insurgency  terrorism  the illicit drug trade and organized crime.  In Somalia  a coalition of African States confronts the terrorist group Al-Shabaab.  In Nigeria  Boko Haram’s murderous onslaught gains strength  with shocking impacts on women and girls. In Iraq and Syria  we see new depths of barbarity with each passing day  and devastating spillover effects across the region.  As Muslim leaders around the world have repeatedly said  there is nothing Islamic about the terrorist organizations wreaking havoc in the region.  These extremist groups are a clear threat to international peace and security that requires a multi-faceted international response.  We need decisive action to stop atrocity crimes and frank discussions on what created the threat in the first place.  The people of the region have been forced to walk on the broken shards of bad governance and bad decisions that failed to respect international law and basic human rights. Across the world  the fragility of States and institutions has never been more apparent.  Some have been hollowed out by corruption; others have pursued policies of exclusion that drive the victims towards anger  despair and violence. States must uphold their responsibility to govern — and govern for all their peoples.  Even where there is no overt warfare  violence still mars lives.  Men prey on women across the globe  from battlefields to streets  from public spaces to the privacy of the home.  Migrants face increasingly perilous journeys — and closed doors upon arrival. In many countries seen as models of integration  divisive politics are on the rise.  People are very good at seeing prejudice in others  but less so in themselves.  The trends that bring people together — instant communications  free trade and ease of travel — are also being exploited by forces that keep them apart. The world’s “fasten seat belt” light is illuminated.  Turbulence is testing the multilateral system  national institutions and people’s lives. Human rights provide one touchstone for our response.  The Human Rights Up Front initiative aims to place human rights at the centre of our thinking and our efforts in the field.  The protection of nearly 100 000 people at UN bases throughout South Sudan has been an early milestone of this new approach. The international community needs to be similarly sensitized to the value of human rights as an early warning mechanism.  I urge Member States to fulfil their responsibilities to their populations.  States also need to be open to discussing their own vulnerabilities.  Let us recall that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights not only proclaims a set of freedoms  it also warns that people will not stand idle if they are not protected.  We need to do far more to anticipate problems and reach early political consensus. To better meet the challenges before us  I have called for a review of United Nations peace operations and will appoint a high-level review panel in the coming weeks. The unity of the Security Council is crucial.  When the Security Council acts as one  we see results  such as the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons programme; agreement on a peacekeeping operation for the Central African Republic; timely support for the peace framework in the Great Lakes region of Africa.  By contrast  continued disunity over Syria has resulted in grave human suffering and loss of credibility for the Council and our institution. The General Assembly must also uphold its responsibilities and play its rightful role.  We must not let the smoke from today’s fires blind us to longer-term challenges and opportunities. Hope may be hard to discern  but it is there.  In clinics  classrooms and other places far from the spotlight  the development agenda is making remarkable progress.  Global poverty  child mortality and maternal deaths have been cut in half.  More remains to be done  but these and other gains show the power of the Millennium Development Goals and what we can do when we work together. Today an inspiring global conversation is taking place on an agenda for the next 15 years.  Earlier this month  small island developing States added their voices with the adoption of the Samoa Pathway  a far-reaching plan for addressing their unique vulnerabilities.  Two days ago in this Hall  we heard the appeals of the world’s indigenous peoples for an end to marginalization.  That same day  world leaders reaffirmed the importance of continuing to implement the ground-breaking consensus of the Cairo Conference on Population and Development. The conversation for the future we want has been one of the most inclusive efforts in United Nations history.  More than five million people have now voted in the My World survey.  I encourage millions more to log on and chime in.  What is emerging from our dialogue is remarkable in its vision — a universal agenda  applying to all countries  and a determination not to reduce but eradicate extreme poverty and hunger and to put all countries and communities on the path of truly sustainable development. The Open Working Group of the General Assembly has placed before us a proposed set of Sustainable Development Goals that will help us to complete the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals  overcome inequalities  protect the planet and build the future we want.  At the end of the year  at your request  I will provide a synthesis report that will set the stage as Member States begin their negotiations. Transformation is our goal.  I can think of no better place to start than with opening doors and shattering ceilings for women and girls.  Stereotypes continue to be deeply entrenched.  Look at any crisis — from poverty to disaster to disease to illiteracy — and you will see women and girls suffering the most.  We cannot fulfil 100 per cent of the world’s potential by excluding 50 per cent of the world’s people.  Climate action is integral to all our hopes.  Three days ago in the streets of our host city  New York  I joined hundreds of thousands of people in marching for a cleaner  greener future.  They sent a powerful message to the leaders — of their impatience  but also of opportunity. Yesterday’s Climate Summit was a landmark event.  We saw a great coming together of countries  capital  CEOs and citizens.  Multi-stakeholder coalitions took unprecedented action to reduce emissions  build resilience  and finance the transformation of our economies and societies.  We must convert this momentum into a meaningful  universal climate agreement in Lima this December and in Paris next year.  As one of the banners in the march said  we have a duty to “do what must be done”. Funding is crucial for the credibility of the climate and post-2015 development efforts.  Now is the time to more properly match global wealth with global need.  All resources  public and private  domestic and international  need to be tapped.  When budgets are cut to the bone  people bleed.  When resources are devoted to ever more sophisticated arms instead of ever greater human potential  we are all less secure. Leadership is also about getting our priorities straight  our policies right  and our investments working for people.  The next 15 months will be a defining period for global prosperity and stability.  I urge you to keep your ambitions high. The outbreak of Ebola in West Africa is an unprecedented crisis.  That is why I have established an unprecedented health operation — the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) — to mobilize all the resources needed to reinforce the work being done by the countries and communities affected.  The mission combines the expertise of the World Health Organization with the logistical capacities of the United Nations.  UNMEER personnel arrived in Ghana two days ago to establish the Mission’s headquarters.  The international community is rallying to assist local health workers. Now we need a twenty-fold surge in care  tracking  transport and equipment.  Food security is a growing concern  as food prices have gone up and food systems are in danger of breaking down.  We must also fight the virus of fear and misinformation.  Bans on travel or transport will not keep Ebola from getting out  but will keep medical personnel and supplies from getting in.  We need to isolate people affected by Ebola — but not the nations struggling to cope with it.  With leadership and solidarity  we can help the people of Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone bring the outbreak to an end and regain the path to a better future. The world recently marked the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War.  Like so many conflicts  that war started less from grand design than from small problems badly handled.  After the Second World War  the founding of the United Nations was a feat of global resolve.  The post-war planners were driven not only by the idea of “never again”  but by a vision of what the world could be if we “unite our strength”. Today  we face a profusion of mounting challenges.  People are crying out for protection from greed and inequality.  The United Nations must answer that call.  We are a century removed from the First World War  and have 70 years of experience with the United Nations.  Yet the world is still not as peaceful as it could and as it should be.  Today we face far more man-made crises than natural calamities.  We may not control Mother Nature  but who else but us is responsible for securing peace and justice in our world? War.  Poverty.  Ignorance.  Crises caused by people can be stopped by people.  I do not think we can yet feel comfortable about the world our generation is leaving to our children.  Still  I have hope.  I draw it from our Charter  our enduring guide in times of dramatic challenge and change.  I am continually inspired by the staff  peacekeepers  humanitarian workers  human rights defenders and others who bring our document  this Charter  to life. Just as we have renovated this great Hall for a new age  I look to you  Excellencies  Distinguished Heads of State and Government  to rebuild leadership and restore unity of purpose.  We can tackle any challenge — and we will  as united nations.  I thank you for your leadership. Thank you very much.

I am also deeply honoured by your decision to confer an award to me. South-South and triangular cooperation play a crucial role in advancing the global development agenda.  Together  as partners  we have made great progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.  Now we must turn that commitment and energy to achieving the post-2015 development agenda. South-South cooperation  including innovation and technology  will continue to be an essential component in this work and its relevance is increasing.  Developing countries provide 33 per cent of global investment  and that share is expected to grow.  Intra-South trade now exceeds Southern exports to the North. South and North alike continue to wrestle with serious challenges  from humanitarian crises and armed conflicts to poverty  inequality  malnutrition and vulnerability to climate change and weather-related shocks.  As we tackle these problems and seize opportunities for common progress  we must encourage further South-South collaboration among all partners — both public and private.

I thank Rabbi Arthur Schneier and the Appeal of Conscience Foundation for their efforts in promoting human rights  interfaith dialogue and cross-cultural understanding. You meet as world leaders gather for the annual session of the General Assembly  and on the day when the Climate Summit generated encouraging progress towards the action we need to address this existential threat. This is a time of turmoil and test for the human family.  From Syria to Iraq  from Ukraine to South Sudan and the Central African Republic  conflicts are displacing millions and taking a tragic toll.  We also face the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa. Our challenge is to address these emergencies while continuing to build the long-term pillars of peace by pressing ahead towards the Millennium Development Goals and shaping a bold new agenda for the period beyond the year 2015. What is clearer than ever is that multilateral solutions have a central role to play in our responses.  No one country can halt climate change.  No country acting alone can prevent the spread of Ebola.  No single organization can bring peace to Syria or halt the growing reach of extremist groups. The Appeal of Conscience Foundation will continue to be an invaluable voice in these efforts.

2014-09-23,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16190.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.  Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s closing remarks at the Climate Summit  in New York  today: I would like to express my sincere appreciation to all participants for their invaluable insights and contributions to the Climate Summit. At this point  allow me to present a summary of our deliberations after which we shall hear from a select number of special guests. Today was a great day — a historic day.  Never before have so many leaders gathered to commit to action on climate change.  I thank every one of you who came to New York with ambition and commitment. I asked for bold announcements from Governments  business  finance and civil society in five key areas.  The Summit delivered. First  we heard strong commitment for a meaningful  universal climate agreement in Paris next year  with a first draft to be presented in Lima in December. Leaders reaffirmed their determination to limit global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius by cutting emissions. Many leaders  from all regions and all levels of economic development  advocated for a peak in greenhouse gas emissions before 2020  decisively reduced emissions thereafter  and climate neutrality in the second half of this century.  We heard commitments to cut emissions from many countries. In addition  coalitions were announced in the areas of forestry  energy efficiency and transportation.  And leaders of the oil and gas industry  along with national Governments and civil society organizations  made a historic commitment to identify and reduce methane emissions by 2020. Second  on finance  public and private sources showed the way forward for mobilizing the finance we need.  Leaders expressed strong support for the Green Climate Fund.  Many leaders called for the Fund’s initial capitalization at an amount no less than $10 billion.  A total of $2.3 billion was pledged towards the Fund’s initial capitalization today  and others committed contributions by November 2014. A new coalition of Governments  business  finance  multilateral development banks and civil society leaders announced their commitment to mobilize upwards of $200 billion for financing low-carbon and climate-resilient development. Private banks announced they would issue $20 billion of green bonds and that they would double the market to $50 billion by 2015  next year.  The insurance industry committed to double its green investments to $82 billion by the same date  by next year.  A coalition of institutional investors committed to de-carbonize $100 billion by December 2015 and to measure and disclose the carbon footprint of at least $500 billion in investments — all of this by next year. Third:  carbon pricing.  This is one of the most powerful tools available for reducing emissions and generating sustainable development and growth.  Many leaders from Government and business supported putting a price on carbon through various instruments and called for intensified efforts to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. Thirty companies announced their alignment with the Caring for Climate Business Leadership Criteria on Carbon Pricing.  And  a number of leaders agreed to join a new Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition to drive action aimed at strengthening carbon pricing policies and redirecting investment. Fourth  we heard how strengthening resilience — both climate and financial — is a smart and essential investment.  Adaptation needs are growing  particularly for the least developed countries and small island developing States  which are most at risk and need most international support. Leaders agreed to strengthen and scale up the risk financing mechanisms for Africa and the Caribbean.  A comprehensive climate risk resilience initiative was also launched to support Pacific small island developing States.  Leaders from the insurance industry  representing $30 trillion in assets and investments  committed to creating a Climate Risk Investment Framework for industry-wide adoption by the end of next year. Fifth  new coalitions are forming to meet the full scope of the climate challenge.  The first Global Agricultural Alliance was launched to enable 500 million farmers worldwide to practice climate-smart agriculture by 2030. Leaders of the oil and gas industry  along with national Governments and civil society organizations  made a historic commitment to identify and reduce methane emissions by 2020. A new Compact of Mayors  representing 200 cities with a combined population of 400 million people  pledged new commitments to reduce annual emissions by between 12.4 and 16.4 per cent. Leaders from pension funds committed to de-carbonizing investments worth $100 billion and disclosing the carbon footprint of investments worth $500 billion. These are the highlights from my Chairman’s Summary  and this 2014 Climate Summit Chair’s Summary and Outcome Document will be distributed soon to the Member States for your easy reference and information. I thank all the leaders from Government  business  finance and civil society who came to New York with ambition and commitment. Looking forward  we must maintain the spirit of compromise and commitment that characterized our discourse.  We must fulfil and expand on all the pledges and initiatives brought forward today. As we walk together on the road to Lima and Paris in December 2014 and 2015  let us look back on today as the day we decided — as a human family — to put our house in order to make it liveable for future generations. Today’s Summit has shown that we can rise to the climate challenge.  I thank you for your leadership and commitment.  Thank you very much.

2014-09-23,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16189.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.    Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s opening remarks at the 2014 Climate Summit session on multi-stakeholder action (finance)  in New York  today: Welcome to this important session on multilateral and multi-stakeholder action.  Climate change is a risk to businesses and financial markets everywhere.  It threatens to undermine financial resilience and efforts to alleviate poverty and maintain sustained economic growth. We have  this afternoon  endorsed the call for putting a price on carbon.  I thank the World Bank and the UN Global Compact for taking the lead on this.  But while pricing carbon is critical  it will remain insufficient if not complemented by urgent direct action. There is no contradiction between climate action and economic stability and growth.  Indeed the two are complementary.  Tackling climate change offers enormous opportunities  but we must put the right national and international policies and frameworks in place. A key obstacle in combating climate change has been the level of financing required for accelerating the transformation towards low-carbon  resilient development.  The majority of this sum is needed in the developing world.  I have asked Governments to present bold commitments  consistent with their international obligation and level of development.  These include financial commitments. I am pleased to note that billions of dollars have been committed this morning and this afternoon towards the initial capitalization of the Green Climate Fund.  I thank the very generous contributions by the Republic of Korea in the amount of $100 million and also $10 million by the Government of Mexico.  I also take this opportunity to express my deepest thanks again for the generous support by the Government of France in the amount of $1 billion  as well as the German Government’s $1 billion.  I hope the other leaders will emulate this leadership. This is a positive beginning  and I thank all who have contributed. I am pleased to see National Development Finance Institutions from the developed and the developing world represented today.  I encourage them to scale up their contribution and commit to stronger policies that boost low carbon  resilient growth. But  no amount of public financing can turn the tide unless complemented by the private sector.  I have therefore asked the private sector to redirect investment commensurate with the scale of the challenge.  This includes disclosing exposure to carbon assets  boosting the Green Financing and Green Bond Market and substantially increasing investments in climate resilient infrastructure. These actions can  in turn  generate new markets  new innovative products  new employment opportunities and new productive forces.  They can consolidate and sustain growth while ensuring social and environmental objectives — including putting the world on a trajectory to limiting global temperature rise to less than 2°C. This is the beginning of a new era of cooperation.  More ambition and new synergies between you all are needed to push the global economy in the right direction.  Moving climate finance requires a multi-pronged and revitalized global partnership that will support a universal meaningful agreement in Paris next year. I invited you all here to make this partnership a reality.  I count on your leadership in realizing a new climate vision and implementing today’s commitments. Thank you for your leadership.

2014-09-23,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16188.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.    Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s remarks at the Private Sector Forum lunch  today  in New York: Distinguished Heads of State and Government and leaders from the private sector  I really appreciate the strong commitment and leadership which have been shown  demonstrated  during this morning’s session of the Summit meeting  and I really appreciate the many  many leaders from Governments and the business community. This is the largest ever meeting which has been gathered for the one single purpose of climate change. Normally during the General Assembly  two weeks  the Presidents and the Prime Ministers — they come and leave.  If we gather all the numbers for two weeks  it comes to about 130  140 maximum.  But it would be extremely difficult to have 125 Heads of State and Government in one place at one time in one single day.  That is a strong demonstration of their leadership  and I am very grateful to all the Heads of State and Government who are here today  and also business leaders.  Thank you very much. In that regard  today is a great day for climate action.  As Secretary-General  I am very moved  very touched.  I was very moved when I was marching among almost 400 000 people — not only New Yorkers  but people from all around the world.  [Former United States] Vice-President Al Gore was linking [arms with us]  and Leonardo DiCaprio  the famous celebrity  was also among the crowd  and I really appreciate it. In January  the World Economic Forum — known as the Davos Forum — devoted a full day to climate change  helping to lay the groundwork for the ambition we are seeing today. Then  in May  the United Arab Emirates organized the Abu Dhabi Ascent  which was a critical milestone in helping to forge partnerships and raise ambition even further. Today  we have already heard significant announcements.  [French] President [François] Hollande has announced $1 billion for the Green Climate Fund.  I was expecting that should be announced as 1 billion Euros.  I would welcome it if you would change [this to Euros]!  As you know  the German Chancellor has already announced $1 billion dollars. I have also heard many business leaders committing themselves and announcing to mobilize their funds for the Green Climate Fund as well as wise investment in renewable energies.  This is quite a moving day.  Some [announcements] will be truly transformational. Governments and the private sector are uniting behind the message that there is no competition between economic growth  business success and fighting climate change. Indeed  the opposite is true.  All people  communities and sectors stand to benefit from the vast opportunities presented by the transformation to climate-resilient  low-carbon economies. More and more companies realize this  and are acting — individually and in partnership with Governments and civil society. And I also appreciate the UN Global Compact for your UN Caring for Climate Initiative.  I never told them to do that.  They did it voluntarily.  There was no pressure; I will make it clear. This is the largest business coalition on climate  with 400 companies from around the world. But corporate emissions reductions are still small compared to their overall carbon footprint.  It is time for business  Governments  to go much further  much faster. To meet the target of [global temperature rise to] 2 degrees Celsius  we need emissions to peak by 2020.  That is why I have convened a UN principals meeting  so the UN system will become carbon neutral  completely  by 2020.  That is my firm commitment  and I applaud Mayor [Bill] De Blasio who announced on Sunday that New York City will have an 80 per cent reduction by 2050 and public office buildings will be carbon neutral by 2020 or 2025. We must then reduce emissions aggressively and attain carbon neutrality before the end of the century  but if we can do it by 2050  it will be much better. We need to do a list of three things. First  we must put a price on carbon.  This is one of the most powerful and necessary instruments for reducing emissions and generating innovation and finance for low-carbon  resilient growth.  Since you have already heard from Dr. Jim Yong Kim  President of the World Bank  I will not repeat. Nearly 40 countries and more than 20 cities  states and provinces already use carbon pricing.  Now  340 global [institutional] investors representing over $24 trillion in assets have called on Government leaders to provide stable  reliable and economically meaningful carbon pricing.  I welcome calls by leaders at this Summit for a price on carbon and intensified efforts to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies.   And today  a group of 30 companies have stepped up as carbon pricing champions.  Each has endorsed the Business Leadership Criteria on Carbon Pricing set out by the UN and partners.  Their pledge entails three key dimensions:  first  pricing; second  responsible policy advocacy; and third  reporting publicly on their efforts. These last two criteria — policy advocacy and reporting publicly — are essential complements to progress on carbon pricing.  Companies must walk the walk and talk the talk  advocating for smart regulatory policy. The third component is public reporting.  I commend all of you in this room who are pioneering progress on reporting.  We need everyone to follow suit. Thank you to all of you who will make major commitments today with your supply chains  your business models  and your investments.  Let us work together to make this world environmentally sustainable and to leave this planet Earth  our only planet Earth  to our succeeding generations in a responsible way. I count on your leadership.  Thank you very much.

2014-09-23,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16187.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.    Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s closing remarks at the 2014 Climate Summit joint conclusion of the morning session of national action announcements  in New York  23 September: I thank you all for your participation.  This morning we have heard overwhelming commitment to a low-carbon and climate resilient pathway.  Change is in the air.  The race is on  and you are leading by example.  All must act  and all must act together. You have said that genuine commitment and action by all is needed  with developed countries taking the lead.  You have announced a wide-range of commitments and actions to reduce emissions.  Many have cited that a low-carbon pathway and economic growth and development can indeed go hand in hand.  The European Union has assured they will adopt the 40 per cent emissions reductions target this October  and substantial financial commitments to support climate action in the European Union and abroad.  Grenada issued a call for all island States to go 100 per cent renewable.  China announced that it will peak its emissions as soon as possible and that it will double its support for the South-South Cooperation on Climate Change. We have heard significant pledges of finance and resources.  Finance is the enabler of what we want to achieve.  This morning  you have acknowledged its crucial importance.  Private finance is out there  and public finance can be the lever to access it. I commend the commitments we have heard to capitalize on the Green Climate Fund and meet the 100-billion-dollar-a-year target for climate finance.  Several countries in the ECOSOC [Economic and Social Council] Chamber this morning announced new contributions to the Green Climate Fund  notably the Republic of Korea and Denmark  and with others stating their intention to pledge.  And  of course  I welcome generous pledges at $1 billion each by the President of France and by the Chancellor of Germany. Pricing carbon was also raised as an instrument to generate political and market will to cut emissions and to mobilize finance for low-carbon growth and climate resilience.  Many leaders from both developed and developing countries emphasized that climate change affects us all  but for some the challenges are overwhelming.  We must not forget the importance of increasing support for adaptation and the need to build resilience.  Leaders have affirmed the importance of the UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] process in this regard. There are as yet still unmet expectations  but there is still hope.  There is overwhelming commitment to reach a meaningful universal climate agreement that keeps us under 2°C.  We need a comprehensive and durable agreement based on science. I commend the countries  both developed and developing  that have indicated their intentions to bring their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions well before Paris and as early as the first quarter of 2015. As the President of the United States stated so well  “Some countries have a special responsibility to lead  but all must do their part.  That is what the United Nations is all about.” The morning has shown the promise that the rest of the day holds  and the promise of our future.  Governments  the private sector  finance  cities and civil society are all working together to deliver the scale of climate action that is truly needed.  Let us build on this momentum through the afternoon and through 2015 and beyond.  Thank you for your leadership  thank you.

2014-09-23,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16186.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.    Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s remarks at the Climate Summit press conference in New York today: Good morning  bonjour.  It is a great pleasure to see you today.  Thank you for your commitment in covering climate change discussions. Before I focus on climate change  let me just say a few words  with the understanding of the two Presidents.  It was not scheduled  but I need to say something about the situation in Syria.  Please note that we will take questions only on climate change.  I am going to say something about the United Nations position on Syria. For more than a year  I have sounded the alarm bells about the brutality of extremist armed groups in Syria and the critical threat they pose to Syria and to international peace and security.  While the rise of these extremist groups in Syria is a consequence and not a cause of Syria's tragic civil war  there can be no justification for their barbarity and the suffering they impose on the Syrian people. I welcome the international solidarity to confront this challenge  as demonstrated by the unanimous passage of Security Council resolution 2170 (2014) just a few weeks ago.  Confronting terrorist groups operating in Syria requires a multifaceted approach.  This approach should be designed to address the immediate security risks  to stop atrocity crimes and  over the longer term  to eliminate the conditions in which these groups take root. I urge the world leaders gathered in New York  especially those participating in tomorrow’s Security Council summit on foreign terrorist fighters  to come together decisively in support of efforts to confront these groups.  As the custodian of the principles of the United Nations  I would like to underscore the importance that all measures must be fully in line with the Charter of the United Nations and need to operate strictly in accordance with international humanitarian law. I have placed the protection of civilians at the top of my agenda.  In the case of Syria  there can be no genuine protection if extremist groups are permitted to act with impunity and if the Syrian Government continues to commit gross human rights violations against its own citizens.  Protecting the Syrian people requires immediate action  but action that is rooted in the principles of the United Nations. I regret the loss of any civilian lives as a result of strikes against targets in Syria.  The parties involved in this campaign must abide by international humanitarian law and take all necessary precautions to avoid and minimize civilian casualties.  I am aware that today’s strikes were not carried out at the direct request of the Syrian Government  but I note that the Government was informed beforehand.  I also note that the strikes took place in areas no longer under the effective control of that Government.  I think it is undeniable — and the subject of broad international consensus — that these extremist groups pose an immediate threat to international peace and security. Thank you for your attention.  Now let me turn to climate change  the subject of this press conference.  I am honoured to be joined by a number of very important guests. Climate change has been a priority for me since I took office.  We need to take action now to limit global temperature rise.  We need all hands on deck to ride this storm.  That is why I called this Summit. This gathering is unprecedented.  More than 120 world leaders  joined by many more business  finance and civil society leaders have come to focus on climate change.  But this Summit is not about talk.  The Climate Summit is producing actions that make a difference. This weekend hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets around the world to demand leadership and results.  I joined the marchers here in New York.  They gave me the box with 2 million signatures.  They asked me to bring their voices into the halls of the United Nations.  That is what I have done.  Our duty now is to listen. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced this morning that New York City is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by 2050.  Today  a coalition of more than 200 mayors  representing 400 million people  will sign a mayor’s compact to reduce annual emissions by between 12.4 and 16.4 per cent. Announcements on agriculture and forests will highlight a commitment by many of the world’s largest and most well-known companies to adapt their supply chains to reduce emissions and build resilience to climate change.  They will assist 500 million farmers in the process. Oil and gas companies are today announcing initiatives that will advance efforts to curb the release of methane gas  a highly potent greenhouse gas.  Some of the largest financial institutions  investors  banks and insurance companies will announce that they will shift more than 200 billion dollars toward building low-carbon economies by 2015. Countries are also making significant national announcements.  I would now like to turn to the leaders of France and Peru  who will be leading the negotiating process toward a meaningful universal climate [agreement.].  They are here to announce their national actions to address climate change.  I would like to invite President Hollande to speak  followed by President Humala. [President François Hollande of France; President Ollanta Humala of Peru; Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma  Chair of the African Union; President of the World Bank  Dr. Jim Yong Kim; Eduardo Paes  Mayor of Rio de Janeiro; Helge Lund  CEO of the Statoil Group; Mats Andersson  CEO of AP4; and David Maclennan  President and CEO of Cargill then addressed the media.] Ladies and gentlemen  I have been repeating many  many times  but let me just repeat what I have been saying.  I was told that communication is repetition.  Just a one-time message may not be sufficient.  Therefore  I am again — even though you have heard a lot of eloquent speakers during this morning — but I have to repeat again:  climate change is the defining issue of our time.  It is not a distant threat.  It is coming and approaching much  much faster than we may think.  The United Nations was flooded for the first time in 70 years. All of us have a stake in this fight and all of us can make a difference.  Every action counts  large and small.  The tendency is that they only look to the Governments  but now all business communities are on board  and even the individual person.  They can make a difference.  Just using sparingly even one single jug of water  or sparing use of electricity — all this will make a difference. We cannot negotiate with Mother Nature.  Mother Nature does not wait.  So  it is us human beings who have to adapt to the changing situation.  There can be no Plan B because we don’t have a Planet B.  The way we consume seems to suggest that we have another planet Earth.  We don’t have that luxury. Leaders must set the world on a trajectory to limit global warming below 2 degrees centigrade.  There is no more time for business as usual.  The more we delay  the more we will have to pay. We need to cut emissions and work towards carbon neutrality. The United Nations has made a firm commitment that we will make all the United Nations systems carbon [neutral] by 2020.  This is what we have decided just a couple of weeks ago. We need to invest more money in tomorrow’s green economy.  We need to put a price on carbon and pollution.  And we need to strengthen resilience to the changes to come.  That means getting all hands on deck. Again  I thank you very much for your strong commitment.  Now  my regret is that I may have to run without being able to answer your questions  because I have to conclude this [Climate Change] Summit meeting.  I cannot make all the leaders wait.  But  I have the Assistant Secretary-General who is the head of climate change research policy — chief policy adviser for the United Nations — Bob Orr.  He will be happy to answer your questions.  I hope you will understand.  Thank you very much.

2014-09-23,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16185.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.    Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑Moon’s message  as delivered by Jeffrey Feltman  Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs  to the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum fifth ministerial plenary meeting  in New York  today: I am pleased to convey my greetings to the fifth ministerial plenary of the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum.  Let me begin by thanking all participants for partnering with us in implementing the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  to Turkey  for having shepherded the General Assembly resolution in June  and for your resolve to move our collective efforts beyond reaction towards prevention of ever more complex terrorist threats. The General Assembly has called for closer cooperation between Member States  the United Nations and other international organizations and forums like the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum.  Allow me to point to three opportunities for greater collaboration:  countering the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters; addressing conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism; and assisting especially affected regions. First  recent events involving terrorist groups  such as ISIL  Boko Haram  Al-Shabaab and others  undermine the core values of the United Nations.  I welcome the initiative of President [Barak] Obama to convene a summit meeting of the Security Council tomorrow devoted to countering terrorism and addressing the rise of foreign terrorist fighters.  I hope the Council will adopt strong and decisive measures to enable Member States to address this growing threat within the context of respect for international humanitarian law and human rights.  For its part  the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre has launched a major project on this challenge. Second  the Hedayah Centre and the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund underscore the priority of addressing conditions that are conducive to the spread of terrorism.  Both the United Nations and the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum have focused on addressing kidnapping for ransom and on building stronger national criminal justice systems.  I welcome the adoption of the various Forum memoranda  which provide good practices and guidance and help support the implementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Third  with respect to assisting regions such as the Sahel that have seen especially notable rises in terrorist activity  we are cooperating closely in addressing the growing threat.  With groups choosing fragile regions as their bedrock  concerted efforts are needed not only to stabilize the regions concerned but also to prevent a further export and destabilization of other countries. The United Nations is making progress in further enhancing coordination and coherence through more than 200 capacity-building projects being implemented by the 34 Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force entities.  Such activities will also enable a stronger partnership with the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum and help ensure that our actions lead to sustained impact on the ground.  We are determined to provide all States  especially those at the front line  with the assistance they need to counter this menace effectively and in a manner consistent with international human rights standards. Terrorism presents a great challenge to our collective principles and values.  I am confident that together we can surmount these challenges through close coordination and complementarity in our work.

2014-09-23,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16184.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.    Following are UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s opening remarks at the 2014 Climate Summit  in New York  today: Good morning.  Thank you for coming to this unprecedented and important gathering today. Looking at that film made me think of my childhood.  I grew up poor in war-torn Korea.  I dreamed of peace.  I dreamed of prosperity.  I dreamed of opportunity.  Sitting here today is  in so many ways  a dream come true. But today the dreams of people throughout the world hang in the balance.  Climate change threatens hard-won peace  prosperity  and opportunity for billions of people.  Today  we must set the world on a new course. Climate change is the defining issue of our age.  It is defining our present.  Our response will define our future.  To ride this storm we need all hands on deck. That is why we are here today.  We need a clear vision. The human  environmental and financial cost of climate change is fast becoming unbearable.  We have never faced such a challenge.  Nor have we encountered such great opportunity.  A low-carbon  climate-resilient future will be a better future:  cleaner  healthier  fairer  more stable.  Not for some  but for all. There is only one thing in the way:  us  we.  That is why I have asked you to be here today.  Thank you for your leadership.  I am asking you to lead.  We must cut emissions.  Science says they must peak by 2020  and decline sharply thereafter.  By the end of this century we must be carbon neutral.  We must not emit more carbon than our planet can absorb. No one is immune from climate change.  Not even these United Nations Headquarters  which were flooded during Superstorm Sandy.  We must invest in climate-resilient societies that protect all  especially the most vulnerable. I ask all Governments to commit to a meaningful  universal climate agreement in Paris in 2015  and to do their fair share to limit global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius. To do that  we must work together to mobilize money and move markets.  Let us invest in the climate solutions available to us today. Economists have shown that this comes at minimal extra cost  while the benefits to our people and our planet are monumental.  We need all public finance institutions to step up to the challenge.  And we need to bring private finance from the sidelines.  We must begin to capitalize the Green Climate Fund.  And we must meet the broader 100 billion dollar-a-year pledge made in Copenhagen.  Let us also put a price on carbon.  There is no more powerful way to drive the market transformation we need. All these actions demand collaboration  cooperation and coalitions — today and all the way through to the Paris agreement next year. The United Nations is doing its part.  We will be climate-neutral by 2020.  All around the world  people around the world are acting.  Two days ago I was part of a massive people’s climate march in New York  together with Mayor [Bill] de Blasio of New York City.  I was overwhelmed by the energy of the tens of thousands of people.  In cities around the world  hundreds of thousands of people called for action.  They demanded that leaders lead. That is why we are here today.  We are not here to talk.  We are here to make history  today.  Thank you for your leadership. Thank you.

Following is the text of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s video message in support of the Global Education Countdown  in New York today: I would like to thank all of you for your support of the Global Education Countdown and my Global Education First Initiative. I am working hard with my Special Envoy Mr. Gordon Brown  as well as with UN agencies and global leaders  to make education for children the high priority it must be if we are to build the future we want. Over the past year  from Nigeria to Pakistan  we have seen education come under attack.  Moreover  so many millions of children are not getting the schooling they need for the best possible start in life. We must redouble our efforts to get children in school and ensure they get a quality education.  Education is a basic human right  and I am strongly committed to delivering on this promise. I am very encouraged that young people across the world have launched the “Up for School” campaign  including a petition you hope to make the biggest in history. Like all of you  I am “Up For School”. I wish you every success.  You can count on my support. Thank you.

2014-09-22,http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16182.doc.htm,Welcome to the United Nations. It’s your world.    Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s message  as delivered by Angela Kane  High Representative for Disarmament Affairs  to the fifty-eighth regular session of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) General Conference  in Vienna today: I am pleased to send greetings to the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The IAEA continues to serve as an indispensable forum for international nuclear cooperation and as a sentinel against nuclear proliferation.  To carry out these obligations effectively is no easy task  but time and again  the IAEA has risen to the challenge. The past year has spawned many such challenges. The aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi accident has justifiably continued to dominate the international conversation on nuclear safety.  There is a growing recognition that the use of nuclear power requires a strong nuclear safety culture  including the adoption and implementation of effective international safety standards. In the same way  nuclear security has also remained at the forefront of international concerns  and every care must be taken to minimize the threat of nuclear terrorism. In March  I attended the third Nuclear Security Summit  in The Hague  during which the leaders of over 50 countries pledged their determination to strengthen international cooperation in this area.  They also reaffirmed the IAEA’s central role  and I have full confidence in the IAEA’s ability to continue to perform this role admirably. The IAEA has also continued its work to ensure that the use of nuclear power will not contribute to nuclear weapons proliferation.  In this regard  I am pleased to note that there are now 124 States with additional protocols in force. With respect to efforts to ensure the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme  I welcome the progress made by Iran and the IAEA under the Framework of Cooperation  and I encourage the parties to expedite their efforts aimed at resolving all outstanding issues.  The extraordinary support by the IAEA for the Joint Plan of Action has also been essential in providing the political space for diplomacy to work. Regrettably  due to the continued lack of access  the IAEA has remained unable to verify the status of the nuclear programme of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).  I once again encourage the DPRK to work towards building confidence and mutual trust with its neighbours to enhance peace and stability in the region.  This would facilitate the resumption of diplomatic dialogue on the peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue  leading to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. I commend the Director-General and the IAEA staff for their continuing efforts to help Member States realize the benefits of nuclear energy while protecting against its misuse.  And I look forward to the continued partnership of the IAEA and the United Nations in our shared efforts towards a world free of nuclear weapons. Please accept my best efforts for a productive conference.

Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‑moon’s message for World Tourism Day  27 September: This year’s observance of World Tourism Day focuses on the ability of tourism to fully empower people.  Engaging local populations in tourism development builds stronger and more resilient communities. Tourism helps people to develop a variety of skills.  As a service sector with cross-cutting impact on agriculture  construction or handicrafts  tourism creates millions of jobs and business opportunities.  Its capacity to lift people from poverty  promote gender empowerment and help protect the environment has made it a vital tool for achieving positive change in communities across the world. Harnessing tourism´s benefits will be critical to achieving the sustainable development goals and implementing the post-2015 development agenda.

Following is UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s message for World Maritime Day  to be observed 25 September: At a time when the world is beset by conflict and crisis  it is easy to forget that  day in and day out  the international shipping industry works quietly and efficiently to keep the wheels of global trade in motion and ensure the timely delivery of the goods and commodities on which we all rely. For more than 50 years  international conventions developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have made global shipping progressively safer  more secure and more environment-friendly.  There are more than 50 in all.  Collectively  they are aimed at strengthening maritime safety and security  protecting the marine environment  mitigating the negative effects of accidents or establishing regulations covering liability and compensation for damage. The real value of those conventions can be fully realized only if they are properly implemented.  This entails early entry into force  broad participation  effective policies and programmes  stringent oversight and vigorous enforcement.  Shipping States  coastal States and the shipping industry itself all have a part to play. On World Maritime Day  let us recall the often unheralded but always vital contribution by international shipping to peoples and communities all over the world.

Je vous remercie de participer à cette quatrième réunion du Mécanisme régional de suivi (13+4) de l’Accord-cadre pour la paix  la sécurité et la coopération pour la République démocratique du Congo et la région.  Je salue le leadership du Président de l’Angola et Président de la Conférence internationale sur la région de Grands Lacs  José Eduardo dos Santos. À notre troisième réunion  qui s’est tenue au Siège de l’Union africaine  à Addis-Abeba  à la fin janvier  vous avez approuvé le Plan d’action régional et les 15 activités prioritaires pour l’application de l’Accord-cadre.  Vous avez également demandé que le Comité d’appui technique présente un rapport d’évaluation sur la mise en œuvre du plan. J’ai le plaisir de vous annoncer que ce rapport est prêt  Il rend compte des progrès et contient des recommandations utiles.  Mon Envoyé spécial et le Représentant spécial du Président de l’Union africaine vous le présenteront dans un instant. Pour que les causes profondes du conflit qui déchire la RDC et la région puissent être réglées  il faut que soit réaffirmée la volonté de donner effet rapidement à tous les engagements nationaux et régionaux énoncés dans l’Accord-cadre. Dans les années qui viennent  des élections déterminantes se tiendront dans plusieurs pays de la région des Grands Lacs.  La culture démocratique de la région doit s’en trouver renforcée.  J’espère que les pays concernés en sortiront plus forts  plus unis et plus stables. Ces derniers mois  des progrès ont été faits par rapport à plusieurs des engagements énoncés dans l’Accord-cadre.  Les groupes armés sont moins à même d’attaquer les civils dans l’est de la République du Congo  surtout depuis la défaite de l’ancien M23  fin 2013. Les conditions de sécurité se sont ainsi améliorées dans la région. But several armed groups continue their activities.  The Nairobi Declarations of the Kampala process have been implemented too slowly.  And there remains a lack of trust among some countries of the region. Despite these challenges  I am confident that with focus and dedication  we can stay on course for sustainable peace and stability in the region.  I welcome the collective and unequivocal message to the FDLR [Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda] that they should voluntarily surrender and disarm before 2 January 2015. I call on you to develop a comprehensive plan to deal with the FDLR through non-military means and  if necessary  through military action.  We should spare no effort to end the instability that has affected millions of people and impeded development and prosperity in the region for far too long.  The region and the international community must continue speaking with one voice and coordinating actions. My Special Envoy has just concluded his inaugural meetings with several leaders in the region.  I have specifically asked him to continue to work closely with you to ensure that the peoples of the Great Lakes region benefit from greater peace dividends in the coming months.  I reiterate my appeal to donors  especially the African Development Bank  the European Union  the World Bank and bilateral partners  to remain committed to supporting initiatives for peace  security and cooperation in the region. Let us strengthen our resolve to join forces and achieve our shared priorities.  We must intensify national and regional efforts — with international support — to address the root causes of the conflict in eastern DRC.  We must remove the threat posed by armed groups.  We must speed up the implementation of the Nairobi Declarations of the Kampala process  including the repatriation of eligible former M23 [23 March Movement] elements to the DRC.  And we must continue building trust and confidence among countries of the region. This will bring sustainable peace and security to the Great Lakes region to benefit the people there  the continent of Africa and beyond.

Your Excellency President Michelle Bachelet of Chile  Under-Secretary-General Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka  Head of UN Women  Mary Robinson  Special Envoy on Climate Change and President of the Mary Robinson Foundation — Climate Justice  Excellencies  Ladies and gentlemen  I am pleased to send greetings to this important forum on the eve of the Climate Summit. As we forge a new development agenda and work to combat climate change  we must listen to women’s voices and act on their concerns and needs. Climate change is an issue for all people  everywhere.  But the poor suffer disproportionately  and among poor populations  women  girls and infants are the most vulnerable. Any climate change agreement or disaster risk reduction strategy must take gender into account.  We can do that best by recognizing women’s leadership. We see it everywhere — from the small farmer planting trees  to the urban planner designing the low-carbon cities; from the student working to become a solar engineer  to the head of government approving climate-friendly policies. You recognize these women because you are these women.  Because you stand as examples  other women and girls can follow your lead.  I salute and encourage you. Tomorrow  leaders from government  business  finance and civil society will meet at the Climate Summit.  I have asked for bold announcements and transformative actions that will reduce emissions and strengthen climate resilience. I am hoping for renewed political will for a meaningful  universal climate agreement in 2015. I expect the voices of women to be heard.  With your leadership and commitment we can secure a sustainable future for all women and girls  men and boys.

The decision demonstrates the European Union’s continued worldwide leadership addressing climate change  and will also set a new standard for all countries in support of the upcoming global negotiations.
